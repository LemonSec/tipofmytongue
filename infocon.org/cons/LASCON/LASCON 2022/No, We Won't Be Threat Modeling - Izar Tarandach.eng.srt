1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
[Music]

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,489
[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,780
[Music]

6
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,000
thanks everyone for coming today I sort

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,699
of see you as Shadows because of that

8
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,980
light I may end up this with a with a

9
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,059
tan myself

10
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,979
there's a lot of light in here on my

11
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,900
face but uh yeah so uh the subtitle of

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,580
this presentation could be as you can

13
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,460
see from the picture

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,740
because the idea is that sometimes we we

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,560
can try as much as we can and teams will

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,479
just not get on boarding yeah on board

17
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,240
with the idea of trust mother

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,860
so first of all who am I my name is

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,900
I am a senior staff engineering at

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,820
datadog

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,799
I've been doing the security thing for a

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,700
long long long long time and uh lately

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,420
I've been focusing mostly on Modern

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,920
stlcs how to put things like agile

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
together how to get processes in place

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
so that they can support uh secure

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,119
development and secure design

28
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,060
and uh now I'm looking into the thinning

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,100
border between observability and

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,979
security expect more on that

31
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,560
one of uh if not the call for filling

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,020
for fame is that I am the lead Dev for

33
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,219
pi TM

34
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,979
which is one of the first if not the

35
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,160
first threat modeling from with s codes

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,020
you choose tools out there and uh if you

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,660
happen to like by DM or the idea of IDM

38
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,099
uh stickers are available so if you if

39
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,020
you have space on your notebook or

40
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,260
something let me know uh I am also the

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,420
co-author of a book a rally book called

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,099
threat modeling and practical guide for

43
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,500
development teams where the great

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Medicals and I uh try to put some of

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,180
this stuff that we've been practicing

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,959
and and trying out uh index form so that

47
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,980
people can

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,440
learn and get something out of it and I

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,080
am a very proud member of the threat

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
modeling Manifesto working group

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,440
together with Chris sitting there in the

52
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,140
back in the back and we even got a shout

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,319
out from Jim this morning so happy

54
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,360
um of course the standard disclaimer

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
applies My Views are mine not my

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,040
employers they don't pay me for that and

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,660
all the Arts that you can see here is

58
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,720
courtesy either of greatest so

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
gratitisography or the IMG creator

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,379
so what are we talking about today

61
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,319
so this is about applying soft skills to

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,120
the big practice of threat modeling

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
meaning you

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,980
we are not talking about the soft skills

65
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,379
while doing threat modeling that's

66
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
something that if you want more details

67
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,099
you can look at uh some of Adam's

68
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,080
shostak's presentations he has great

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,239
material on that on how to apply soft

70
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,920
skills and soft skills while you're

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
doing it while you're talking to teams

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,220
while talking to people

73
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,120
uh now we are looking a bit on the

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,340
higher level of that how do we get

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,500
people behind this whole threat modeling

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,580
idea thing

77
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,180
if you're sitting here I want to

78
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,000
believe that by now you agree with me

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,459
that shot modeling is a good thing

80
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,480
right

81
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,519
so this is the point where we raise

82
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,700
hands how many of you today actively do

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,319
threat modeling in your environments

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
okay okay occasionally the end actually

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,780
okay anyway I got at least more than

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
half the the room so that's already a

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,460
plus so we're going to briefly take a

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,259
look at why I believe that they're good

89
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,080
just to level set everybody

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,419
but the point is that some organizations

91
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:37,680
do have difficulties and by

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,780
organizations that I'm going from the

93
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,240
top down to the pair programming people

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
all levels at some point they look at

95
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,919
their modeling and say not for me

96
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,479
variety of reasons we're going to look

97
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,860
at some of them

98
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,040
but uh the idea is

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
if you fall into one of those scenarios

100
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,180
if you have an organization at any level

101
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,160
that's saying no to track modeling what

102
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
can you do

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,419
and what I'm trying to do here is not

104
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,240
bring you a list of suggestions but try

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,280
to bring you into the places where I

106
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,160
experience this where I saw this and

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,380
what I try to change the situation what

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,500
what word what worked a bit less

109
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,639
so

110
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,040
just to situate everybody

111
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,080
how did I get here and why do I think

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,820
that I have any kind of

113
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,800
double quotes authority to talk about

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
this stuff

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,080
it All Began actually not in 2018 it All

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Began in 2010

117
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,840
I was uh at the product Security office

118
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,639
at EMC

119
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
and my boss Britney Sunday

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
came to me with an interesting challenge

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,240
the way that the the PSO the broad

122
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,699
Security Office worked is

123
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,020
of all the products of uh

124
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,560
EMC we had a bunch a very small bunch of

125
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,380
Security Consultants each one of us got

126
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,139
a bunch a very big bunch of products

127
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,720
for ourselves and we automatically

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,300
became the security champions for those

129
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,840
products right and the idea that she had

130
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,500
was she wanted me to come up with a

131
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,560
threat model as a service

132
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,360
thanks

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,560
you know what

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,720
sounded good sounded like a great

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,759
Challenge and it sounded like something

136
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,960
that could have

137
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,940
some real impact right

138
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,100
so you go home and you start thinking

139
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,660
and thinking and thinking and thinking

140
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,060
and

141
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,039
I think it's safe to say

142
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,319
hundreds of products they had no not

143
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,259
many hundreds but more than 100. teams

144
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,780
all over the place all over the the

145
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,220
Ward

146
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,039
with that different cultures teams that

147
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,560
were separated geographically

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,220
teams that didn't even have the same

149
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,720
organizational structure some of them

150
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,240
have had Architects some didn't some of

151
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,300
them had uh staff Engineers some didn't

152
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,319
and

153
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,259
to try and bring it all into into a way

154
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,259
that you could as a service provide

155
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,880
threat modeling to each one of these

156
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,440
different teams

157
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,120
at the different rhythms that they

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,979
worked with the different environments

159
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,259
that they had all those constraints

160
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,900
and respond with we have five people to

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,960
do all these threat models

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,319
turned out to be very much impossible

163
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,259
right and that's when it became clear to

164
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,440
me that threat modeling is inherently an

165
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,300
activity that happens

166
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,280
at the level of the person coding

167
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
say that again in different in a

168
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,460
different way

169
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,160
if you are coding today

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,660
in the environments that we have today

171
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,300
devops libraries all that good stuff

172
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
Frameworks all that good stuff

173
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
you are inherently making security

174
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,300
decisions

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,819
at every step of the way and each one of

176
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,940
those has a value for threat modeling

177
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,940
so we are out of that very waterfall

178
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,880
based model where you had one person

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,220
doing all the design decisions and then

180
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,080
bringing cascading them down to the team

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,300
and they would merely go and just

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,099
execute whatever they they were being

183
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,180
told to

184
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,400
today you have those things that happen

185
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,319
in real time and somebody has to make a

186
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,879
decision in real time and those impact

187
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,500
on the threat model

188
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,000
so in 2018 I came up with this

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,259
basically rant

190
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,679
where I looked at the the number of cves

191
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,599
that we were seeing ever since we

192
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,059
started counting them and even though we

193
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,880
started having great tools great

194
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,279
guidance great documentation great

195
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,620
Frameworks and all that that number of

196
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,040
CVS just kept going up and my conclusion

197
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,959
at the time was it's not that we got

198
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,820
better at finding CVS

199
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,279
it's just that even though we have all

200
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,800
this stuff we are not using it right

201
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,260
and things are just they keep happening

202
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,500
again and again and again and again

203
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,899
so in this one I said hey we have to

204
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,660
train people differently we have to give

205
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,300
them security fundamentals rather than

206
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,560
how to's

207
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,240
and we have to lead them through the

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,820
idea that if you develop you are a

209
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,480
security person

210
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,060
and that brought me 2 2019

211
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,220
threat model every story which is my

212
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,019
personal motto I think that the only

213
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,180
resolution that we can actually impact

214
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,800
day-to-day development with a threat

215
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,080
model is if that threat model gets

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
changed every time that's something that

217
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,899
needs to change

218
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,320
happens in real time in other words

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,560
you're a developer you got a new story

220
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,779
take it look at it does it have any kind

221
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,760
of security value if it doesn't throw it

222
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,860
away just not throw it away do it and

223
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,820
move on

224
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
if it does have some security value then

225
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,920
hey update your chat model that's all

226
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,560
simple right it's not that simple but

227
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
it's simple

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,459
so that was my my big one

229
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,399
in that one also I introduced what I

230
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,500
came to call ctm continuous threat

231
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,540
modeling a methodology to do exactly

232
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
that

233
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,760
model every story

234
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,000
then

235
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,940
Pi TM a tool you write code you get

236
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,620
address model

237
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,980
but it also came that Kickback what do

238
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,720
you mean threat model of a story who has

239
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,880
the time for that who has the resources

240
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,980
for that who knows that

241
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,740
trust modeling is is black magic not

242
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,360
everybody can do it right

243
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,760
and this was my no everybody can do it

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
and here's how and here are some tools

245
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,899
and here are some resources that you can

246
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,220
use and yes it's doable

247
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,079
and then comes okay your team is doing

248
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,820
it that's awesome you have the security

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
team you have your team threat modeling

250
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,240
is happening you are even doing the

251
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,040
continuous Thing One Way or Another

252
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,000
but how does that translate across the

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,940
organization how does that go up at this

254
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,640
time I was in Autodesk an Autodesk had

255
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,600
250 products One Security team

256
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
how do you scale that stress modeling so

257
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
at that time we had already some numbers

258
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
of applying continuous threat modeling

259
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,040
to those those teams and we were able to

260
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
come in present those those numbers show

261
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260
where the whole idea fell things that

262
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,360
broke and how we fixed it or how we try

263
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,959
to fix it

264
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,300
shortly after that that again with the

265
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,579
great mad cause and uh and me at Defcon

266
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,720
we decided to look a bit less on the

267
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,459
thread side of things and more on the

268
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,420
modeling

269
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,600
why is it the teams sometimes say I

270
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,820
don't want to do a data flow diagram I

271
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,079
don't want to do a sequence diagram

272
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
those things are hard these things take

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,560
time so what is so bad about modeling a

274
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
system especially when the system

275
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,800
already exists

276
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,079
that's another barrier of Entry to

277
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,140
threat modeling that we looked at

278
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,920
and just a month or two ago

279
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,500
the open security Summit I put forward

280
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,060
this question to a number of people

281
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,680
attending

282
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,420
how is it that you fail a threat model

283
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,940
what causes your threat model to fail

284
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,860
right two different questions but

285
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,480
interesting answers

286
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,339
and then I put everything together and

287
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,899
that's what I'm bringing to you guys

288
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,480
today now each one of these is on

289
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
YouTube feel free to take a look if

290
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
you're interested

291
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,279
so back to the thing we know that right

292
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,959
models are good

293
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,640
in my opinion first of all because they

294
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,240
give you Clarity especially today

295
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,880
uh I recently changed jobs

296
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,459
and as soon as I got to the new one I

297
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:52,079
asked okay how do things happen here

298
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,540
what's the big design what's how do

299
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,160
Parts come together

300
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,660
and somebody put in front of me a

301
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,620
diagram

302
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,360
and I looked at it and I saw that it was

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,339
good

304
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,860
in other places I did not have the same

305
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,139
experience I had people explaining to me

306
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,120
oh we can't really do a diagram because

307
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,160
you know there are some parts of it that

308
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
are a black box and the people who wrote

309
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,519
it are not here anymore and we try not

310
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,279
to touch it just in case it breaks so

311
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,260
not really a good idea right

312
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,500
but the practice of of creating a trust

313
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,060
model both the modeling and the threat

314
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,519
they help give you Clarity on top of

315
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,279
things how they work you have

316
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,160
defined deviations from design what uh I

317
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,260
call the Eureka moments that's the time

318
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,760
when the whole team is discussing the

319
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,360
the system and the Chief Architect is

320
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,279
going on and on and on about how good

321
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,260
how things are good

322
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,200
and then at the end of the the room some

323
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,899
got some guy throws his hand up and say

324
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,820
you know what that is the design but

325
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,100
because of the library ABC we had some

326
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,420
constraints and we had to change the

327
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,279
thing around and you know it's not like

328
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,480
that anymore

329
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
and all of a sudden boom Things become

330
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,200
clear and people notice that yeah we

331
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,240
have a problem here that we may need to

332
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
look at

333
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,019
the next thing is threat models help

334
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,079
with a bunch of stuff they help identify

335
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,000
and mitigate issues at design time

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
whatever design time may be

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,959
whenever it happens

338
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,700
they identify constraints that you have

339
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,440
around the development sometimes you can

340
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
use this technology you can't use that

341
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,100
one sometimes you can deploy here but

342
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
you can deploy there

343
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,220
threat models will help you figure that

344
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,420
out

345
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,380
they help in other categories they a

346
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,380
trust model won't give you just security

347
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,720
stuff it will tell you about resiliency

348
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,660
it will tell you about uh testing about

349
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,440
monitoring things that are related in

350
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
parallel to security

351
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,639
but that can benefit from the

352
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,779
information that comes from a good

353
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:57,060
threat model

354
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,600
and you know when we talk about these

355
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,320
devsecops thing

356
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,000
if you want everybody talking one

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,260
language if you want everybody looking

358
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,120
at the same thing having a threat model

359
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,339
is a great same thing for everybody to

360
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,240
look at

361
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,760
because it explains what your system is

362
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,980
how it was built the things that you

363
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,620
wonder about is this going to be working

364
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,519
tomorrow

365
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,500
and really focus everybody around the

366
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,139
same campfire so to say everybody's

367
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,339
speaking the same language because they

368
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,420
are looking at the same thing in the

369
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,040
middle

370
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,220
now perspectives on threat models we

371
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,500
have first of all

372
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,500
us security practitioners we know what

373
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,860
we're doing we like trust models and we

374
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,180
can turn to something like the threat

375
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,720
modeling Manifesto and even see a

376
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,180
definition that we all can come together

377
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
behind

378
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,139
uh it's analyzing representations of a

379
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,760
system to highlight concerns about

380
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,779
security and privacy characteristics

381
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,540
the words are big the idea very simple

382
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,360
we are all looking at the same thing we

383
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,860
are thinking about security we are

384
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,260
talking thinking about privacy and we

385
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,660
are trying to Bubble Up issues that may

386
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,519
touch those two things

387
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,139
now

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,820
together with that the threat modeling

389
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,620
Manifesto adopted if you guys haven't

390
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,980
seen it yet I heartily recommend uh the

391
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,680
chat model Manifesto adopted what has

392
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
been known forever as the four questions

393
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,579
by Adam shostak

394
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,060
now one of the things that every single

395
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,800
time that I look at this for

396
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
questions

397
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,320
jumps to me is how Adam managed to get

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,540
something that we can talk about hours

399
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,720
and hours and hours write books

400
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,940
presentations what not

401
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,440
and bringing it down to four lines of

402
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,959
short text that basically explain the

403
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,000
whole thing

404
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,100
what are we working on what's this thing

405
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,360
that we're building

406
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,940
what can go wrong what are we going to

407
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,980
do about it and did we do a good enough

408
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,860
job we answered this four we have a

409
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,599
threat model and a good one probably

410
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,699
now this is how it looks for us it's

411
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,339
simple it's good gives results yay let's

412
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,099
go let's do it how does it look

413
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,819
for them

414
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,260
it looks like work

415
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,260
it looks like unclear work

416
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,880
it looks like

417
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,059
stuff that's going to dilate the way

418
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,620
that they are doing things it looks like

419
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,140
one more thing that they have to do

420
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,940
before they can actually go and write

421
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,919
nice code that turns into nice web pages

422
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,360
that turns into a nice service and

423
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,020
everybody is happy

424
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,059
this is basically the thing that we have

425
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,880
to overcome when we are trying to sell

426
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,200
threat modeling as a practice

427
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,720
Okay so

428
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,419
two big questions on how we fail on this

429
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,179
we can fail to threat model and our

430
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,039
transform threat models themselves once

431
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,260
done can fail let's try and answer the

432
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,380
first one how do we fail to threat model

433
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,120
people come to you and say hey this

434
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,520
thing is too costly

435
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,919
it's taking time other people the time

436
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,120
costs money

437
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,000
it's too long forget the money it's just

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,340
taking too long the system is developing

439
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,260
and the threat model is developing and

440
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,299
each one of them developing either in a

441
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,799
different direction or at different

442
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,720
speeds

443
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
it is too difficult we have to bring

444
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,520
Consultants to do this thing and the

445
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
Consultants don't know the system

446
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,140
or we have this tool that does it but

447
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,240
the tool Works in a certain way and we

448
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,740
have to learn the tool and we have to

449
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,539
learn the way that the tool works and we

450
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,860
have to adapt everything it's too

451
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,500
difficult there's too much process

452
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,840
it is too conceptual you're asking me to

453
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,580
look at a design and imagine oh my God

454
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,919
what could possibly go wrong

455
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,200
I write lines of code I don't want to

456
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,940
think about this conceptual stuff

457
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,380
it is to security

458
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,360
right you need somebody who actually

459
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,100
knows security to talk about security

460
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,720
because if they don't security then

461
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,700
security doesn't security the secure

462
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,799
thing that is insecure because it has

463
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,000
not secure

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,419
right

465
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,780
or

466
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,720
management simply doesn't see the value

467
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,980
if you're telling me that you're going

468
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,600
to get my whole development team put

469
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,480
them aside for a non-negligible amount

470
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,460
of time it's going to cost me a

471
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,620
non-edgable amount of money and what's

472
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,559
going to come out of it more work so

473
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,700
what have we achieved

474
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,639
engineering

475
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,039
true and that's a great solution and in

476
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,480
fact I think that it's an approximation

477
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,880
of what Microsoft said to do with their

478
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,340
normal Loop when they said hey the agile

479
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,320
way of doing this thing is to get once

480
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,020
one Sprint ever ever so often and do it

481
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,900
a threat modeling Sprint right so it's a

482
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,400
bit more of an approximation of that and

483
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,940
it's an almost end step towards threat

484
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,740
model every story

485
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,200
so yeah I would totally go there with

486
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,380
you

487
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,820
yep true

488
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,620
so back to the list and thank you for

489
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,960
the question uh

490
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,179
engineering doesn't see the value and

491
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,940
that happens more times than you could

492
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,100
imagine they will go through the motions

493
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,140
they will do everything that security

494
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,700
asks them to do

495
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,440
and at the end of the process they'll

496
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,760
look back at you and say why did I do

497
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,799
this I already knew all this stuff you

498
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,000
didn't add anything in there

499
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,960
many times they'll come to you and say

500
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,520
hey we already scanner called and we

501
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,020
already pen test

502
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,460
and we already do all these other

503
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,679
automatic things why do I need one more

504
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,440
security thing

505
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,820
I think that by now all of you already

506
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,220
know the answer

507
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,860
and include reason age everybody has

508
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,659
their own

509
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,919
the point that I put it in there is that

510
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,500
frankly and and I know that I am

511
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,539
extremely biased to say this

512
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,539
I have not yet heard

513
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,020
one reason why it shouldn't be done

514
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,760
I heard many reasons why it should be

515
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,140
done differently

516
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,280
totally

517
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,799
and that's part of of the stock

518
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,320
but I have not heard one single reason

519
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,260
why threat modeling should not be taken

520
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,980
as a practice

521
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,600
so let's say that they agreed and they

522
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,539
did a threat model yay now how does a

523
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:12,059
threat model by itself once done or once

524
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,460
in doing fails

525
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,559
if they do not bring value

526
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,320
the threat modeling Manifesto approaches

527
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,980
that in two lines they do not lead to

528
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,720
Improvement in the security posture

529
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,280
meaning yeah you went through the

530
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,320
motions you did the whole thing but now

531
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,539
you are not in a better place that you

532
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:32,340
were before you don't know more stuff

533
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,559
about your security than you did before

534
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,280
so basically you forgot to bring value

535
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,820
and you enter the anti-pattern of the

536
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,919
hero threat modeler instead of taking

537
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,360
your whole team

538
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,700
and getting all of them involved in the

539
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,799
process of threat modeling what you did

540
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,559
was you called Joe and said Joe you are

541
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,720
my senior developer here you know where

542
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,700
all the skeletons are buried why don't

543
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,860
you go for a week and come back with a

544
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,260
threat Molly it's the the Moses in the

545
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,400
mountain thing

546
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,500
he went out he took everything he knew

547
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,960
about the system he brought it back

548
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,179
and you know what that's a short model

549
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,000
of a system as seen by one person

550
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,460
and if anybody in here is familiar with

551
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,820
the uh parable of the elephant and the

552
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,320
Three Blind Men I'm not going to go into

553
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,260
details but what they expressed is what

554
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,299
they see in there it does not mean that

555
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,039
it's the total of the system

556
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,020
admiration for the problem

557
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,520
meaning somebody

558
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,280
got that task or a team got a task of

559
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,860
that trust model and they kept staring

560
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,500
at it and staring at it and

561
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,080
being so engrossed by how we do the

562
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
staying how do we start how we don't and

563
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,980
we know that we finished how do we know

564
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,200
that it was good that they end up with

565
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,520
something that's

566
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,539
is more of a we really really tried than

567
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:57,620
an actual threat model

568
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,140
a failing threat model does not express

569
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,960
threats at all so they come back to you

570
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,480
and say we are perfect we own the stain

571
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,179
it's all good it's not going to break

572
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,539
best system ever uh doesn't happen so if

573
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,740
that's the answer that you got somebody

574
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,480
forgot something

575
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,159
or they do not express the right threats

576
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,480
which the threat model the manifesto

577
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,659
refers to as a tendency to over Focus

578
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,380
you get the latest shiniest thing that

579
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,520
came out of

580
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,620
wherever it is

581
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,799
I re if you guys remember there was a

582
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,260
a time where everybody was looking for

583
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,179
side Channel attacks and stuff like that

584
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,220
why because it was the sexiest kind of

585
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,600
attack that you could

586
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,700
meanwhile you're not looking for xss

587
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,380
you're not looking for

588
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,900
sea surf a lot of other stuff that you

589
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,640
know probably is going to be attacked

590
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,580
before that other thing happens so you

591
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,500
tend to over focus into something that's

592
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,720
probably not relevant to you or less

593
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,520
relevant to you and you forget to look

594
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,400
at the whole other 80 90 percent of

595
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,580
stuff that is relevant to you

596
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,919
if you have a threat model that does not

597
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
represent the system and that goes

598
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,900
together with the hero threat modeler

599
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,799
which is it's one person's view of the

600
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,780
system not everybody's

601
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,640
or you fall into the perfect

602
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
representation anti-pattern there is no

603
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240
perfect presentation of a system

604
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,400
especially a living one

605
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,500
oh but wait my system has been in place

606
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,659
for 20 years and nobody touches it what

607
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,640
happens there must be a perfect

608
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,860
representation there's a very close

609
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,320
perfect representation but the things

610
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
around your system I'm willing to bet

611
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,260
keep changing where it's deployed who is

612
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,480
it talking to what kind of data is going

613
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,919
into it

614
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,980
old libraries that have new findings

615
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,700
so yeah as much as that thing is like

616
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,279
Frozen in Time things that are related

617
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,140
to it keep changing and you have to go

618
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,520
together with that you have to keep

619
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,200
changing the way that your models are

620
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,200
represented to go together with changes

621
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,860
in time

622
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,400
and dead threat models

623
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,440
these are usually

624
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,779
triggered by

625
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,919
governance efforts there is a box

626
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,860
somewhere in a form saying you have to

627
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,140
have a threat model before you you go

628
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,140
out and somebody goes and writes a

629
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,240
pretty document and call call it a

630
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,179
threat model checks the Box the document

631
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,220
goes into a

632
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,240
a desk jar and only turns up next time

633
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,279
that they have to do another one because

634
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,260
they are deploying again

635
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,820
so

636
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,799
that to me is the saddest one because

637
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,080
people put put effort to put time and

638
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,120
money in there and did not get

639
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,640
absolutely any value of it apart from

640
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,620
that check in the checkbox

641
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,559
oh and the last one of course your

642
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,860
threat model is not my threat model

643
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,140
a sentence that a lot of people like to

644
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,779
use in very different contexts and many

645
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,419
times two people were saying the same

646
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,760
thing but not meaning exactly the same

647
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,700
thing but the fact is that sometimes and

648
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,919
this is something that I see a lot

649
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,559
people will say hey I was asked to

650
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,360
create a threat model for my system

651
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,720
can I look at yours

652
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,400
yeah you can sure

653
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,440
you can be educated by it you can learn

654
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,080
about my system by it but that's not

655
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,120
going to be your short model you're not

656
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,059
just going to change the name on the top

657
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,559
and automatically that's going to become

658
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,360
your threat model a threat model is

659
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,679
something that's extremely focused on

660
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,419
whatever it is that we are building

661
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,100
if you refer back to the four questions

662
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,559
right so to just go ahead and get

663
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,240
something that remotely looks like and

664
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,580
say oh that's mine I'll just change the

665
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,100
name of the boxes a couple of data flows

666
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,779
and everything is good

667
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,419
probably not so make sure that your

668
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,360
thread model is your thread model

669
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
so what is the problem that we are

670
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,919
trying to solve here today what's the

671
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,539
thing that I'm trying to bring to you

672
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,360
guys now that we know how threat models

673
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,100
fail and now that we know how we can

674
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,120
fail to track more

675
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,980
and is organizations teams and even

676
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,200
developers that don't want to threat

677
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,159
model

678
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,200
now I put the want in

679
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,659
big letters there just because it

680
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,480
strikes like stronger but the fact is

681
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
that there are some who can't do it as

682
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,299
well

683
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,760
now uh this URL here

684
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,880
is an attempt of mine to get out of the

685
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,279
uh writing to security people and

686
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,860
instead write to Developers this site

687
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,720
here leaddav.com if you don't know it

688
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,539
awesome site seriously they have amazing

689
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,980
stuff there but it's more about

690
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,380
engineering than security they do have

691
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,720
security content but it's more like this

692
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,640
and

693
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,760
in this blog I I try to write a bit

694
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,039
about my experience as a security

695
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,620
partitioner as a security consultant as

696
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,880
a security

697
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
big quotes Champion for teams and what I

698
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,000
experienced trying to move them along uh

699
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,799
their security Journey

700
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,899
and uh

701
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,760
in there I just put it out you know this

702
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,559
thing is like selling Insurance nobody

703
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,299
wants to buy nobody wants to pay the

704
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,159
costs but as soon as something happens

705
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,179
they do want to get the good part of it

706
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,039
and

707
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,840
by adopting the perspectives of the

708
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
decision makers we can grasp how they're

709
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,220
likely to perceive or plan an attempts

710
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,279
at persuasion meaning

711
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,320
if you want to convince something to do

712
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,460
something that they are really really

713
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,399
against doing because of any of those

714
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,740
reasons that we we went through

715
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,480
the first step to actually changing

716
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,940
their minds is not creating a better

717
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,760
argument because they are set where they

718
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,659
are

719
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,059
in my opinion the first step is to put

720
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:08,820
yourself in their place why is it that

721
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,080
they are feeling it

722
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,000
why is it that they aren't that they

723
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,260
think that they are under these

724
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,600
constraints if they really are under

725
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,120
these constraints what can I do to help

726
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,100
them move away from them do I have to go

727
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,919
one level up do I have to show a

728
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,539
different way of engaging the whole

729
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,720
thing

730
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,059
and that's called perspective taking

731
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:33,779
I am very lucky to be married to a

732
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,720
professor in a business

733
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,059
and uh she pointed me towards

734
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,679
perspective taking when I started

735
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,480
telling her

736
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
what is it that I'm doing with people

737
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,620
that I have to convince and what kind of

738
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,600
argument I'm bringing to the table and

739
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,919
she said oh you know what that actually

740
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,720
has a name and if you go and get

741
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,100
informed and learn a bit more about it

742
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,659
you're probably going to be a bit more

743
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,640
effective on it and

744
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,120
amazingly as wives do if she was right

745
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,860
so

746
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,020
once I tried to apply perspective taking

747
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,659
to my security practice what was it that

748
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,100
I figured out

749
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,799
the first step was to tailor the pitch

750
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,620
which is marketing 101 right you want to

751
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,360
convince someone you want to start

752
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,059
talking in the language that they

753
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,340
want to to hear that they they are used

754
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,840
to to here

755
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,059
so you avoid Doom and Gloom

756
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,740
you don't go and you say oh my God if

757
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,419
you don't have a church model horrible

758
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,039
things are going to happen the company

759
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,080
is going to fail the stock is going to

760
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,580
tank

761
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,299
and uh you have to have one right you

762
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,679
run away from that it just puts people

763
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,600
on the defensive you don't want to to

764
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,460
deal with that

765
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,140
you show them that there are some things

766
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,640
that come together

767
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,620
with this goodness that the threat model

768
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,140
brings to security

769
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,080
which again is the clarity is the

770
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,179
inclusion is getting everybody's voice

771
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,460
represented in what the system is what

772
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,080
it does and what are the bad things that

773
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
could happen to it

774
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,039
so in terms of the the

775
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:07,080
the team around the system

776
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,360
you get good things out of doing it

777
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,059
another thing on that note uh Brooke

778
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,520
schreinfeld another person in threat

779
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,080
modeling that you guys should know by

780
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,919
now if not go do it he says that uh one

781
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,720
of the worst experiences that he has is

782
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,000
when people when he goes to try to model

783
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,679
something and people think that he are

784
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,640
that he is criticizing the design

785
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,440
and

786
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
I believe that in conversation we came

787
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,039
up with this thing that you have to make

788
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,779
it very clear to them that you are not

789
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,399
going to criticize the design you are

790
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,080
going to help them make that design

791
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,179
whatever it is whatever your opinion of

792
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,140
it is

793
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,260
more resilient more secure

794
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,240
so basically you're not criticizing the

795
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,460
design you're just saying hey this thing

796
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,799
here could be made different and it

797
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,179
would be so much better for everybody

798
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,100
then you have to translate into what

799
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,320
they have to gain apart from security

800
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,500
which again goes to the resiliency to

801
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,840
the monitoring to the auditing stuff

802
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,539
that is again ancillary and connected to

803
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,399
security but it's not security per se

804
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,140
it's not

805
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,559
I'm saving you from cross-site scripting

806
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,480
it's I'm giving you a framework that you

807
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,360
can use to make other efforts around the

808
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,260
system better

809
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,279
clarify to them that threat modeling is

810
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,440
an evolutionary activity many times

811
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,419
people are afraid of stress modeling

812
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:38,000
because they say what if I get it wrong

813
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,059
am I actually writing a contract saying

814
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,700
my security is good apart from these

815
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,500
things which I'm I'm going to mitigate

816
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,260
when I can and these are the problems

817
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,600
that I have identified what if I forgot

818
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,340
a big problem

819
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,200
what is this going to say about me what

820
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,519
is going to say about the product what

821
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,220
it's going to say about the team

822
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,260
by telling them Hey listen this is an

823
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,519
evolution thing right today you don't

824
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,559
have a threat model

825
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,380
do one it's going to be a bad one it's

826
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,659
already better than not having one

827
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,099
you're going to learn things from it

828
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:12,418
you're going to learn things about your

829
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,440
system you're going to learn things

830
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,820
about threat modeling you're going to

831
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,280
learn things about threading threats

832
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,139
just go ahead do it

833
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,080
tomorrow you do it better

834
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,179
so explain to them that it's it's a

835
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,580
moving Target it's not a point in time

836
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,760
thing that you are basically taking a a

837
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,099
stand and saying this is the security

838
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,980
status of my thing and nothing Beyond

839
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,940
this is going to ever happen

840
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,639
yep that too okay oh me

841
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,580
later

842
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,820
the second step is to manage both sides

843
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,159
of the conversation

844
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,540
so

845
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,460
this is the tricky part because it's

846
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,680
hard we we are security people we are

847
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,839
opinionated we've been doing things a

848
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,540
certain way for a certain time we have

849
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,220
very clear opinions about what's good

850
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,500
what's bad what's in between

851
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,980
and now I'm telling you forget all that

852
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,260
put yourself into their place

853
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,000
consider the things that you are asking

854
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,859
them to do and how much it's going to

855
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,920
ask them to to cost them to actually do

856
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,060
it

857
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,140
okay

858
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,720
that's going to help you tailor your

859
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,359
message in terms of that cost and in

860
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,980
terms of the effort that you're asking

861
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,820
them

862
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,480
to make

863
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,280
and how to get closer to them in that

864
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,640
discussion find that that middle

865
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,980
middle space that middle point where

866
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,160
perhaps you can't really agree but it's

867
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,560
very hard to disagree because you ask

868
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,640
for something you gave something

869
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,339
ask yourself if you're suggesting all

870
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:00,060
threats and mitigations or the right

871
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,760
threats and mitigations and what I mean

872
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,099
by that is and some people are going to

873
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,500
take this the wrong way I'm sure but

874
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,020
it's the reality of the thing there is

875
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,220
such a thing as too much security

876
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,220
not everything is Fort Knox

877
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,680
okay you don't have to defend everything

878
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,800
like the crown jewels

879
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,079
sometimes you can be down here and

880
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,599
that's enough so recognize that and

881
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,460
whenever you're tailoring the pitch make

882
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,560
sure that you are selling the right size

883
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,200
of security and not the most absolute

884
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,118
security thing that you can ever imagine

885
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:41,040
suggesting Solutions rather than giving

886
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,619
instructions

887
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,520
again you're taking their perspective

888
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,760
they are going to be and by day I'm

889
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,700
using a very very generic developer

890
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,119
archetype to talk okay

891
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,020
people usually are less responsive to

892
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,300
someone telling them this is how you're

893
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,619
going to do it

894
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:06,960
because there is a

895
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,119
an understanding of this is how you're

896
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,740
going to do it because I know better

897
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,140
than you and I don't know if you guys

898
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,300
ever saw a developer they don't like

899
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,880
that kind of thing all right

900
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
so

901
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,200
tell them hey here's a suggestion

902
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,060
this is how you could do this in a

903
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,800
secure way

904
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,800
can you find the way to make that fit

905
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,960
your view of the world your model of the

906
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,280
system

907
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,380
so

908
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,260
telling them I've seen this work in a

909
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,540
different place it was very similar to

910
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,640
yours it's not exactly the same one so

911
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,500
you're going to have to do some thinking

912
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,599
you're going to to have to adapt this to

913
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,220
your reality

914
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,099
but here's something that I saw working

915
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,619
that gives them just the right amount of

916
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,020
information for them to start their own

917
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,020
journey into what is their solution

918
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,260
you also get ownership out of it

919
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,900
it's not oh that thing broke the

920
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,180
security guy told me to do it it's like

921
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,880
oh that thing worked yeah because I got

922
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,619
to think that the security guy said and

923
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:11,520
uh

924
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,619
hey it works

925
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,000
fun for the whole family right

926
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,420
and at the end finding the right time to

927
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,599
push

928
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,300
Hint it is not when everybody is running

929
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,800
around because the system doesn't work

930
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,859
for some completely unrelated reason

931
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,220
it is not two weeks before deployment

932
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,680
it is definitely not during heck week

933
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,599
when everybody's trying to do their Pet

934
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
Project

935
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,980
finding the right time to push is one of

936
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,000
those things that's going to be

937
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,520
extremely dependent of the organization

938
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,220
itself of the timing of the project

939
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,599
even

940
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,960
The Temper of the people involved right

941
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,900
they they will have their own Rhythm and

942
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,579
you're going to have to identify that

943
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,339
Rhythm and insert yourself into it so

944
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,200
find the right time to come in and put

945
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,980
your thing on a table

946
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,099
but okay so I talked a lot and I moved

947
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,040
my hands around a lot but what am I

948
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,820
actually telling you guys worked for me

949
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,619
I was in an organization

950
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,960
I tried everything I could some things

951
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,440
that I even don't agree with

952
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,240
there was no threat modeling being done

953
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,220
so first thing that I did was

954
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,140
that I tried to meet them where they

955
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,839
actually are and not where I want them

956
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:37,920
to be

957
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,079
I completely stopped the thing of guys

958
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,140
you have to trust model no

959
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,820
guys it's okay you're doing your thing

960
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,460
awesome let's go there let's see what we

961
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,180
can take out of it

962
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,280
every organization has some kind of

963
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,440
document an RFC uh design document on

964
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Architectural Review whatever that

965
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,900
basically

966
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,579
basically uh defines what is it that's

967
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,200
going to be built or what's already

968
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,160
being built and basically where the the

969
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,200
discussions happen where people comment

970
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,060
on the document or they have a meeting

971
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,619
and stuff

972
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,839
if the organization that you don't that

973
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,300
you are don't have that

974
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,540
there are many who are hiring so

975
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,040
you have other problems than threat

976
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,900
modeling but most of them do have

977
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,099
something like this

978
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,540
make use of that thing two

979
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,980
add the template

980
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,859
with a very simple question what could

981
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:41,598
possibly go wrong

982
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,540
no it's a very simple question

983
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,640
but if you notice even that simple

984
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,760
question in the way that you ask it

985
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,760
and I'm talking the the tone that you

986
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,660
use

987
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,900
has a very different meaning

988
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,720
a security person will look at a design

989
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,959
and usually in a very um

990
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,660
almost cynical tone of voice what could

991
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,119
possibly go wrong oh yeah did these guys

992
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,800
even know what they're doing

993
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,180
on the other hand the developer will

994
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,160
look at the same design and say

995
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,900
what could possibly go wrong it's the

996
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,599
simplest thing ever right there's

997
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,760
nothing here that can break these are

998
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,140
parts that talk to each other and things

999
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,480
happen and it's a good product what

1000
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,400
could possibly go wrong

1001
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,440
so when you ask that question

1002
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,540
keep in mind it's you as a security

1003
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,280
person asking but it's them as

1004
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,020
developers answering

1005
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,480
so make sure that when you read those

1006
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,099
answers you are reading with the right

1007
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:42,599
approach

1008
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,640
your reading with the approach of

1009
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,220
someone seeing somebody say

1010
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,020
I don't know what could go wrong I don't

1011
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,220
think there's anything that could

1012
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,980
do not overload the question with your

1013
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,280
eyes references checklists whatever why

1014
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,800
because now you're taking the focus away

1015
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,839
you're taking the focus from that simple

1016
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,599
line what could possibly go wrong and

1017
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,240
you are giving them a library of stuff

1018
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,180
to look and be overwhelmed by

1019
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,579
if you can't if they are

1020
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,040
going against what you want in terms of

1021
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,460
I can't do that do not overload them

1022
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,800
but would you prompt that question

1023
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,020
anyway like look at a few Dimensions

1024
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,220
like data surface

1025
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,660
you know things that are important in

1026
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,460
your organizational context

1027
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,180
okay

1028
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,260
so

1029
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,020
let's jump the one with the uh someone

1030
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,579
of security background in there for a

1031
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,880
second and let's go to your question

1032
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,599
uh if nobody beats okay nobody came and

1033
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,800
said yeah there's something that could

1034
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,960
could go wrong or we looked at these

1035
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,940
things and they look fine for us then

1036
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,339
start seeding it start asking the

1037
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,380
questions yourself start going a bit

1038
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,800
deeper but again no checklists no URI

1039
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,780
nothing hey have you guys looked at the

1040
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,339
authentication of this thing have you

1041
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,920
imagined what could happen if server a

1042
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,060
went down

1043
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,560
guys have you looked at the

1044
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,720
identification of this object is that

1045
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,099
something that you could guess is that

1046
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,599
something and if somebody guesses it

1047
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,560
what happens

1048
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,020
what happens if I guess the identifier

1049
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,180
of that that call

1050
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,119
uh guys do we really need to ask for

1051
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,920
this kind of information do we need to

1052
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,940
store it

1053
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,500
so on so forth

1054
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,240
so you're giving very

1055
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,000
simple prompts to start a conversation

1056
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,420
that's your your final

1057
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,160
objective you want to start that

1058
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,839
conversation

1059
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,780
when that happens by the nature of the

1060
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,099
work by the nature of the people that

1061
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,500
they are developers will notice hey I

1062
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,839
don't know enough about this stuff to be

1063
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,760
to be able to answer that

1064
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,859
and that will get them to start their

1065
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:53,760
Journey

1066
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,000
so leave them there push gently

1067
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,400
and look for the results

1068
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,140
the previous bullet make sure that there

1069
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,220
is someone with security background

1070
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,339
around is it a must no if you can have

1071
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:07,578
it

1072
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,599
if you can have someone in there who's

1073
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,520
going to hey you know what I know a bit

1074
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,079
about this stuff so yeah why don't we

1075
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,839
look at it in a certain way

1076
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,480
uh and remember the final point of the

1077
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,420
exercise is not to provide answers but

1078
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,940
to elicit questions

1079
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,140
it is harder to start people asking

1080
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,240
than for them to give you answers think

1081
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,460
about that for a second

1082
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,859
if you ask a developer a question they

1083
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,380
will have an answer

1084
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,819
but if they don't know even the

1085
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,460
questions that they need to to be asked

1086
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,540
then you have a bigger problem

1087
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,000
finally you have a place where people

1088
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,359
can come and build on those questions if

1089
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,800
you have a slack Channel where security

1090
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,560
people can hang out and answer stuff if

1091
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,440
you have open hours if you have your

1092
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,200
personal email okay tell them hey you

1093
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,119
know what if you think about this stuff

1094
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,819
and something comes up drop me an email

1095
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:08,280
I'll answer right make yourself

1096
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,720
available

1097
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,780
and make them welcome don't make them

1098
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,060
feel like they are going to someone who

1099
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,680
is a guru sitting on top of a mountain

1100
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,740
just waiting for the masses to come with

1101
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,960
their questions make them feel welcome

1102
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,280
make yourself available

1103
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,099
this is an example of one that I used uh

1104
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,079
recently

1105
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,599
this thing was there in the middle of uh

1106
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,619
an RFC now I'm going to be extremely uh

1107
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,780
honest with you what I'm not showing is

1108
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,079
the last line that did have a bunch of

1109
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,400
Uris but pointers pointer to books to

1110
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,339
whatever I remove that stuff

1111
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:53,579
because I learned that it's not useful

1112
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,380
people would come to me and say hey I

1113
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,760
started looking at that stuff and all of

1114
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,500
a sudden three hours passed and I hadn't

1115
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,420
answered one single question I did not

1116
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,940
know one new thing to ask and my other

1117
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,400
work did not get done so I'm sorry this

1118
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,500
thing is too time consuming

1119
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,640
that's when I learned that no

1120
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,700
overloading that stuff not a good idea

1121
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,300
and it happened more than once

1122
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,180
now as we get to the end here

1123
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,819
I want to start living with

1124
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,760
one big big big big big big big big idea

1125
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
which is emergence versus emergency

1126
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,680
the emergency here is I did not think of

1127
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,119
all the things that could go wrong one

1128
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,160
of them surfaced bit me

1129
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,280
now I'm running around my head on fire

1130
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,839
nothing's working people are screaming

1131
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,640
at me what do I do

1132
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,020
the other one is actually

1133
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,480
emergence

1134
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,260
just by asking that one simple question

1135
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,220
one of the four of Adam's questions

1136
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,380
repeatedly at different levels at

1137
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,480
different times

1138
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,280
first you are going to be known as a

1139
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,079
very very boring person because you keep

1140
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,720
asking the same question but over time

1141
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,520
you are going to improve the way that

1142
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,740
people think about their systems you are

1143
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,300
going to improve the questions that they

1144
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,800
ask you are going to improve the answers

1145
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,079
that they give

1146
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,180
how you win how do you know that you did

1147
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,099
something right and yes something better

1148
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:21,780
is happening first of all people are

1149
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,599
going to ask unpromptu questions

1150
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,339
you're you're not going to have to prod

1151
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,319
people somebody is going to come out of

1152
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,900
the dark out of the blue and say hey I

1153
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,579
was thinking about this thing uh do you

1154
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:33,780
think they did something that could go

1155
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,740
wrong

1156
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,839
smile to yourself two thumbs up you want

1157
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,819
the questions happening during one part

1158
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:43,560
of the discussion and we're discussing

1159
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,900
this part of the system here all of a

1160
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,760
sudden somebody is going to say hey but

1161
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,339
wait doesn't that apply to this part of

1162
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,319
the system here

1163
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,060
you got people to understand the

1164
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,619
question and the answer you've won

1165
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,319
people start asking how can I ask better

1166
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,540
questions

1167
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,880
people are going to start asking where

1168
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,480
can I find security training

1169
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,520
they'll ask where is the threat model

1170
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,619
for x

1171
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,200
not because they want to copy it

1172
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,940
not because they want that to be their

1173
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,020
threat model

1174
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,819
but because because they want

1175
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,560
information that's in there

1176
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,839
that's going to inform their threat

1177
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,020
model

1178
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,520
there's going to be complaints that

1179
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,839
there's too much information being

1180
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,420
generated and that nobody knows how to

1181
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,160
capture that stuff that's when you

1182
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,260
really really want

1183
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,240
because that's the point in the life of

1184
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,339
that organization that they are asking

1185
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,560
you to create a repository of trust

1186
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,200
models a template that people will use

1187
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,760
to put all that information that's being

1188
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,859
generated

1189
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,599
and then all the other questions get

1190
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,700
answered by having that people will be

1191
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,740
able to search that repository people

1192
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,599
will be able to find information people

1193
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,240
will be able to say hey somebody has not

1194
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,700
touched this threat model in two weeks

1195
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,700
and the system has completely refreshed

1196
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,099
somebody has to look at this

1197
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:09,660
that's when you really know that you

1198
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,339
want

1199
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,079
takeaways

1200
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,520
I love this picture

1201
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,160
first of all I did it and second uh

1202
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,020
because I really consider the threat

1203
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,800
model

1204
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,099
is a hanger for many of the other

1205
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,339
activities in the ssdlc you want to

1206
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,040
inform your secure design of course you

1207
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,740
need a threat model you want to look at

1208
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,420
your implementation in more detail

1209
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,740
understand how that system actually

1210
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,660
works your address model is there for

1211
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,319
you

1212
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,660
you want to do better security testing

1213
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,160
hey what are the things that I

1214
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,160
identified as possible threats to my

1215
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,079
to my system

1216
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,940
those are probably good things to start

1217
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,619
testing

1218
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,180
you want to check your deployment you

1219
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,740
want to talk to devops people and say

1220
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,420
hey this is how I need this thing this

1221
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,339
thing to be deployed these are the

1222
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:58,260
permissions these are the resources so

1223
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,000
on and so forth your chart model is

1224
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,720
there to inform you

1225
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,420
can make it work

1226
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,800
like everything in life it's going to

1227
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,160
take effort

1228
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,240
it's all about understanding your

1229
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,220
customer and many times it is about

1230
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,660
understanding who your customer is

1231
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,460
sometimes you think that it's the

1232
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,280
developer many times it isn't so you

1233
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,660
have to read that situation you have to

1234
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,920
figure out who is it that you are there

1235
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,319
to serve

1236
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:26,940
when I'm happy

1237
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,680
you can't force people to threat model

1238
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,780
but you can't show them that they are

1239
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,400
already doing it without knowing

1240
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,640
Again The evolutionary thing set your

1241
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,800
expectations let people know you don't

1242
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,480
expect perfect Perfection right away

1243
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,700
it's going to take time it's a process

1244
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,500
it's going to take learning

1245
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,940
but you will get better at it

1246
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:52,200
bad threat model is better than no

1247
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,359
threat model at all

1248
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:57,619
many different reasons

1249
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,599
don't get hang up in the process as

1250
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,000
somebody who has published a methodology

1251
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,400
I'm going to go go forward and tell you

1252
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,800
read it

1253
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,800
be informed by it

1254
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,540
don't be

1255
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:15,119
constrained by it

1256
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,740
read about the different methodologies

1257
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,599
and God there's a lot of different

1258
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,520
methodologies out there

1259
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,680
find the beats and pieces that work for

1260
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,140
you in your organization

1261
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,819
develop your own

1262
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:29,339
find the thing that works for you

1263
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,200
sounds complex

1264
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,819
not really

1265
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:35,160
if I if I can do it anybody can do it

1266
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,839
but to do take that time as

1267
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,760
practitioners find a way that threat

1268
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,619
modeling works for you and understand

1269
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,079
every time that you change organizations

1270
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,900
development teams whatever Frameworks

1271
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,540
you will probably have to adapt that way

1272
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,579
that it works for you so find your own

1273
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,260
style find your own methodology use it

1274
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:58,260
don't threat modeling into a verb

1275
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,260
don't say give me a threat model say hey

1276
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,079
let's try to model this thing

1277
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,780
it's a difference in approach that takes

1278
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,040
something

1279
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,480
absolute

1280
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,760
a package called a threat model

1281
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,619
and you just made it

1282
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:17,040
something that happens in a continuum

1283
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,900
let's iterate over this thing and come

1284
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,220
out

1285
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,680
with a list of findings let's threat

1286
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,859
model

1287
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,480
and simple questions can lead to complex

1288
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,960
answers and are easy to ask what can

1289
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,740
possibly go wrong

1290
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,740
Foster and model curiosity

1291
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,720
don't let people say oh that's not

1292
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,119
interesting if your security funny bone

1293
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,400
is tingling if you're Spider-Man saying

1294
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,260
suingly there's probably probably

1295
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,300
something interesting in there

1296
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,420
so keep people curious that's going to

1297
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,160
lead them

1298
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,760
and by itself be a ah

1299
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,579
an end game to the process of discovery

1300
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,220
thank you very much a couple of uh

1301
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,500
resources we have the threat modeling

1302
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,660
Manifesto

1303
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,960
we have mats and in mind book

1304
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
there is one by Brooke that I think that

1305
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,720
it's it's really mandatory that security

1306
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,740
securing systems applied security

1307
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,500
architecture and threat models

1308
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,599
we have the one that started it all with

1309
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,440
uh

1310
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,839
from Adam

1311
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,359
this one is a really good one because it

1312
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:33,960
covers the whole ssdlc in modern ways so

1313
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,180
it looks at the agile thing it looks how

1314
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,859
you can get those things up to the speed

1315
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:39,720
that you actually want to

1316
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,119
and here in the end we have secure by

1317
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,140
Design

1318
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,140
which is really really a good read on

1319
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,599
how to apply secure design patterns to

1320
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,540
your developer

1321
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,720
questions anything I believe I have six

1322
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,200
minutes more

1323
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,500
brilliant

1324
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:10,440
so here's the thing okay and

1325
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,200
let me

1326
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,619
prefixes by saying one thing

1327
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,540
I have huge respect

1328
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,220
for people who write

1329
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,500
threat modeling tools

1330
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,559
huge they are there helping popularize

1331
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,920
things make it accessible make it

1332
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,579
organized

1333
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,720
unfortunately

1334
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,180
the way the tools are today the states

1335
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,280
of the art where we are today

1336
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,880
to me it's like driving forward

1337
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,520
looking on the rear view mirror

1338
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,160
you have this set of rules this set of

1339
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,839
things and those are the ones that

1340
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,339
you're going to find

1341
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:53,220
so if you fixate on a two on the output

1342
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,380
that the tool is going to give you

1343
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,980
and consider that the whole thing

1344
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,480
you are missing a whole lot of what

1345
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,099
threat modeling can give you

1346
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,640
so I would say use the tool that best

1347
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,680
fits the way that you work

1348
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,700
don't let the tool tell you how to work

1349
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,859
but once you have the answer from that

1350
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,140
tool expand on it

1351
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,599
don't just print that report and again

1352
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,460
it's a dead threat model goes in the

1353
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,440
drawer that's it

1354
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,900
look beyond what the two is giving you

1355
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,420
many of the tools like many of the other

1356
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,859
security tools that we have seen along

1357
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,119
the years are going to give you false

1358
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,440
positives

1359
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,559
so learn to figure out those

1360
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,640
the

1361
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,800
Microsoft threat tools is a good example

1362
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,839
it's it's a great tool it's really

1363
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:41,460
something that I would give to somebody

1364
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,960
who's just beginning

1365
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,720
but it's going to give you 300 times the

1366
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,099
same thing just because you happen to

1367
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:48,359
have one data flow that doesn't have

1368
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:49,859
https

1369
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:51,359
Okay so

1370
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,119
no two today to my knowledge is able to

1371
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,800
give you the whole thing from A to B and

1372
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,720
remember threat modeling is a conceptual

1373
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,000
process

1374
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,559
so

1375
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,359
hard rules are not going to give you all

1376
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,259
the results that you want

1377
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,420
yes

1378
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,339
hmm

1379
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:13,260
nope

1380
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,540
oh sorry so

1381
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,059
um the main point about suggesting

1382
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:20,099
Solutions instead of picking

1383
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:22,740
instructions but when developers aren't

1384
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,300
Security Experts and not all Security

1385
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,000
Experts have been developers how do you

1386
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,140
actually ensure the correct

1387
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,740
implementation

1388
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,300
that's that's a great great question

1389
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,839
thank you

1390
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,540
security testing is the thing

1391
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,760
in many different forms

1392
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,440
so

1393
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,780
my personal approach is if I'm giving a

1394
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,079
suggestion I try to give that packaged

1395
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,900
if I'm telling you hey use Library XYZ

1396
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,579
to do

1397
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:57,240
I don't know output sanitization

1398
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,160
but then run the tasks with hey these

1399
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,960
payloads here and try to see what

1400
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,880
happens so verify that the library

1401
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,339
actually does what it says it does

1402
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,140
if I'm giving you something that's a bit

1403
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,160
more

1404
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,220
to your system a bit more elaborated to

1405
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,339
your business case let's say so the

1406
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:16,200
threat here is at a higher level than a

1407
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,240
library or a data flow or something like

1408
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,140
that

1409
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,760
I would try to come to you with the

1410
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,680
abuse cases that would prove that that

1411
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,359
thing that whatever mitigation was

1412
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,819
suggested actually happened and you can

1413
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,180
translate that into tests Okay so by

1414
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,500
giving the suggestion try to give it

1415
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,319
packaged as a full thing not just

1416
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,880
throw something in their face and say

1417
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,859
now deal with it

1418
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,380
okay so then when you look to structure

1419
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,780
the feedback or how good of a job did

1420
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,160
you do

1421
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,380
um how do you actually link that back to

1422
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,640
like the construction countermeasures

1423
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,960
that we're identifying the other side I

1424
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,720
think you're providing this position

1425
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,980
another great one great question so

1426
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,520
my personal interpretation of that last

1427
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,940
question is more of uh meta thing let's

1428
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,680
look back at the process of threat

1429
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,319
modeling and see if it worked better

1430
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:09,359
but what you're saying is perfectly

1431
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,819
valid how do I know that the threat and

1432
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:14,280
correct me if I'm interpreting you wrong

1433
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,780
how do I know that a threat model

1434
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,640
actually brought value

1435
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,400
right right

1436
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,960
they wanted to say was this a valuable

1437
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,240
investment in time and can I prove that

1438
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,980
this resulted in

1439
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,780
the viable reduction in vulnerabilities

1440
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,940
or reduction in Risk like the business

1441
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,880
needs risk also when we can bring that

1442
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,460
back to hey this exercise that we did

1443
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,280
resulted in X number of produced

1444
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,680
vulnerabilities as compared to uh

1445
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,359
whatever we were doing before or not

1446
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:47,339
look like so here's the thing

1447
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:50,760
what you're trying to do is parallel to

1448
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,859
proving a negative

1449
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:54,900
there is a universe of vulnerabilities

1450
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,599
in there I did something that Universe

1451
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,020
now is a very small set of galaxies

1452
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,260
that's basically impossible to prove

1453
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,799
but

1454
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,559
if you look at results of tests and here

1455
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm throwing threat modeling as an

1456
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,380
activity happening in a system that

1457
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,000
already exists and that there is already

1458
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,799
a framework around it

1459
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,859
if you look at tests before and after

1460
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:22,380
and you can say okay before I had a lot

1461
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,440
of findings on cross-site scripting

1462
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,780
and then during my threat modeling I

1463
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,000
came up with of course for as obvious

1464
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,280
but for for others less that Crossfire

1465
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,200
scripting is a problem

1466
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,760
and that because of the Frameworks that

1467
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,680
we use either there is some flag that we

1468
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,200
can turn on or there is some filter that

1469
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,839
we can put in some library that we can

1470
00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:45,299
put in there and all of a sudden all the

1471
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:46,619
good things that need to happen for

1472
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,319
cross-site scripting to go away happened

1473
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,760
and now we don't see cross-site

1474
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,220
scripting at all so by changing the

1475
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,660
design or by changing some of the

1476
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,460
elements of the design we completely

1477
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,520
obliterated one class of findings and

1478
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,220
believe me there are enough

1479
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,380
the way that I say is everybody can do

1480
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,240
it no not everybody can do it but there

1481
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,400
are enough examples out there of times

1482
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,140
when it was done

1483
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,460
and those are the times when you see

1484
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,819
that hey we completely changed the the

1485
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:15,559
the

1486
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,839
landscape here because threat modeling

1487
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:21,780
identified one change in design that's

1488
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,720
able to obliterate that whole kind of

1489
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,540
of punk so you're not speaking in terms

1490
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,339
of hard quantities

1491
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:31,680
you are speaking in terms of I'm giving

1492
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,599
you time and resources to focus on other

1493
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,220
things because you don't have to look at

1494
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,359
these things

1495
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:39,599
right so that's one way of explaining

1496
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,420
another problem here is and this could

1497
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,180
be a talk by itself

1498
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,980
you have findings on a threat model now

1499
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,180
you have to order them what do I do

1500
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,140
before

1501
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,559
oh let's talk risk no let's not let's

1502
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,240
definitely not

1503
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,359
okay because risk is probability times

1504
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,220
impact you don't know what the

1505
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,020
probability is you can only guess what

1506
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,400
the impact is

1507
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,559
let's talk priority

1508
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,500
okay what are the things that we have a

1509
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,760
security point of view are more

1510
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,040
important for you to fix now than those

1511
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,480
others

1512
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,059
have a clear story

1513
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,000
of why are those more important which

1514
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,760
could be based on

1515
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,559
the exposure of the things behind that

1516
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,480
thing

1517
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,640
how close it is to the top of the attack

1518
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,140
surface

1519
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,180
uh

1520
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,319
again one fix fix a stand of these so I

1521
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,760
probably want to put some time into this

1522
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
before I do the one outlier case here

1523
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,880
that needs its specific thing right so

1524
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,980
try to find factors that are important

1525
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,839
to you that explain what the priority of

1526
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,579
each one of the findings is

1527
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:50,099
and keep banging on those

1528
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:51,660
okay

1529
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:52,730
thank you

1530
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:56,730
[Applause]
