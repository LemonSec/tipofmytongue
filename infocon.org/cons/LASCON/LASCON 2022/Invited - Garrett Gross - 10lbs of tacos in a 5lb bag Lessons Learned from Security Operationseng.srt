[Music]

6
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,579
thanks so much let's give a round of

7
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,960
applause for all the folks running a

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,100
loss like thanks so much

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,239
you guys do an excellent job I mean I

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,220
was telling Kyle like the the badges are

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,080
even super cool this year they don't

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
expect that

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
um it's okay I'm gonna try to do the

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
best I can maybe take this thing out

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,960
there we go

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,460
um I'm going to talk a little bit about

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,080
a security operations some of the

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
lessons that I've learned uh running

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,400
security teams sorry uh for the picture

20
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,920
right before lunch but I love tacos

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,200
um while the original idiom is probably

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
a little bit more appropriate and feel

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,680
like putting that up on your screen so

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,799
uh sorry not sorry and you know what due

25
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,259
to the amount of technical uh diplomacy

26
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,060
and Cat hurting involved in the job that

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,820
I did this would also be a

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,340
appropriate uh let's see here

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,680
appropriate title for this talk I

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,240
actually came up with like five

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,520
different titles this morning uh in the

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
shower but I realized I should probably

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
stop and they're actually pretty good

34
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
titles to be used

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,560
um also a disclaimer this is a story of

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,939
transformation so naturally there's

37
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,159
going to be some humble Not So Graceful

38
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,560
Beginnings but much like a proper

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
postmortem in an incident you know it's

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,640
going to be blameless not meant to cast

41
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,259
anyone in a bad light

42
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,780
so let's start with the talking uh

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,840
starting with me uh who am I why am I uh

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
why am I up here talking to you

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,099
um certainly not as famous as Adrian or

46
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,080
Dan or you know Marcus we saw yesterday

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,780
so well I do hate talking about myself I

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,879
feel like I should explain why I'm up

49
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,020
here talking to you

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,879
um my name is Garrett gross as Kate said

51
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm the senior director of technical

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,080
sales at Huntress where I head up the

53
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,340
organization that contains sales

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,500
engineering and a couple of other Skunk

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,959
Works projects we have in the mix

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,959
I can consider myself a lifelong hacker

57
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,239
um career security researcher but when I

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,980
started out I call myself a penetration

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,140
tester I'm sure as a lot of you know

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
that entailed me finding a bunch of

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,780
things that you don't want me to find

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,420
and writing up a nice report of uh you

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,519
know what I found so you can address

64
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,019
more of a creative writing gig you know

65
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,640
if you ask me

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,860
um there's actually a lot of different

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,360
areas in penetration testing that you

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
can specialize in I specialize in

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,680
initial access things like uh you know

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,300
reconnaissance and stuff like that so

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,700
using information on the internet people

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,920
put out there even back then was way too

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,540
much nowadays it's

74
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,120
crazy social engineering I think a

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
couple other speaker speakers have

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,060
talked about that getting people to do

77
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,159
things that they normally wouldn't do

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,099
like enumerate an entire I.T stack over

79
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,500
the phone with someone you just met

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,640
um and of course you know writing

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
exploits for vulnerabilities and servers

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,519
networks phones cameras whatever

83
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,200
certainly done some shady stuff in the

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
past that we just won't have enough time

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,800
to get to today but I've learned that

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
crime does not pay

87
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,540
as well as security software

88
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,220
but really I use the my past experience

89
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,840
to understand the motivations of those

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,060
that want to do your harm so I know that

91
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,860
if I were running attack campaigns today

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,620
I would Target uh folks with the least

93
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,000
amount of resources those that don't

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,980
have the ability to defend themselves

95
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,440
working backwards I target folks that

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,360
think they have the resources to defend

97
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,239
themselves and when I am successful uh

98
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,040
they usually have the most to lose so

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
more susceptible to things like escort

100
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
in tandem I try to do all this uh you

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,480
know in the least amount of time

102
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,580
producing the least amount of noise and

103
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,680
maximize my time on net to produce the

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,720
largest effect and don't get me wrong

105
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm not trying to put myself out as the

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,340
most lead hackser I mean certainly not

107
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
today I'm like a a script Kitty at this

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
point but I am an expert on the

109
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,000
motivation to those that want to do your

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,220
uh and throughout my career I've got

111
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,680
some uh land some pretty cool jobs uh

112
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
first job was a network engineer at a

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,520
small Cisco shop in the Las Vegas area

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,740
uh right around the time everyone was

115
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,360
networking all the things

116
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,240
I had access to some pretty cool areas

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
that probably not a lot of folks have

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,080
it's pretty cool since then done loads

119
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,020
of security research been a CIS admin

120
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,240
worked in tech support I was a sales

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,100
engineer I suppose I still am a sales

122
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,100
engineer I advise uh some product teams

123
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,660
at several security vendors where I met

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,680
Kate

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
I was the principal engineer on Palo

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,040
Alto security team for about a month buy

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,360
me a beer and I'll tell you that story

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,820
it's not even really a cool story I just

129
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,540
like free beer

130
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,560
but uh most recently what I'm here to

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
talk to you about today is I built and

132
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,520
ran a security operations center for a

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,600
decent sized Global software company

134
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,340
I have tried out for the Blue Man Group

135
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,080
but legally I can't say anything more

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
about that so now that we've gotten to

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,560
know each other a little bit better

138
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,880
let's talk about the current state of

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
security

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,380
it's not good

141
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,580
really though we're starting to we're

142
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,900
still seeing trends that indicate that

143
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,180
things are just not getting better for

144
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,880
instance 82 percent over four out of

145
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,560
five breaches involved users doing

146
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
things that we should so whether that's

147
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,419
uh us giving up our credentials clicking

148
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,639
a link in a phishing email uh doing

149
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,699
Shady stuff on company assets or simply

150
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,039
making mistakes we still play a large

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,320
role in incidents and breaches alike and

152
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,120
the pessimist and you might say oh well

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
you know you can't fix stupid stupidness

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,259
forever I think that's Ron White

155
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,180
actually

156
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,400
but uh I see it as a really huge

157
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,139
opportunity for us to intervene in a

158
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,759
large amount of breaches just by Leading

159
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,860
with education

160
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,240
that's about all the feel good you're

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,560
going to get by the way this isn't a

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,479
Tony Robbins talk

163
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,280
um let's talk about attack complexity so

164
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,319
the vast majority of attacks that we see

165
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,360
out there include only a handful of

166
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,360
steps uh three in fact fishing initial

167
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,280
access and malware deployment usually

168
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,319
ransomware or you know saw a lot of

169
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,780
crypto miners too that's what comprises

170
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,600
the majority of tax with very few uh

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
leveraging more than five or four five

172
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,380
or more actions well our job as

173
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,060
Defenders is to lengthen that attack

174
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,460
chain uh not only to give us more time

175
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,819
to respond and hopefully recover but

176
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,800
attackers tend to give up or even avoid

177
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,139
uh you know scenarios where the the

178
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,759
longer attack chain will keep them more

179
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,500
exposed

180
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,419
uh let's talk about ransomware

181
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,220
everyone's favorite uh certainly not

182
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,620
slowing down in fact rentsware increased

183
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,440
13 over the previous year uh which is a

184
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,600
Dr a jump greater than the last five

185
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
years combined which is hilarious

186
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,500
because that's what I feel we always say

187
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,060
we talk about ransomware it's just

188
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,400
always this exponential rise in activity

189
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,199
why is that important why is that

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,240
significant well because with ransomware

191
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,979
threat actors don't have to spend as

192
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,199
much time on your environment they spend

193
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,819
way less time in reconnaissance looking

194
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,620
for key assets because that's usually

195
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,840
not the goal typically you just need a

196
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,220
single entry point you know someone

197
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,680
clicking a link and a email opening a

198
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,900
file something and with how most modern

199
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,599
ransomware campaigns go down uh as long

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,160
as you have that you can own at least

201
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
one machine maybe spread to others which

202
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,120
would obviously be better or worse

203
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,639
depending on who you are uh encrypt the

204
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,319
data and steal it you can interrupt

205
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,940
business you can get folks attention and

206
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,099
move very quickly to extortion

207
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,380
hell ransomware groups don't even have

208
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,360
to have uh in-house development anymore

209
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,880
uh ransomware as a service has been a

210
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,680
thing uh it's been around forever now

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
you don't have to really even know how

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
to code like like me uh anyone with

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,039
money motivation the ability to transact

214
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,780
on the dark web can run a pretty

215
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,300
effective Ransom campaign

216
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,099
but you might say oh but you still need

217
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,199
to be able to get in uh Target people

218
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,199
with phishing emails uh social engineer

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,580
them to give out their credentials

220
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,879
maintain a network of C2 servers and you

221
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,560
know Shady Financial components you can

222
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,599
get paid and not get caught but to that

223
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
I'd say you're dead wrong every single

224
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,720
one of those that I mentioned has

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,299
actually been commoditized right now uh

226
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,979
and not only are there you know dark web

227
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,539
marketplaces where you can buy all this

228
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,339
stuff uh but they have like custom

229
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,539
customer testimonials about us sections

230
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,279
don't blame me

231
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,160
100 hey look at us we're just a team of

232
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,660
enterprising young cyber security

233
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,300
enthusiasts helping you to be a menace

234
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,760
to society

235
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,040
and I mean I I can't knock the hustle

236
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,959
and as much you know folks or as much

237
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,880
trouble as these folks have caused me I

238
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
get it it's just like the complete lack

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,540
of awareness that I just don't get

240
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
whatever

241
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,500
um so what does all this mean why am i

242
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,899
showing all all this uh fear uncertainty

243
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,000
and doubt uh well it takes up 10 minutes

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,640
of my presentation uh but it also tells

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,899
you that you know attacks are happening

246
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,000
way more often uh they require less

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,820
manual steps less technical prowess and

248
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,260
operate more like a spray and prey

249
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,899
attack so so less way less Target

250
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,640
and from one of the studies that I'm

251
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,860
referencing uh the Verizon data breach

252
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,240
investigation report which you should

253
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,700
read every single year if you don't have

254
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,019
time to read it they produce a nice

255
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,360
executive summary Verizon will take your

256
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,820
check thank you in that study they found

257
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,380
that the number one and number two

258
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,240
motivations behind attacks were

259
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,700
financial and Espionage related but I'd

260
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
counter that you know uh the Espionage

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,839
is probably just a further some plot for

262
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,920
financial gain

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,360
you can always follow the money right

264
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,820
but that's uh it's its own talk

265
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,339
but to show you how much money is in it

266
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,800
uh in 2020 the average initial Ransom

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,540
demand was almost half a million dollars

268
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,940
with a top Ransom demand of three

269
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,380
million dollars

270
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,980
so fast forward a year 12 months and it

271
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,220
jumped to any guesses

272
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,740
anybody no

273
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,560
more than quadrupled to an average of

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,600
2.2 million dollars with the ceiling of

275
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,640
almost five and a half million dollars

276
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,440
and these stats by the way these are no

277
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
secret to those in the know in fact uh

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,519
threat actors love to brag if anyone's

279
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,860
familiar with uh Gand crab anyone from a

280
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,040
gang crab uh very famous for netting

281
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,860
themselves over two billion dollars in

282
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,060
the course of a year for all you

283
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,800
non-math nerds that is two and a half

284
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,019
million dollars a week

285
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,459
um and they're very famous for when they

286
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,959
retired they sent out a really nasty

287
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,760
note to rub all our faces in and they

288
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,100
said something like we've we've proven

289
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,320
you can do evil without retribution just

290
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,420
a real real thing to say after

291
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,640
they rob you for all that myself I think

292
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,380
it's safe to say uh this is not going to

293
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,880
go away this is not going to fix itself

294
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,959
on its own

295
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,720
and as Dan pointed out guess what else

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,079
won't go away supply chain issues uh

297
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,360
breaches from cassaya we don't talk

298
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,120
about that one a lot near enough

299
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,500
solarwinds log for Jay like Dan talked

300
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,240
about a lot they remind us that these

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
third-party systems that we depend on

302
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,019
are just as likely an attack Factor as

303
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,640
our own environment

304
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,500
and these days every company every

305
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,120
industry relies on some sort of Internet

306
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,180
connected technology or iot device to

307
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,640
function or at the very least compete

308
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,500
can anyone here think of an example

309
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,120
where a job doesn't use technology at

310
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,680
all

311
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,180
I love being stopped

312
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,380
babysitting ah keep keep track of your

313
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,300
time how are you gonna get paid and use

314
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,860
you know a mobile app they have mobile

315
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,600
babysitting apps and the babysitters you

316
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,700
want to use are probably using some kind

317
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,880
of trust verification you know uh

318
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,279
crowdsourcing reputation spoiler alert

319
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,720
there are no jobs that use it the

320
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,579
closest I've gotten was someone said a

321
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,279
uh an actor portraying a blacksmith in

322
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,560
the field and Colonial Williamsburg and

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,480
I was like because that's that's that's

324
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
that's really good but but even then I

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,680
give that person two weeks before they

326
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,360
see that their direct deposit didn't hit

327
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,800
they're like I think I'm gonna go back

328
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,140
to Hot Topic

329
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,640
um so think about your organization

330
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,260
think about your own Reliance on this

331
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,600
technology the software and then think

332
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,339
about the access that you give to this

333
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,660
technology and how that could be used

334
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,600
against you not a pretty thought right

335
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
so what do we do about it uh how do you

336
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,220
defend against a team of hyper Vigilant

337
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,620
well-funded

338
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,760
non-discriminatory you know uh Team of

339
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
jerks where you hire this guy

340
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,519
and if he's not available uh you have to

341
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,959
build a security operations team

342
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,459
comprised of folks doing some of the

343
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,920
things you see up here on the screen

344
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
um but that's that's not even really a

345
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,700
good answer because like anything you

346
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,560
can make security operations as complex

347
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,839
or as simple as you like uh even then

348
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,540
where do you start you know uh even if

349
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,220
you try to tackle the first four which

350
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,959
someone would argue or table Stakes

351
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,600
those alone could be daunting for a

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,880
well-run rounded security operations

353
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,519
team to plan out uh deploy new

354
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,079
initiatives every three months or so

355
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,360
maintain operational status of the of

356
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,060
those initiatives oh and you know defend

357
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,260
against all the people that are trying

358
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,660
to uh kick your door down every day um

359
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,980
and I know this because that's exactly

360
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,740
what I did and while we were pretty

361
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,500
capable but certainly well funded uh it

362
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,660
was not a walk in the park uh not at all

363
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,279
and I would say it was touch and go at

364
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,000
times

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
so if it's that difficult for what I

366
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,620
would consider an Enterprise grade team

367
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,079
uh making up maybe one percent of the

368
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,060
teams that we see out there what about

369
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,060
the other 99 how do they even stand a

370
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,680
chance

371
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,180
let's take a closer look at the

372
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,100
differences between these two teams uh

373
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,480
let's take a look at the security

374
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,220
operations center of your dreams versus

375
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,100
what we're you know mostly saddled with

376
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,560
first up life in the one percent uh

377
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,480
specialized team to cover shifts usually

378
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,200
24x7 dual layered you know if if Bob has

379
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,060
to take a mental health day Nancy can

380
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,339
take over uh you've got specialized

381
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,279
folks a manager engineer analyst you got

382
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,680
people that can focus solely on incident

383
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,200
response solely on threat hunting uh you

384
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,459
got people running project management

385
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,800
you can just keep adding people here pen

386
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,139
testers malware analysts Baristas

387
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,139
whatever the team is very well funded in

388
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,000
fact you're scrambling to to spend

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,100
budget by the end of the year and all

390
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,839
this is driven by policy that has been

391
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,760
created well before you arrived and is

392
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,820
maintained elsewhere uh and all security

393
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,560
action is flowing through this team and

394
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,820
they're the ones effectively driving

395
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,160
security awareness for the company and

396
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,320
by the way likely part of a greater

397
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,839
security Utopia so other fleshed out

398
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,399
areas within security security

399
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,160
architecture governance risk compliance

400
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,360
stuff like that

401
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,339
and keep in mind these teams exist I

402
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,380
I've worked on them but it's just not

403
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,660
attainable or even reasonable for anyone

404
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,180
outside the largest corporations of the

405
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,760
world or the US military to plan or

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,860
maintain anything closeness uh this this

407
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,160
is millions in salary employees alone

408
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,380
the more likely scenario is glorified

409
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,300
guerrilla warfare where we're just kind

410
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,540
of reacting all the time uh limited

411
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,160
staff likely not enough people to cover

412
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,260
24x7 you're having to augment Yourself

413
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,980
by leveraging managed Services no one is

414
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,139
specialized everyone's wearing several

415
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,000
hats jack of all trades sounding

416
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,380
familiar to anyone I mean I worked on

417
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,139
these teams too so I get it little to no

418
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:23,820
funding you're always having to Justify

419
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,639
Your Existence uh and always having to

420
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,260
fight for attention and influence

421
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,000
because even if you are well funded

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,860
getting people to listen to you or

423
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,600
enforce your policies is still very very

424
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,420
tough uh I would even say a likely

425
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,860
scenario is that your budget is going to

426
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,899
be lumped in with I.T so even then

427
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,760
you're having to convince other

428
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,320
technically Savvy folks that you're more

429
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,199
important which you are trust me

430
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,000
um policy if it exists uh it's either

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,579
lacking a specificity so uh or it's not

432
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,100
updated so it's not usable uh and then

433
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,899
this team is security meaning if it

434
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,339
doesn't come from this team it's not

435
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,800
happening the buck stops there so again

436
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
you you find yourself really only

437
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,639
fighting fires and reacting all the time

438
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,660
and

439
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,399
um if not properly managed you'll never

440
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,800
evolve past that

441
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,300
so let's get to the meat of the

442
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,339
presentation uh we'll talk about a

443
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,560
little bit my about my journey I'll set

444
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,600
the stage a little bit a good friend of

445
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
mine reached out to me and said you know

446
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,320
hey my butt he sounds nothing like that

447
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,880
I don't know why I just did that hey my

448
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
buddy and I just joined a company uh we

449
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,060
need someone to build security from the

450
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,160
ground up so I was like okay come from

451
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,959
the startup world I imagine like seven

452
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,639
folks in a broom closet talking about

453
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,940
you know uh trust relationships but uh

454
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,639
the reality was much more interesting

455
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,079
what they had actually joined was a 15

456
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,660
year old several hundred million dollar

457
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,820
a year Global software company in a

458
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,040
turnaround phase I'm trying to look in

459
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
the room to see if he's doing from that

460
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,579
company here feverishly

461
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,740
um they're making key Investments at

462
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,360
this time to reinvent the business and

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,620
one of those key Investments was

464
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,079
security and I was told that it needed

465
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,300
some work

466
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,339
boy did it

467
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,660
uh what I walked into was what someone

468
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,459
describes a dumpster fire

469
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,040
um we had a Security executive who was

470
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,619
writing policy I really don't know uh

471
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,480
what else he was doing uh maybe

472
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,699
answering sales questionnaires a lot of

473
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,079
those

474
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,380
um we had it handling security uh with

475
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,260
two dedicated people covering about 1500

476
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,480
employees across 20 physical offices

477
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,880
over 10 000 endpoints across those

478
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,799
offices remote work data center Cloud

479
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,820
devops ran their own security

480
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,039
uh let's I'll talk about that in a sec

481
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,240
um there wasn't much in the way of

482
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,039
security process that was my point um

483
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,720
there was this weird adherence to change

484
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,580
management though which made other

485
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,500
things very difficult

486
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,240
um there was also no security technology

487
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,820
well little little technology there was

488
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,580
basic endpoint detection response uh

489
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,440
there was a Sim that was highly

490
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,360
neglected not really curated or kept up

491
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,760
there was some phone scanning and I do

492
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,260
give these teams grief but they were

493
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,480
actually running some Ops um

494
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,700
like I said bonus assessment monitoring

495
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,039
Some Cloud logs for events

496
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,900
um great team super talented just as

497
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,419
you'll see thematically just not a not a

498
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,320
lot of love from above

499
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,880
so some of the other initial challenges

500
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,380
um we didn't really have functional

501
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,720
incident response in in my opinion

502
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,580
um there was no incident Response Team

503
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,799
defined now I need to be careful what I

504
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,380
say here uh there was a team of like

505
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,840
security roles and then who on the sea

506
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
level they would call when the hit

507
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,140
the fan there wasn't like an Incident

508
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,260
Commander you know uh Deputy scribe

509
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,780
Liaisons laid out no no formal process

510
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,419
that I felt would actually be useful

511
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,760
um and it hadn't really been tested I

512
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,980
mean it had been tested annually you

513
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,380
know to adhere to to external

514
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,660
culpability but um it did just hadn't

515
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,980
been tested like table tops and stuff

516
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
that I would I recommend were effective

517
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,780
there's no centralized control of

518
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,760
infrastructure which is really really

519
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,020
taxing

520
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,419
um this was due to past M A never really

521
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,820
getting finished but also just uh it was

522
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,740
an engineering-led organization so there

523
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,240
are new development environments popping

524
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,520
up all the time without our purview and

525
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,140
we just kept finding stuff I mean just

526
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,880
all the time

527
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,780
um

528
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,880
managed Network this is a new one for me

529
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,160
uh this made natural Network

530
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,320
introspection absolutely impossible I

531
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,299
mean we had visibility but really to do

532
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,940
anything you know was like a 24-hour

533
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,980
delay and and I don't want to say that

534
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,419
they are belking the company because I

535
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,280
don't want them to sue me but they were

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,080
providing least effort at a premium

537
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,700
price and you know the time zone delay

538
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,980
certainly didn't help so managed

539
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,200
networks your mileage may vary

540
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
um as I mentioned engineering kind of

541
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,620
did what they please uh they broke

542
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,360
themselves up into cloistered groups and

543
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
they called tribes their words uh

544
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
replete with you know Warfare and

545
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,419
everything some some tribes are great

546
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,460
some were developing with security in

547
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,440
mind some were exposing postgres

548
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,660
databases to the Internet so it was a

549
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,299
very wide swath of uh considerations of

550
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,640
security at first I just thought this

551
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,460
was a product a bad M A hygiene but then

552
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,080
I was like wait a minute maybe this is

553
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
deliberate maybe it allows this

554
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,740
malleability and they all get to act as

555
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,020
startups but then I realized much like

556
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,640
everything else it was just a lack of

557
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,179
curation planning and an investment and

558
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,120
as an aside in a highly mature org not

559
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,799
them this probably would have worked you

560
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,500
know kind of have that incubator type

561
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,760
setup which is pretty cool

562
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,160
uh last one we'll talk about here uh

563
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,660
onboarding and off-boarding was also in

564
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,340
transition which is great because that

565
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,840
was another significant investment that

566
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
was being made in the company but it was

567
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,559
being run tandem with a lot of other

568
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,080
improvements like myself so it was like

569
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,360
a general contractor scheduling all the

570
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,039
builders and different you know various

571
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
uh areas to show up at once and we just

572
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
ended up tripping all over one another

573
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,240
um and I want to get into specifics uh

574
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,980
because we'll be here all day but I

575
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,240
caused a lot of problems when trying to

576
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,460
track user activity when the user record

577
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,799
is updated constantly

578
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,620
all right uh there was some history with

579
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,120
our leadership team

580
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,860
um what I failed to mention earlier was

581
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,240
that the Buddy of my friend was actually

582
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,419
the former CEO of a larger software

583
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,100
company who had been through arguably

584
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,620
one of the more grueling public breaches

585
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,059
in recent history

586
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,100
uh one of the main themes in this his

587
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,780
latest Venture was security as I'm sure

588
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,700
he didn't want to testify in front of

589
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,160
Congress again so let's just say all

590
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,860
eyes are on me

591
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,600
um and I went into this with the best

592
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,880
intentions I came up with the 360 90 day

593
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,980
plan uh I was going to meet everyone

594
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,740
strategically carefully methodically

595
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,780
pour through everything but just

596
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,940
realized very quickly that I had no idea

597
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,620
what I was doing

598
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,840
that's not true um Blissful ignorance

599
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,919
probably would have been easier to

600
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,120
explain

601
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,620
um I did know what I was doing but I had

602
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,840
no idea what I got myself

603
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
so my reapproach after lots of crying

604
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,419
was to scrap my 30 60 90 day plan and

605
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,520
address things in the following order

606
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,740
get initial visibility

607
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,659
develop a team

608
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:00,539
identify existing security controls then

609
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,940
start looking at policy processing

610
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,320
procedure but from a strategic

611
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,820
standpoint look at things like incident

612
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,100
response vulnerability management

613
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,780
acceptable use stuff like that and then

614
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,340
moving forward I'm gonna have to you

615
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,780
know Define securities long-term

616
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,580
strategy and communicate externally what

617
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,200
we're doing

618
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
so digging into that uh let's talk about

619
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,700
what I did in regard to visibility but

620
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,080
first let's talk about this is what

621
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,460
happens when marketing doesn't get

622
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,140
involved in my slides I made some joke

623
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,240
about visibility and large font I don't

624
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,159
know we're gonna go with it

625
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,780
um so to get better visibility

626
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,760
identified key assets and then hardened

627
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,280
them so things like assets where

628
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,860
sensitive data is stored identity

629
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,539
providers you know domain controller

630
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,840
stuff like that any assets owned by VIPs

631
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,400
hardly operating system added them to a

632
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,500
little extra scrutiny when we start

633
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,720
deploying detection response tools

634
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,220
they'd be added to like watch lists and

635
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,539
stuff like that just add a little bit

636
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,460
more visibility onto things that we felt

637
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,340
uh would be more highly targeted

638
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,039
uh we got EDR everywhere

639
00:22:59,039 --> 00:22:59,580
um

640
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,159
endpoint detection response by the way

641
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,140
um I walked into an existing

642
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,460
relationship with a vendor so I didn't

643
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,740
get to choose who we used but I mean in

644
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,360
this case even Windows Defender would

645
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,100
have been acceptable in fact some would

646
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,020
argue that Windows Defenders better than

647
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,820
a lot of paid for options but again

648
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,620
probably its own talk

649
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,600
um we put EDR everywhere I mean

650
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,000
everywhere that touched the internet

651
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,740
um was that the right approach

652
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,200
the EDR vendor would probably say so

653
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,539
um the dev team not so much and then

654
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,760
we'll talk about that later

655
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,360
um

656
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
but up next I got an understanding of

657
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,720
you know what vulnerability assessments

658
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,980
have been done in the past where we

659
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,080
needed intelligence uh looked at past

660
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,559
penetration tests uh any plans uh that

661
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,080
we had for you know products

662
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,360
uh certifications or any Regulatory

663
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,039
Compliance stuff like that and then

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,760
while it wasn't in my purview I had to

665
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,260
understand the current status of product

666
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,120
security because we developed software

667
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,159
so current controls that they were using

668
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,679
tooling they were using assessments how

669
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,960
they're jacked into the psdlc stuff like

670
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,460
that

671
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,280
uh next up people and this includes not

672
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,140
only you know security operations assets

673
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,600
but also uh the other folks are our

674
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,659
company so first up was to assemble a

675
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,059
tiger team of experienced engineers and

676
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,419
this was pre-negotiated so you may not

677
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,799
want to just walk in every job and say

678
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,659
I'm hiring four people

679
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,179
um but I knew because of

680
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,100
the because of the mission at hand I

681
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,299
knew I had to have folks on the ground

682
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,460
immediately so that was absolutely

683
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,000
pre-negotiated and vital to my success

684
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,039
um I then drafted an org structure and

685
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,140
yes this helped me understand you know

686
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,299
where gaps were but it also allowed me

687
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,640
to avoid the mini hats problem so I had

688
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,220
a kind of a visual representation of as

689
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,200
responsibilities and roles were stacking

690
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,720
up that was kind of my you know clue to

691
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,700
start hiring more

692
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,919
I then started forming uh or meeting

693
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,320
people meeting key people across the org

694
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,480
as soon as possible I I think forming

695
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,820
good good authentic relationships with

696
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,620
people across your organization is as

697
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,200
important as getting the security right

698
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,840
um and when I first doing this or when I

699
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,280
first started doing this candidly I

700
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,360
thought I was being a little bit

701
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
political uh but then I realized that I

702
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,280
was just prioritizing the perspectives

703
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,140
of those around me and I'd find things

704
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,240
out like how is security made your job

705
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,559
harder

706
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,539
um what security improvements do you

707
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,720
think would make your job easier uh what

708
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,760
security things do you hate because they

709
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,200
weren't properly explaining and stuff

710
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
like that and I was able to get ahead of

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,679
problems in a lot of cases solve them

712
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,299
before they even got to be a real issue

713
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,400
you know it wasn't disingenuous it was

714
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,980
truly meant to be mutually beneficial I

715
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,720
had to include these folks in future

716
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,539
decisions get their feedback and try to

717
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:43,860
give them a real voice in the direction

718
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,659
of security and this is mostly involved

719
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,279
with like the development leaders and

720
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,320
how my controls were going to interact

721
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,760
with you know their future plans for

722
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,559
product development

723
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,960
uh this is a really important one um I

724
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,760
started company-wide comms on security

725
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,260
because no one was really talking about

726
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,820
security

727
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,840
um and I'm talking about leading with

728
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,020
education not fear uncertainty and doubt

729
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,120
like I led this presentation with

730
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,820
um not reprimand you know things like as

731
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,679
you're rolling out EDR you know what is

732
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,200
EVR why should you not hate it what is

733
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,059
it doing what is it not doing you know

734
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:17,039
we're not reading your emails the people

735
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,260
in it are reading your emails this is

736
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,120
totally different

737
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,179
um maybe you're under a lot of uh

738
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,039
submission attacks you know SMS based

739
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,200
fishing and you say hey I understand the

740
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,760
CEO has been contacting you for

741
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,380
Applebee's gift cards let's talk about

742
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,360
that and what that does is that

743
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,279
proactively starts getting people to

744
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,740
talk about security uh it increases

745
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,720
uptake of security it just I mean again

746
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,000
if promotes that kind of corporate

747
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,520
responsibility which I mean you know as

748
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,559
a quasi-anarchist I really don't care

749
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,059
about that but at the same time you want

750
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,620
people to you know take some ownership

751
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,640
of what they're doing and that's a

752
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,960
really great way to start talking about

753
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,600
security and get them involved

754
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,640
um next up understanding access at the

755
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,580
company so again I kind of walked in uh

756
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,140
way late in the game so I need to

757
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,539
understand what were the access levels

758
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,880
how were they provisioned uh who who has

759
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,100
all the admins how do you treat local

760
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,380
machine access stuff like that we

761
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,419
actually did a complete enumeration of

762
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,580
every single freaking identity account

763
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,539
we had across identity provider across

764
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,120
Cloud accounts yes this sucked but it

765
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,740
was awesome it was completely necessary

766
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,020
we found out stuff definitely can't get

767
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,779
into details there but like identity

768
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,919
containers that were in different

769
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,960
languages nested identity containers

770
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,760
that provided really weird trust

771
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,799
relationships so again just going

772
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,179
through and enumerating every single

773
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,159
account taking a look at that was was

774
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,419
what we had to do I'm sure there's

775
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,159
software out there that does that but we

776
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,380
uh we certainly didn't have the time or

777
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,360
the know-how

778
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
um we also wanted to try to do a

779
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,360
complete enumeration of every

780
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,700
application used but that's very very

781
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,279
difficult as I found out if you don't

782
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
have like a secure access service edge

783
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,760
or something like a web Gateway that's

784
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,860
actually filtering everything

785
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,840
um there are tools out there that do

786
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,740
this

787
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,179
um in fact a friend of mine launched a

788
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:04,740
company he didn't pay me so I'm not

789
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,940
going to mention the name of the company

790
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,520
but it'll use things like metadata in

791
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,919
your email to mine for

792
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,419
um emails from you know Cloud account

793
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,400
signups to kind of infer what you're

794
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,260
using pretty cool

795
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,460
um last but not least in the people

796
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,220
front uh security training uh but not

797
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,440
only are you doing it but how good is it

798
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,179
uh how often are you doing it is this

799
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,820
the check the box type activity or you

800
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,840
know are you actually trying to get

801
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
people engaged any guesses as to uh how

802
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,940
which way it was going with this

803
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,360
Corporation

804
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,520
yeah your word's not mine

805
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,559
um moving on I needed to identify what

806
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,059
controls were in use and I used my

807
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,640
trusty friend than this CSF uh again

808
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,020
it's own talk

809
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,120
um but we can use this by going around

810
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,980
the circle to you know talk about our

811
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,559
current security stack so the ability to

812
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,600
identify what's out there uh we talked

813
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,100
about or Dan talked about this with you

814
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,020
know attack service management asset

815
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,400
intelligence even vulnerability

816
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,080
assessment

817
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,640
but then how are we protecting ourselves

818
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,539
with things like antivirus firewalls

819
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,799
ssomfa you know single sign-on stuff

820
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,779
like that forget I'm talking to it a

821
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,380
group of devops folks uh disk encryption

822
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,059
um but also what are we using to detect

823
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,720
threats uh EDR xdr FDR whatever we're

824
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
calling it these days uh Sim IDs

825
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,820
um what are we using to respond to

826
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,799
attacks not only not only the controls

827
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,240
that we have on the endpoints like

828
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,880
Network isolation but what are we using

829
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,279
for incident response how are people

830
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,140
reporting incidents uh how are you

831
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,000
tracking them how are you talking about

832
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,279
them uh how are you documenting them

833
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,539
after the fact

834
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,399
and then also what automated responses

835
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,440
are in play and then finally how can you

836
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,779
recover from the attack uh in the way of

837
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,760
like you know backups not only do you

838
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,080
have them but are they validated and

839
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,000
tested uh do you have business

840
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,039
continuity and Disaster Recovery plans

841
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,140
are those validated and tested with real

842
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,720
world scenarios like uh uh tabletop

843
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,419
exercises do you have a cyber insurer do

844
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,039
you think they'll actually pay out based

845
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:04,020
on how you have your stack set up so the

846
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,760
point of this is I would make a running

847
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,460
list of controls I found next to you

848
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,320
know the the cyber security framework

849
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,179
and use that to guide my efforts and

850
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,799
prioritize what I was doing moving

851
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,299
forward

852
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,220
then after uh looked at the security

853
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,320
controls I had to look at improving our

854
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,120
security policies process and procedures

855
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,860
and like I said earlier on this is

856
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,120
something that I thought I would kind of

857
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,159
do at the onset but I found myself doing

858
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,500
this pretty much Midstream or what I

859
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,179
would consider late to the game but look

860
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,860
at things like our incident response

861
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,760
plan

862
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,740
um like I said how are incense reported

863
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,620
who is responding what's the SLA on that

864
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,480
how are we communicating about these

865
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,460
events uh vulnerability management

866
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,740
standard there's actually no SLA on

867
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,840
addressing bolts when I showed up so I

868
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,460
guess it was like a best effort you know

869
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,100
at addressing these things a quick win

870
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,740
here was actually to put a 24-hour

871
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,659
response time on any critical incidents

872
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,840
which is nice is that that you can

873
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,659
abstract the severity definition in

874
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,000
another uh you know reference document

875
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
or stuff like that so it doesn't really

876
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,700
put you in a weird position but it does

877
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,380
Institute anything classified as

878
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,960
critical responding 24 hours

879
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,240
um acceptable use policy we actually had

880
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,039
nothing around what you could use your

881
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,620
machine for or not for or except for

882
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,320
business purpose which I mean we had fun

883
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,120
defining different business purposes

884
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,299
around the security team past leadership

885
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,279
had taken a much more LAX approach so

886
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,539
that you know set a pretty difficult

887
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,460
standard to navigate

888
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,480
and then finally our information

889
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
security standard while there were no

890
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,120
hard requirements around off uh password

891
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,760
link complexity stuff like that most

892
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,260
folks were policing themselves pretty

893
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,779
well

894
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:43,980
next up I had to Define our vision

895
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,679
moving forward so first I want to make

896
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,600
sure that we knew what the primary

897
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,480
purpose of security operations was so we

898
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,220
were responding to incidents we were

899
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,260
detecting and hunting for threats and we

900
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,000
scan for vulnerabilities and reported on

901
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,700
what we found but we also make sure that

902
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,279
we assess these uh it says the

903
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,240
infrastructure in a way that didn't

904
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,919
disrupt the business when we

905
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,659
communicated our findings to our

906
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,240
stakeholders we made sure that what we

907
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,059
communicated made sense so giving them

908
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,880
examples of why this is an issue give an

909
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,919
example of what good what good or what

910
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:19,140
fix looks like speaking their language

911
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,000
and you know meeting meeting them where

912
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,980
they are and a good example of this is

913
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,919
you know don't make developers log into

914
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,899
your security tools with the

915
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,840
dark UI like no one no one wants to use

916
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,700
that you know if there's ways to Trigger

917
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,200
action from like their build automation

918
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,899
platforms with you know a good examples

919
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,539
like Jenkins triggering off you know

920
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,460
Dash scans and a

921
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,140
desk and or something like that do that

922
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,179
I found that to be much more effective

923
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,640
than trying to get them to work in my

924
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,820
tools and remediate from there

925
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,039
so moving on I need to reassess my

926
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,720
initial objectives just make sure they

927
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,059
still applied I was hired to stop the

928
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,120
bleeding check set up a team check build

929
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,399
a security stack check expand my

930
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,100
security per view it was in progress so

931
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,539
it looked like we're still moving ahead

932
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:09,659
but how do I define success moving

933
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:10,919
forward now that I kind of have my

934
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,399
initial objectives outlined well one way

935
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,600
to help you figure that out is to

936
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,059
communicate your progress externally not

937
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,440
only does that help you track your own

938
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,419
efforts but also just make sure that you

939
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,940
are aligned with you know your peers

940
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,159
management execs uh

941
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,159
and if you want my advice on you know

942
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:30,539
defining success it would be to start

943
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,179
small and iterate so instead of

944
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,080
um

945
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,019
a complete rollout of EDR 100 you know

946
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,880
work population by population I actually

947
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,100
made that mistake and had this concept

948
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,159
of 100 roll out looming over my head for

949
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
a period of several months and that that

950
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,919
was not fun

951
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,260
another example would be instead of

952
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,480
saying hey I'm I'm going to reduce risk

953
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,279
you know roll it out in phases where

954
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,200
you're starting with demonstrating the

955
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,480
ability to collect the right data to

956
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,360
show your risk and then figure out the

957
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,679
best way to demonstrate your reduction

958
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,559
risk and then actually move to reducing

959
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,960
the risk itself point being this phased

960
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,339
approach allows you like I said to

961
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,500
demonstrate progress internally and

962
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,599
externally as well as providing

963
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,060
opportunities to check your alignment

964
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,339
so then moving forward how do I evolve

965
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:18,719
security I had a lot of thoughts here I

966
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,280
don't want to spend a lot of but I want

967
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,199
to centralize incident response across

968
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,820
not only security issues but also

969
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,580
Financial issues disaster issues you

970
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,280
know things uh with with the pandemic in

971
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,960
full swing you know we were uh we're

972
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,339
thinking about things like that we

973
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,599
wanted to centralize infrastructure

974
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,040
management I talked about this earlier

975
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,379
but uh provide more of a catalog-based

976
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,300
approach to where you weren't rolling

977
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,399
your own infrastructure

978
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,679
um and then a common thing that we

979
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,820
wanted to roll out was just more

980
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,918
Automation and I'm not a I'm not a

981
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,500
developer obviously but I I so I'm not a

982
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,719
fan of leading with automation because

983
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,760
that's just not what I do but when we

984
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,199
found ourselves just doing the same

985
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,820
thing over and over again that was my

986
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,640
cue to maybe go learn something new

987
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,040
um brush up to my python a good example

988
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,599
of that would be validation of intent

989
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
like a lot of times we'd find something

990
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,520
on a client endpoint and because we were

991
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,380
developing software that oftentimes

992
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,619
looked like malware or an attack

993
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,300
um you know I'd have to mess I'd have to

994
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,680
slack out to these folks and say hey is

995
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,540
this you running malware.exe and then

996
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,240
yeah it's to me and then that that's

997
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,980
fine flag it as a false positive go

998
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,900
update our intelligence but if it's not

999
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,940
you know that's that's game on well what

1000
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,440
if we could set up a slack bot that

1001
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,640
would just go out there slack them

1002
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,380
present them with a yes or no box and

1003
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,180
say is this you or not that would just

1004
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,579
speed up our process and again uh get us

1005
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,220
to a quicker resolution

1006
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,000
so moving on you know this process of

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,040
deploying security to this company was

1008
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,560
not easy several roadblocks presented

1009
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,900
themselves uh but even before we got to

1010
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,540
the security itself hiring uh what a

1011
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,880
what a challenge that is

1012
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,380
um we were like I said earlier pretty

1013
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,540
well funded uh we still struggle to find

1014
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,520
people due to the very large number of

1015
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,040
jobs out there in security we had a

1016
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,440
large amount of unqualified applicants

1017
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,040
um

1018
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,780
here I recommend working with a

1019
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,000
recruiter and if you're trying to decide

1020
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,640
between internal like or external

1021
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,680
um pros and cons you know external

1022
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,020
recruiters can be a lifesaver you can

1023
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,700
also find yourself paying a lot of money

1024
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,579
for a hot garbage recruiter so then you

1025
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,680
may say well let's move to an internal

1026
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,060
recruiter but

1027
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,920
um you know that's just compounding the

1028
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,480
problem that's like hiring someone to

1029
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,820
help you hire people so it just you know

1030
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,040
prolongs that my advice would be augment

1031
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,599
staff with Outsourcing but just be

1032
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,760
prepared to pay through the nose

1033
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,560
um cheap talent's not worth it a whole

1034
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,540
adage of you know buy once cry once kind

1035
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,880
of comes into to play here

1036
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,560
we also worked against a general

1037
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,020
distrust of security and I'll admit we

1038
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,579
came in a little hot because we kind of

1039
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,960
you know opened up the doors and we're

1040
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,839
like what the are you guys doing so

1041
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,579
um naturally folks saw us as an

1042
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,380
impediment um like we were telling them

1043
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,180
how to how to do their jobs and I

1044
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,280
understand that but instead of fixing

1045
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,359
things they would just spend a lot of

1046
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,460
time poking holes in our process and our

1047
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,140
technology

1048
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,420
um the fix there is actually to have

1049
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,640
discussions that talk about a broader

1050
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,200
impact and

1051
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,880
um you know a lot of security people for

1052
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,380
some reason think that their audiences

1053
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,020
are not technical but again that's its

1054
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,000
own talk but I would recommend talking

1055
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,920
about things in in terms of impact and

1056
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,680
how RDP you know kind of ruins it for

1057
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,859
everyone not just the security team

1058
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,420
um we also had a complete lack of

1059
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,680
security awareness which is probably

1060
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,079
related to my my prior Point

1061
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:32,940
um and again not not sure how much

1062
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,320
detail I want to go into because we'll

1063
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,060
be here forever but some of the things

1064
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,220
that people did had me question or not

1065
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,200
like whether whether you're getting paid

1066
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,480
to work against me a lot of repeat

1067
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,000
really like a lot of repeated offenses

1068
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
from the same people a lot of

1069
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,180
low-hanging fruit

1070
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,020
um

1071
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,900
another obstacle and again blameless

1072
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,220
here not trying to just talk trash

1073
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,560
terrible I.T architecture I mean just

1074
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,140
just again not their fault just a

1075
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,260
complete lack of investment from uh from

1076
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,060
from the higher-ups and uh don't want to

1077
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,460
go into detail there and then lastly r d

1078
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,099
I know I just bag on RDS it just should

1079
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,920
be at the bag on R D talk but like I'd

1080
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,599
say nine times out of ten when we get a

1081
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,520
box popped it was R D

1082
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,839
um and it was stuff for like default

1083
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,000
creds on applications outdated versions

1084
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,880
of software again postgres exposed to

1085
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,560
the internet can anyone give me a good

1086
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,079
reason for just exposing postgres to the

1087
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,940
internet because I can write a book I've

1088
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,859
gotten every reason Under the Sun for

1089
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,060
that

1090
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,980
um they had no consideration of secure

1091
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,380
networking and uh you know I don't

1092
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,839
really expect them to but there was no

1093
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,300
no questions our way asking you know how

1094
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,400
can we set this up initially and then

1095
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,680
the last point with r d is that anyone

1096
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,839
could create infrastructure at one point

1097
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,440
we had Rogue Cloud accounts I want to go

1098
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,540
into detail but we had one cloud account

1099
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,700
that was expanding uh without our

1100
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,040
control at one point uh it was horrible

1101
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,960
but one of the most infuriating

1102
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,060
struggles that I like to talk about is

1103
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,920
security vendors and

1104
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,900
and I know I work for one but I'd like

1105
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,280
to say that we're outside of this

1106
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
population

1107
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
um this is the current security offender

1108
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,700
landscape of I think it's yeah it's 2021

1109
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,740
momentum they do a great job of updating

1110
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,420
this every year but

1111
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,880
um I'd say that in addition to just the

1112
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,820
the blinding and dizzying amount of

1113
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,220
vendors out there uh I'd say most

1114
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,540
vendors are not set up with the customer

1115
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,579
in mind which sounds counter-intuitive

1116
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,880
but think about it support sucks

1117
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,220
documentation sucks if your product has

1118
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,720
to integrate with something else the

1119
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,339
support and the documentation of that

1120
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,040
probably suck it's not because people in

1121
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,599
support suck like I said I was in

1122
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,579
support for a very long time it's just

1123
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,520
this myopic you know kind of

1124
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,260
um throw it over the fence type approach

1125
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,420
that you see a lot which again doesn't

1126
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,940
help out folks like myself

1127
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,320
um also a lot of these corporations are

1128
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,619
very salesy you know uh and again I work

1129
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,900
in the sales organization of a security

1130
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,640
software vendor but

1131
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,079
um that I feel like that's why I'm here

1132
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,400
you know I'm like the man on the inside

1133
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,880
working working my way out but uh what I

1134
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,140
found with a lot of vendors is that

1135
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,680
regardless of my specific problems my

1136
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,119
aspirations of what I want to do with

1137
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,740
security and made it with my

1138
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,320
capabilities uh I found that their

1139
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,700
product was always going to be the right

1140
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,020
solution for me

1141
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,640
which by the way just makes bad

1142
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
customers because even if you do trick

1143
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,119
me into buying your product I'm just

1144
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,339
going to make your life a living hell

1145
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:27,900
um and you know the other thing is I

1146
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,160
don't pretend to know everything in fact

1147
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,260
I think I've gained a lot of success by

1148
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,200
knowing that I know very little

1149
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,579
um so when I'm trying to solve a new

1150
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:37,020
problem and learn something new like

1151
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,000
Cloud workload protection or securing

1152
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,220
kubernetes kubernetes I can't even say

1153
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,619
it uh kubernetes something like that I'm

1154
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,020
just I met with a bunch of BS marketing

1155
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,640
convincing to me that their solution's

1156
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,619
the best way rather than leading with

1157
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,060
education and kind of coming to this

1158
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,280
decision together as to whether or not

1159
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,200
that's going to stop but again that's

1160
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,700
its own talk I'll quit bagging on

1161
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,500
security vendors

1162
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,119
let's shift gears let's talk about some

1163
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,560
of the quick wins

1164
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,240
um some of the uh things that put us in

1165
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,099
a much better position security wise but

1166
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,040
uh also helped us build momentum um you

1167
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,660
know momentum that I think is necessary

1168
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,040
for any initiative but especially

1169
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
security to get off the ground

1170
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,820
so as

1171
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,619
SFA single sign-on multi-factor

1172
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:19,079
authentication this is by far the best

1173
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,460
thing you can ever do for your

1174
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,660
organization

1175
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,700
um relatively it is the easiest to roll

1176
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,920
out it is the least expensive in my

1177
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,960
experience and it netted us the most

1178
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,079
protection of credential abuse out there

1179
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,599
in fact my former boss had a policy of

1180
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,579
like you know if if we hadn't rolled out

1181
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,440
MFA company-wide we're not doing

1182
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,599
anything else and we we only do that for

1183
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,339
a period of week two a couple weeks it's

1184
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,220
great uh I mentioned EDR talk about that

1185
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,140
a lot I'm a big fan of EDR and saved our

1186
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,940
butts a lot

1187
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,099
um but when you couple that with auto

1188
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,780
provisioning using like a mobile device

1189
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,079
management solution uh or like a custom

1190
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,540
Cloud automation we built some harness

1191
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,780
uh you know Elvish magic uh container

1192
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,420
thing that would automatically inject

1193
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,280
our EDR agent onto any instance that was

1194
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,780
created so any infrastructure that we

1195
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,579
would create would automatically be

1196
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:10,260
added to our security purview which was

1197
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,700
awesome

1198
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,400
uh aggregating control infrastructure so

1199
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,380
again I talked about this a lot we had a

1200
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,420
bunch of different groups managing their

1201
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,740
own infrastructure and we had official

1202
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,579
environments by the way we just had

1203
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:24,839
other people are just like I'm gonna do

1204
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,160
my own thing

1205
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,320
um I actually had Finance helped me out

1206
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,900
with this quick win here was to uh and

1207
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,940
this was not my idea this is I can't

1208
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,460
name her name but my homegrown Finance

1209
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,980
uh she said well why don't I just start

1210
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,500
declining all expense reports that have

1211
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,300
any kind of cloud services in them and

1212
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,400
I'll say to come you know see you before

1213
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,900
I approve them let's stop that real

1214
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,339
quick because again that was going

1215
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:48,960
against policy it's not like I was just

1216
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,720
being a jerk but the shutting the sieve

1217
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,640
off of you know the the

1218
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,500
reimbursing you for your probably large

1219
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,380
cloud account uh that that had a great

1220
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,940
effect a lot of conversations that were

1221
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,540
very positive netted from that

1222
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,680
um predefined security and cloud

1223
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,940
services you know I talked about this

1224
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,099
earlier but things like using known good

1225
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:09,079
images

1226
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:11,160
menu-based security groups stuff like

1227
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,420
that

1228
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,760
um insert response tabletops this is a

1229
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,740
huge one uh this is the best training

1230
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,480
that I feel a security team can do this

1231
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,280
puts you in a much better position of

1232
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,520
how to respond uh how to uh you know

1233
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,319
anticipate changes to your environment

1234
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,599
stuff like that and also it can be

1235
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,640
really fun even if you don't know much

1236
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,460
about IR there's a team uh Black Hills

1237
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,020
security house wearing their hoodie

1238
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,420
earlier not a not a paid shill but they

1239
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,160
put out a game called back doors and

1240
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,079
breaches anyone here heard of back doors

1241
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,060
and breaches it's awesome it's a card

1242
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,700
based game that simulates an incident

1243
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,339
response and you know it's it's a chance

1244
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,319
based and stuff like that but uh really

1245
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,000
fun kind of gets you talking about it if

1246
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,380
you don't want to pay for the decks they

1247
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,339
actually put them out on the internet

1248
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,300
for free so when for Black Hills

1249
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,060
um finally here agile not a developer

1250
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,160
this is something that was very very uh

1251
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,079
different for me but we had someone on

1252
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,119
the team that knew agile and she was a

1253
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,880
scrum master so this helped us be a lot

1254
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,619
more predictable in our efforts the

1255
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,680
external uh you know communication of

1256
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,940
what we were doing became much more

1257
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,560
effective when we communicated in this

1258
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,319
fashion but my advice here and I know

1259
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:21,180
I'm talking to a room of dance but if

1260
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,680
you're not familiar with agile don't do

1261
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,760
this it's

1262
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,280
it will actually absolutely add as an

1263
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,660
impediment if you're trying to figure

1264
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,280
this out while also trying to figure out

1265
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,020
your job

1266
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,060
so um some other Lessons Learned you

1267
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,440
know we talked about this a lot uh

1268
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,619
people process technology it's in my

1269
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:39,119
opinion laid out that way for a reason

1270
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,760
uh because I figured that the first

1271
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,220
place to invest is in people and hiring

1272
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,440
the right people that also could be its

1273
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,880
own talk but

1274
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,680
um my advice here is identify what needs

1275
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,440
to be done by the role Define exactly

1276
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,660
the type of person and capabilities that

1277
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,339
needs to be hired based on that and then

1278
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,980
hire that person only and what I mean by

1279
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,599
that is as you're interviewing people

1280
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,700
don't kind of see like oh you know maybe

1281
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,260
this person could do that or maybe this

1282
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,060
person could do that be very honest with

1283
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,380
yourself and hire those specific

1284
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,839
capabilities and if you can if you're

1285
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,839
having a hard time finding that unicorn

1286
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,180
Outsource if you need to but you know my

1287
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,800
advice here if you're Outsourcing even

1288
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,119
if you plan on doing that into

1289
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:20,880
perpetuity build out a plan of

1290
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,500
self-sustainability and understand what

1291
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,480
that looks like financially because I

1292
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,859
don't know anything about Finance I mean

1293
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,480
ask my wife but like one of the lessons

1294
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,339
that I've learned is that positioning

1295
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:30,480
that in a way of how it's going to

1296
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,819
affect your bottom line uh alleviates a

1297
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:34,560
lot of conversations that might be more

1298
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,880
difficult in the future if you have to

1299
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,960
justify that uh actively

1300
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,180
process create repeatable processes use

1301
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,220
known steps known standards or

1302
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,520
Frameworks I mentioned the CSF uh I

1303
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,880
think Dan mentioned open Sam obviously

1304
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,859
the top 10 but also Regulatory

1305
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,180
Compliance Frameworks if you're taking

1306
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,099
payment cards if you're dealing with Phi

1307
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:59,060
you know PCI DSS HIPAA stuff like that

1308
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,839
identify where you're missing and then

1309
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:03,319
build to that and don't do it halfway

1310
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:06,060
meaning like if it's just a check the

1311
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,040
box methodology it's it's going to blow

1312
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,900
up in your face because

1313
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,480
I mean maybe if you're only able to do

1314
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,859
it halfway it's because it's not an

1315
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:15,599
optimized process and you need to add it

1316
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,119
to the mix some technology

1317
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,400
um I feel this would be the last option

1318
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,079
for solving problems

1319
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,400
um I don't think you should use

1320
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,440
technology to look at look for problems

1321
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,599
like what we oftentimes see with soar

1322
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,460
again not being a developer is just not

1323
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,560
something that I lead with

1324
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,540
um but then bottom line here would be

1325
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,800
just forget everything that I said

1326
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,160
because if you know of people processor

1327
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,720
technology that works 10 times out of

1328
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,760
ten lead with that a great example would

1329
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,720
be

1330
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,940
um you know rapid sevens next modes or

1331
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,980
IBM not a paid fill but like it's

1332
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,420
something that I'm very experienced with

1333
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,619
the team that I was hiring had

1334
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,599
experience with so we knew that it

1335
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,040
wasn't going to be an impediment it's

1336
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,480
going to be a force multiplier as we

1337
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,940
roll that out

1338
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,480
okay

1339
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,460
um I know I'm close on time but a couple

1340
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,960
of the final lessons learned that I'll

1341
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,339
part to you

1342
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,020
um is that every company struggles with

1343
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,460
the following challenges it's funny

1344
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,960
because Dan I don't know if Dan's still

1345
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,099
in here

1346
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,800
um he mentioned the quote you know uh

1347
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,619
now every company is a software company

1348
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:15,780
um saty and Della actually didn't say

1349
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,060
that he was quoted in an article well he

1350
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,440
did say that but he didn't come up with

1351
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,440
it he's quoted in an article uh that

1352
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,300
that people grabbed that from that was

1353
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,740
actually coined by a Forbes journalist

1354
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,079
about eight years prior to him one of

1355
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,280
the examples that they used was pretty

1356
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,319
interesting um

1357
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,180
it's kind of getting on my my sphere of

1358
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,500
influence but around the time

1359
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,300
advancements in like industry energy

1360
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,579
Tech uh there are a lot of facets kind

1361
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:39,900
of converging at once compute

1362
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,760
miniaturization you know everyone had a

1363
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,200
laptop at the time probably contributed

1364
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,800
to it but a company developed a 70 000

1365
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,660
mobile instrument that allowed you to

1366
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,420
measure gas concentration around you

1367
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,280
know energy producers

1368
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,619
um whereas you know before this that

1369
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,660
capability was only in the hands of the

1370
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,060
energy producers themselves so as you

1371
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,099
can imagine not every uh company was

1372
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:03,660
just leaping at the opportunity to go

1373
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,060
spend a bunch of money on untrusted Tech

1374
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,859
that would just tell them that they then

1375
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:10,260
needed to spend more money but most did

1376
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,180
because they understood the calculus at

1377
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,640
hand they understood that if they didn't

1378
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,460
just Embrace this technology and use it

1379
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,200
at least experiment with it and explore

1380
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,819
it they knew that someone likely would

1381
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,920
and if they were wrong it could you know

1382
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,980
spell the end of their industry why am I

1383
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,480
saying this this is not a setup for a

1384
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,160
fart joke I promise

1385
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,560
um you can draw a parallel to security

1386
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,900
um there's a lot of effort still in 2022

1387
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,480
of moving to the cloud which is crazy

1388
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,819
but uh there's still a lot of businesses

1389
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,520
that are not embracing comprehensive

1390
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,220
Cloud security not everyone's paying for

1391
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,980
the 70 000 gas leakage tool

1392
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,960
um you know and like I said taking that

1393
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,480
comprehensive approach to Cloud security

1394
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,980
but think about how Reliant you are on

1395
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,319
cloud services I'm sure everyone here

1396
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:57,480
utilizes some sort of cloud-based

1397
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,579
payment processor right well think about

1398
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,619
if that went down for just random some

1399
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,420
sort of random issue it would cause

1400
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,579
panic but if that information was

1401
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:07,319
actually if that system was compromised

1402
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,520
and that information was used against

1403
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,579
you I mean that could level a a company

1404
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,160
depending on how resilient they are

1405
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,780
so the point being here is every

1406
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,880
business needs to understand that due to

1407
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,200
their Reliance on the technology you

1408
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,819
need to also protect it

1409
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,319
um we don't monitor for our own gas

1410
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,380
leakages someone absolutely will

1411
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,780
all right I know I'm uh sure on time a

1412
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,460
couple other things nobody talks You

1413
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,500
know despite this never working

1414
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,480
um the companies continue to work in

1415
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,579
silos so like I said about talking about

1416
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,500
in areas of broader impact earlier

1417
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,359
communicate why you're doing things not

1418
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,700
just hey this is prohibited it's against

1419
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,500
policy but actually you know take the

1420
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,540
time to explain uh why these things

1421
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,640
exist

1422
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,020
EDR everywhere is a blessing and a curse

1423
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,460
uh would I do it differently the next

1424
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,680
time maybe it stopped a ton of attacks

1425
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,619
but it also produced a ton of work so um

1426
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,180
also dealing with the vendor was a

1427
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,280
headache but my point here understand

1428
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,960
how much work is going to be involved

1429
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,180
and factor that into the total cost of

1430
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,099
ownership just to see if the juice is

1431
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:06,540
going to be worth the squeeze of putting

1432
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,819
this on every Internet connected app out

1433
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,460
or endpoint out there

1434
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,440
um you know again I think r d would just

1435
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,940
operate with zero security if left

1436
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,800
unchecked but you need to make sure that

1437
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,420
security is worked into the total cost

1438
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,740
of ownership of anything that you're

1439
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,079
trying to produce uh if you don't

1440
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,700
Security will always be one of the first

1441
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,800
things that has clipped out

1442
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,079
and finally um I'd say the defensibility

1443
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,099
is key

1444
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:30,060
um you're not always going to make the

1445
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,859
right decision every single time but you

1446
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:34,440
can at least create processes that allow

1447
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,300
you to make the right decision given the

1448
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,579
information available at the time

1449
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:40,980
because by the way making a making a

1450
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,540
wrong decision I believe is better than

1451
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,099
making no decision because at least that

1452
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,059
gets you to the right decision quicker

1453
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:50,760
they one of us like one of the product

1454
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,260
teams wanted to develop a tool that

1455
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,700
basically just had RDP open to the

1456
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,520
internet just just straight up and so I

1457
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,619
you know I just said hold the phone uh

1458
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:01,079
we we don't we don't do that in 2022

1459
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,220
anymore

1460
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,319
um and we had to talk about Bastion

1461
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,880
hosts and kind of exploring you know

1462
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,579
kind of a a step in in the right

1463
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,540
direction

1464
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,460
um I'm not sure how meaty that story is

1465
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,260
going to be for you but the amount of

1466
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,359
resistance that I had in the the

1467
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,960
reasoning behind opening up RDP

1468
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,540
to the internet was I was mind-blowing I

1469
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,920
was like what are you what are you

1470
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,780
talking about uh but I would imagine

1471
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,460
working for a state agency you at least

1472
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,400
have some Regulatory Compliance or some

1473
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,040
some standards to to refer to yeah they

1474
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,480
still don't listen

1475
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,280
problems no standards that's right

1476
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,540
embedded resistance yeah well and and

1477
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,859
that was a lot of you know because I

1478
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,619
came in late I came in like we've we've

1479
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,480
always done it this way and we're always

1480
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,880
going to continue doing this way Mr

1481
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,040
Department of no but you know when

1482
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,559
things start to hit the fan uh the tide

1483
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,720
change a little bit great question yeah

1484
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,220
sorry I don't have anything more like

1485
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,240
for you any other questions

1486
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,920
we run out of security questions we can

1487
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,660
move on to Star Trek the Next Generation

1488
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,000
I'll take any one of you

1489
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,760
uh you said earlier that you uh one of

1490
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,520
your quick wins was a 24-hour critical

1491
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,800
response how how did that kind of go or

1492
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,480
what when you got those responses what

1493
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,980
did they look like

1494
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,099
um yeah okay so the question is uh

1495
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:21,720
24-hour critical response would that

1496
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,839
look like I mean again there was no SLA

1497
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:26,280
on when they were going to respond to

1498
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,260
things and if we're being honest there

1499
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,839
wasn't really a healthy communication of

1500
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:32,819
okay we're finding things can you fix

1501
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,440
them so

1502
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,960
um when we would communicate issues to

1503
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,339
them you know a list of vulnerabilities

1504
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,380
we found it was just more of like a oh

1505
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,940
well you know we're gonna have to

1506
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,859
balance this with product releases and

1507
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,780
we're gonna have to you know we'll have

1508
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,220
a meeting about this and we'll get back

1509
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,200
to you on when we're going to fix you

1510
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,640
know heart bleed or something like that

1511
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,520
I mean you know not not like that's a

1512
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,140
specific instance I can either confirm

1513
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,880
nor deny that Harpley it existed in that

1514
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,380
environment but it was stuff like that

1515
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,819
it was just

1516
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:00,780
um

1517
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,079
yeah it it helped us it helped us force

1518
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,000
a measure of at least a response within

1519
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,640
24 hours and then we could talk about

1520
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,140
um how long mitigation was going to look

1521
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,059
like for reasons I can't really get into

1522
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,300
so you just mentioned uh TNG have you

1523
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,240
ever brought up the concept of Lars

1524
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,200
doing a count takeover or user

1525
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,000
impersonation and what mitigating

1526
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
controls would have prevented that

1527
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,280
I think you just wrote my next talk no

1528
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,900
but that's fantastic that's that's

1529
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,640
really good because I I actually always

1530
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,200
talk a bunch of about Star Trek the

1531
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,520
Next Generation but I've never worked

1532
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,559
into one of my talks thank you for for

1533
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,500
creating that no that's perfect

1534
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,520
any other questions

1535
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:47,520
one more all right yeah

1536
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,619
um so you also said that you were

1537
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:51,420
externally communicating a lot of your

1538
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,400
progress what kind of forums were you

1539
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,960
doing that on did you how did you buy

1540
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,700
and kind of make that process work yeah

1541
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,859
great question great question so uh as

1542
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,200
many as many mediums as possible the

1543
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,059
obvious one is email but also we would

1544
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:05,819
communicate out on slack we would host a

1545
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:08,400
regular like security lunch and learns

1546
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,559
you know we were a predominantly remote

1547
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,480
at the time so we'd send out like you

1548
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,359
know GrubHub uh 40 gift cards get people

1549
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:18,300
to show up no seriously I mean we're

1550
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,160
absolutely playing to our audience

1551
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,740
um but those helped out a lot um also

1552
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,359
when we got to actually tracking our

1553
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,400
metrics working with our business

1554
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,079
partners and understanding how to

1555
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,460
display

1556
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,859
um you know time resolution metrics and

1557
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:33,780
um Effectiveness risk reduction stuff

1558
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,640
like that but a good point there would

1559
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,980
be to lean on your external or lean on

1560
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,000
your your partners in other

1561
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,160
organizations because left or on devices

1562
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,079
would be like Ms paint like you know the

1563
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,819
the log for Shell logos that you saw in

1564
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,079
dance

1565
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,260
foreign

1566
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,339
all right

1567
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:57,500
sort of following up to that question

1568
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,180
you hate me

1569
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,319
all good thanks so much for your time

1570
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,000
