00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,280
hey everybody uh thank you yeah you know

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,719
bacon I think you're you're right it's

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,399
like as we as we keep doing this and we

9
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,140
have the the seasons and they're like oh

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,340
yeah it's last con time like that's

11
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,640
great right we we have these moments and

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,020
um we start remembering things and then

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,400
there's also that realization hits in

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
it's like man I have known Baker for a

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,820
really long time that's not good I've

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,400
known Josh for a really long time David

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
and it's like oh geez we're getting old

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,180
man so like that's uh it's great and I'm

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,119
I um I think there's some some things in

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,820
the the slides that maybe will are in my

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,900
talk that will kind of give some

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
perspective of some some thoughts that

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,680
I've been thinking lately about uh um

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,799
about devops devsecops um I kind of

25
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,680
built this to talk to me a you know post

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,659
lunch talk so you know you can kind of

27
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,979
chill hopefully it's hopefully it's good

28
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,479
hopefully there's some hopefully some

29
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,460
things that maybe um will help you in

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,600
your organization

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
uh maybe there'll be things that uh

32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,979
spark interest for for stuff you're

33
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,740
working on or uh you know give you the

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,299
warning signs or things that you want to

35
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,220
look for or maybe you know if you have

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,840
some extra ideas for me or things you

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,659
you see you know unfolding is kind of we

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,820
take this perilous journey of devsecops

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,280
and and uh and what that means uh in in

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
your organizations you know I'd love to

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,299
hear that like I'm trying to

42
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,740
um collect some of those things and just

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,780
see how people are are dealing with that

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,739
so

45
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,140
uh you know thank you uh for for having

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,459
me here

47
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,200
um right now I'm I've started out on my

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
own new adventure I'm working on a a

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,280
startup called dry run security

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,379
um it's it's basically in stealth mode

51
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,520
there's really nothing out there about

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,900
it but

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,540
um I I joke uh like I have I also teach

54
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,220
on LinkedIn learning and I I joke with

55
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,420
my wife I'm like well you know I give

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,340
these like 30 minute talks but then if

57
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,599
people want to listen to like 12 hours

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,220
of content they can just go to LinkedIn

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,599
learning and she's like no one no one

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,640
wants to hear that you know and so

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,340
um and I I agree with her but uh but you

62
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,200
know uh I've teached some classes on

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,720
devops devsecops uh infrastructure

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,599
automation uh CI CD uh all that kind of

65
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,879
stuff so well I think this kind of begs

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,019
the question

67
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,180
is how do

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,060
um how do we do devsecops

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,379
Okay so

70
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,200
I've got a it's a it's a really easy uh

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,819
prescription here for you that's going

72
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,019
to show you how to do this these

73
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,940
instructions uh will get you there so

74
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,140
first

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,040
um you start off with security

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,739
and then you build devsecops

77
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,060
it's great it's like this this has

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,800
worked every single time at every

79
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,599
organization we've tried it at it's uh

80
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,360
it's immediately devsecop success uh

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,319
happens

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:22,920
um

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
and so I I think that's that really gets

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,060
us to thinking like well what do we mean

85
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,800
when we say these these words you know

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,200
because like we have uh you know part of

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,580
maybe part of that being old situations

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,379
like you you start developing like oh

89
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,239
yeah it's really just the same thing we

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,340
were doing five years ago but now we

91
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,019
call it something new because you know

92
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,700
we can get you know better better pay

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,000
better jobs new VC money I I don't know

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
right

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,340
um so you start you start kind of

96
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,900
internalizing this we like to compare

97
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,299
the things that we're doing uh from the

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,519
past and I you know I see I've seen a

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,440
variety of what people you know mean

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,299
when they think about devsecops I think

101
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:58,799
it's important to think about like it's

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,000
not security fixing devops

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,700
um much like it's not devops like fixing

104
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,340
agile it's like an advancement uh of The

105
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,420
Craft

106
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,099
um of what we're trying to do and so we

107
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,560
we think of devops as really uh a

108
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,180
devsecops is really the extension of

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,160
devops but for the benefit and for the

110
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,680
in the inclusiveness of security uh

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,320
being part of that that pipeline so

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,020
um and you may hate the word devsecops

113
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,580
that's okay like you don't it's like

114
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,500
that's not a big deal uh when devops

115
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,139
first came out uh people hated uh the

116
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,639
words devops and it was like there was a

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,960
lot of debate about that and she'll even

118
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,960
call it this and like can can someone be

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,580
a devops and

120
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,400
um Patrick Dubois the uh the guy who

121
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,460
coined the term devops you know he uh

122
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,919
gave a talk a a little while ago I guess

123
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,780
it was in 2019 and he's like you know we

124
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,639
kind of learned that like

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,740
it's okay whatever you call these things

126
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,800
like it doesn't matter if you call it um

127
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,199
uh if you have like the devops or the

128
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,120
devsecops or rugged devops or you're

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,800
calling it digital transformation or

130
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,660
whatever but like we are we are using

131
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,340
these words to kind of show progress and

132
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,660
like there's a lot of the outcome is

133
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,620
what we're is what we're shooting for so

134
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,340
um

135
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,440
okay so how does that is that how does

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
that feel for everybody are we kind of

137
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,580
good on the the definition for devsecops

138
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,880
see some hands or something a shout out

139
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,199
to hurray

140
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,259
okay gotta one hurray it's good I think

141
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,020
oh and a very okay very muted her off

142
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
from this side great

143
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,180
um cool so why why is devsecops not

144
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,500
working why is it not working in many

145
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,820
organizations would anybody say they've

146
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,380
seen like oh yeah devsecops it's doing

147
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,639
really great like we're having a you

148
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,900
know it's we're having a lot of fun

149
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,820
doing it at our organization any harass

150
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,500
for that

151
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,259
no okay I mean you can you can hurt

152
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,580
offer that

153
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,740
um all right so um interesting right

154
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,199
like I would like that's the thing

155
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,120
that's what we're all talking about

156
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,759
um yet um why is it why is it not

157
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,139
working

158
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,419
uh one premise is like maybe maybe

159
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,639
security was never really invited in

160
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,440
into the digital transformation

161
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,139
uh or into the devsec Ops or you know

162
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,840
whatever what have you there

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,340
um does anybody see that like the

164
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,780
digital transformation kind of came and

165
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,759
went in your organization and like

166
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,500
security just kind of got left left on

167
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,580
the side

168
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,860
any I see hands for that now we're now

169
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,900
we're now I see heads nodding and okay

170
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,520
good um

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
cool uh and I think sometimes uh you

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,940
know we'll see that where Security will

173
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,740
have this you know missing notion that

174
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,380
we're the heroes in the story

175
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,840
um and that we're trying to uh there is

176
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,979
sometimes that idea we're trying to fix

177
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,020
it or we're left out so now we got to go

178
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,060
in and like we got so there's a lot of

179
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Miss uh things that happen there

180
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,699
um I like this this quote in the um the

181
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,680
agile application security book which I

182
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,720
find is to be like a really good book uh

183
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,340
for like how you know we're trying to

184
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,539
think about it when people say oh yeah

185
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,860
we're thinking about doing like devops

186
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,539
or devsec Ops or whatever I'm like we'll

187
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,460
just go read agile application security

188
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,319
like start there right like that gives

189
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,539
it gives you a lot of ground uh to cover

190
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,060
in real practical pragmatic ways

191
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,580
um but in it they talk about how uh at

192
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,220
many places uh probably not like it's a

193
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,479
situation like preaching the choir

194
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,419
probably not like the last con crowd but

195
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,580
maybe some of us in here as well like we

196
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,099
have team members or teams that work uh

197
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,479
with a world view where our goal is to

198
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,120
inhibit change as much as possible

199
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,039
and and that's that's a real that's a

200
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,120
real Downer

201
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,720
um

202
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,699
I also include this this quote I've

203
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,919
included it for like years because I

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,840
find this to be incredibly uh

205
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,300
interesting and helpful for us to to

206
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,120
frame uh the conversation on this but in

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,500
the book The tangled web and one of the

208
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,840
openers Michael says uh a security by

209
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,639
risk assessment introduces a dangerous

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,740
fallacy that structured inadequacy is

211
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,660
almost as good as adequacy and that

212
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,460
underfunded security efforts plus risk

213
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,199
management are about as good as properly

214
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,479
funded security work and and you know

215
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,280
that does I read that in the media was

216
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,780
like that does not sit well with me I do

217
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,720
not like that right uh um so I I want to

218
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
make sure sure we got to have like

219
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,960
figure out the risks we got to figure

220
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,880
out how to you know deal with that but

221
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,199
like we still got to do like actual

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,479
engineering work to make it better not

223
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,660
just to do Actuarial uh duties

224
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,960
uh okay we're probably all like uh Swift

225
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,240
on security but uh you know security is

226
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,979
uh less bleeding edge malware research

227
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,440
and more product project manager for

228
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
other people who don't report to you

229
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
um I get some hurrays and head nods out

230
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,979
of that right it's like we've all we've

231
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,800
all been yeah or uh yeah we've all dealt

232
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,320
with that and um you know companies are

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,539
spending uh oh this this one is kind of

234
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,000
like another like premise uh this came

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
out a few years back and I was like ah

236
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,299
you know this is just people who's got

237
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,099
got this figured out here

238
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:45,720
companies are spending a great deal on

239
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
security uh but we still read of you

240
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,680
know massive computer related attacks

241
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,660
and problems and we're clearly something

242
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,640
is wrong there in that equation

243
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,019
like we're the and the root of the

244
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,640
problem is twofold is like we're not

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,440
protecting uh or we're protecting the

246
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
wrong things and we're hurting

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
productivity in the process so which to

248
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,899
me is like that's a that's a double

249
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,360
damning statement for for a group inside

250
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,940
of a larger organization or for or for

251
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,560
even like a discipline where it's like

252
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,019
ah okay at least if like the attacks are

253
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,279
getting better and stuff slowed down

254
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,140
okay but like you know in business like

255
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,519
everything's got to go faster we need

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,959
speed that's you know what we're trying

257
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,220
to do with the digital transformation

258
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,300
anyways

259
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,860
so to

260
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,300
um you know slow down productivity

261
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,600
that's like the that's uh almost a

262
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,160
cardinal sin right in in the in the

263
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,680
transformation uh Journeys here so

264
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
and unsurprisingly like security tools

265
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,800
and the tool chains haven't really

266
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,300
solved all the issues and we have the

267
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,480
they have the tool chains and the

268
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,160
diagrams and every version of this that

269
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,320
you've you've ever imagined

270
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
um and so anyways I started thinking

271
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,220
like what are some of the warning signs

272
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,720
that I've seen

273
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,000
um or that I think are going on in the

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,680
industry that we could sort of point out

275
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,380
and they're not exhaustive and even the

276
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,760
some of the fixes don't necessarily

277
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
correlate to all the warning signs and

278
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,300
all the warning signs in and of

279
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,580
themselves may not really be a bad thing

280
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,680
context is everything on all this stuff

281
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,360
so this is this lab you'll have to do

282
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,740
some like free thinking on this to

283
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,720
figure out like well how bad is that for

284
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,480
us like in my organization like what is

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,060
that was that Ram so okay

286
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,920
uh also at this point you might be

287
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,720
wondering kovid was rough for this guy

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,580
right like he's got a lot of Lego

289
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,860
pictures like what is what was what was

290
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,100
he doing during this whole time right

291
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,959
maybe maybe I don't know maybe you're

292
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,399
not thinking anyways the kids aren't

293
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,019
allowed to touch him I mean that's the

294
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,959
you know that we all know that um

295
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,220
okay

296
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,019
um I thought that was gonna be funnier

297
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,620
so I apologize uh that's where we're at

298
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,240
so there's other talks going on at the

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,560
same time

300
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,899
um security tools uh only being used by

301
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,220
the security team

302
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,100
that's a seems like a common uh pattern

303
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,380
where it could be a warning sign I used

304
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,000
to work at signal Sciences we would

305
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,980
often you know find out like oh okay the

306
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,300
who are the people have access to your

307
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,399
web app firewall oh just like one or two

308
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,079
security people oh how come like the

309
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,399
developers and the operations and the

310
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,480
people that actually build a product

311
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,620
like how come they don't have any

312
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,079
Telemetry from that and so you know

313
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,700
single Sciences kind of connected the

314
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,380
dots for that other tools do that as

315
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,720
well of course but like thinking in that

316
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,820
new way of like what's going on on the

317
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,380
wire defensively being able to answer

318
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,959
the question like am I under attack at

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,060
this right at this moment or the people

320
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,380
who run and support your site should be

321
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,160
able to know that right and we've uh I I

322
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
did some stuff with one of our customers

323
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,700
at the time and they were in a uh in

324
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,320
fintech and they're like yeah we we

325
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,519
didn't know were we having like a

326
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,200
massive account takeover thing and

327
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,820
anyways they were able to work back to

328
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,079
like what's going on in the business and

329
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,000
they were saying oh oh it looked like it

330
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,320
was but it wasn't and we were able to

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,420
make that that understanding uh we're

332
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,440
able to come to that understanding

333
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,420
really quickly because of wiring both

334
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,160
kind of the the system metric

335
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,959
observability stuff and the security

336
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,000
things together and as well as like some

337
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,220
of the business uh you know things that

338
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,440
are happening so be able to expose that

339
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
data I think that's that's a prime uh

340
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
prime target number one for security

341
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,260
folks in the in the devsecops

342
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,560
transformation uh to looking or kind of

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,600
like 1A is like also kind of avoiding

344
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
the hidden Silo I think we can also be

345
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,920
in this state where we're like oh cool

346
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,660
that's like the devsecops tool or the

347
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,279
devsecops team or the whatever and then

348
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,040
like we've just made a new a new Silo a

349
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
new place uh to separate off

350
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,260
that's not unique to devsecops that was

351
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,640
the thing that we actually did in devops

352
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,779
a lot like

353
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,279
um I remember

354
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,720
um you know speaking about how old we

355
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,880
are it's like eight or ten years ago

356
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,459
it's like oh great we have a devops team

357
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,200
and you're like cool

358
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,600
um and uh and you know Boyd's Boyd I

359
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
knows has seen a lot of this as well

360
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,180
where it's like what what does that

361
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,380
really mean to you like we would like

362
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,760
try to go through that process of like

363
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
how does how did you well how did you

364
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
think that was a good idea right not

365
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,680
saying that

366
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,899
um that you can't have models that work

367
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,880
in that way but you kind of dig deeper

368
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,500
and it's like they took the sysadmins

369
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,200
gave them a new title and boom like

370
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,180
they're doing the devops right and it's

371
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,459
like ah you might have skipped some some

372
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,740
pages there in the uh in the digital

373
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,720
transformation uh process or whatever

374
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,760
you know whatever flavor of that you

375
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
know brand you prefer at your

376
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
organization

377
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,519
um number two uh okay you have a change

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,839
Advisory Board

379
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,940
fair enough like you have one of those I

380
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,920
generally that's probably a warning sign

381
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,680
uh that the devsecops uh transformation

382
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,779
or digital transformation is not not

383
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,519
really working for you

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,279
um see uh visible Ops uh Gene Kim

385
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,459
uh book uh okay another one is uh

386
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,180
security versus it or it versus business

387
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,940
this kind of unfolds in many ways I

388
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,260
think it's often whenever like whenever

389
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,880
you hear people around your organization

390
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,200
start saying like well how does it

391
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,180
provide value for the business it's like

392
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,220
ding ding that should maybe have some

393
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,200
warning signs that you haven't really

394
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,300
done the digital transformation you're

395
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,920
still kind of in this like service

396
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,459
expense contractor model of I.T

397
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,779
um I have a recommendation for a book on

398
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:55,980
that that later I'm trying not to

399
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,200
problem solve all these just yet but

400
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,399
um that's something to watch out for

401
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,040
because like that that shows to me that

402
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,200
it is not really core to to what the

403
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,060
business is doing it's sort of this uh

404
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,579
you know contractual separated arm uh

405
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,680
that's that's a real real common one to

406
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,459
have

407
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,920
another one is your deploys to

408
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,540
production uh take longer than five

409
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,399
minutes that may seem like a really

410
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,660
short amount of time

411
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,880
um depending on on where you're at and I

412
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,500
know that that can be this is this is

413
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,940
one of those like gray area like could

414
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,339
it be a warning sign maybe not but uh

415
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,639
developers like psychologically or not

416
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,660
psychologically that's not the right

417
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,600
word but um we start making trade-offs

418
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,579
at like what we're going to commit and

419
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,139
how we're going to work with the system

420
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,019
at about five to ten minutes a different

421
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,519
studies show different things on this

422
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,139
but five minutes is a pretty good

423
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,519
barrier but like once it starts getting

424
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,399
too slow to run the deploys we start

425
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,139
saying ah okay let's see let's let's

426
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,339
commit all these stuff together we'll

427
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,959
batch it all together oh let's wait till

428
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,000
the end of the day to to deploy that and

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,740
then like that turns into well it's no

430
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,420
deploys are taking an hour so let's do

431
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,920
that weekly or something we start kind

432
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,320
of gradually devolving into this kind of

433
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,660
state where even though we may have the

434
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,399
skills and the technology and it's

435
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,380
software and it's easy to it should

436
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,300
theoretically be easy to deploy changes

437
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,220
in software we continue to make it

438
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,139
harder by batching all these things and

439
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,839
adding more more complexity together at

440
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,880
the same time

441
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,620
um yeah this crowd probably knows this

442
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,360
right like is compliance and audit time

443
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,920
is it painful of course there's always

444
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,139
some a bit of of pain associated with

445
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,760
this or some bit of process associated

446
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,920
with it but like our people when you're

447
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,000
it's like compliance time is like

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,380
everybody putting in their their notice

449
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,579
for vacation and trying to get out of

450
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,139
Dodge or like you're like I'm I'm

451
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,459
quitting you know and going somewhere

452
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,420
else

453
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,279
um I I know uh several people in our

454
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,839
field that are like yeah I'm going

455
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,940
through like several Audits and I'm uh

456
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,980
I'm gonna quit you know it's like well

457
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,660
fair you know I've been there right

458
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,519
there's a there's a time I was going

459
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,800
through PCI and I was like I think I I

460
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,180
didn't really like this company I think

461
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,500
I might quit right because this is

462
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,839
pretty pretty horrible so

463
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,560
um

464
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,480
cool uh I don't know does that

465
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,980
resonating if everything is resonating

466
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,779
or is anybody's like this guys was

467
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,199
talking about it's kind of bright so

468
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,079
we'll we'll assume uh all is good or uh

469
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,220
hopefully I haven't made anybody too

470
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,300
upset

471
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,220
um and then there's also the uh the scan

472
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,199
everything uh fantasy and trying to

473
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,360
secure all the things and that takes

474
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,199
many many forms um so okay

475
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,880
so those are some of the warning signs

476
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,399
and now what do we do if we say oh we

477
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,019
really want to do devsecops we really

478
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,480
want this to be uh kind of a new way

479
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,760
that we're going to do work work

480
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,100
um I mean come on the Lego pictures are

481
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,440
you're you're like there's a lot there's

482
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,060
quite a few this is getting weirder

483
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,540
right oh good uh so first we have to

484
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,540
identify the the people a ratio uh the

485
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,339
people mismatch ratio and the silos

486
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,459
inside of organization so uh also this

487
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,560
has been published many times over now

488
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,079
but the 100 developers to 10 operations

489
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,480
to One Security person that is a model

490
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,820
that just is not really a scalable a

491
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,079
scalable model

492
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,880
um and so if you're if you're thinking

493
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,800
even sometimes we're like oh we'll do

494
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,199
this the embedded security program

495
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,419
um maybe like like you got to be you

496
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,619
gotta experiment with how this is going

497
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,540
to work because as we all know like

498
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,119
there's there's we we're we don't have

499
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,740
enough security people to fill the seats

500
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,720
that we even though we do have so we're

501
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,740
like we're not going to change this to

502
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,780
like just hiring

503
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,099
um probably

504
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,540
you know not going to change this any

505
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,520
other way than like really

506
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,020
um you know figuring out ways where like

507
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,240
security gets brought into the into the

508
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,679
process and is bringing the Automation

509
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,600
and the tooling and other pieces and

510
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,179
processes in so

511
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:33,900
um

512
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,580
oh yeah and here's here's a book that I

513
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,840
recommend if you find yourself in that

514
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
model with that one problem where it's

515
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,080
like well we're we're always talking

516
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,059
about like it adding value and not being

517
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,160
part of the business or whatever if you

518
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,020
find that I would recommend um I would

519
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,480
recommend this book a seat at the table

520
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,520
uh kind of discusses like how to how to

521
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,960
go through that if you're undergoing

522
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,940
digital transformation or if you're uh

523
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,500
or if you're being left out of digital

524
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,360
transformation in it or I think we can

525
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,000
also apply it into security uh then this

526
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,440
is uh this would be really helpful for

527
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,260
you uh to read and check that out

528
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,100
okay number two uh building uh devsecops

529
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,539
people or

530
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,220
um kind of focusing on the on the the

531
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,320
ways that each part of the dev and the

532
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,360
SEC and the Ops can like learn how to

533
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,400
play it together and coexist in a

534
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,140
meaningful way so I think for security

535
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,299
this is a message that's uh probably to

536
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,160
this crowd not too unfamiliar right this

537
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,620
is the the Jason Chan Netflix model of

538
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,200
build the paved Road I know many people

539
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
in this in this room have already

540
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
thought about this and already working

541
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
on some of these things like making

542
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,980
security normal making security uh free

543
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,360
if you're using that part of the system

544
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,299
uh it was interesting that we it took a

545
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,160
company like Netflix to help us kind of

546
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,740
popularize this idea where a company

547
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,600
that essentially has you know no rules

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
and no processes and it's like just wild

549
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,500
west really but then they said well but

550
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,780
if you use the main paved Road you're

551
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,700
good if you don't you're gonna have a

552
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,340
problem but that that idea has really uh

553
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,960
taken root where if you're a developer

554
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,980
and you're like I want to get security

555
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,840
well I want to get it for free we even

556
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,580
see like our uh

557
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,559
um you know places like GitHub and get

558
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,120
lab and stuff they're baking Security in

559
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,039
just as much as possible we can give

560
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,160
security free just as part of part of

561
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,660
the developers experience inside of our

562
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,900
organizations that's a win so security

563
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,640
look for opportunities to do that right

564
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,580
take take old tools find new tools find

565
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,220
new ways to make those connections

566
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,380
uh message I like to tell to developers

567
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,320
is like find application hooks where you

568
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
can hook into security so whether that's

569
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,460
through like you know feature flagging

570
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,220
or you're or you have like a you know

571
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,380
certain Uris that kind of like give you

572
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,260
some extra Telemetry on the application

573
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,460
make sure that there are self-running

574
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,900
you know make sure you're self-writing

575
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,120
Baseline tooling kind of like pull from

576
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,160
the security team instead of waiting you

577
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,960
know to a later date where you're like

578
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,000
told like oh yeah you have these like

579
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
cross-site scripting or whatever

580
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
vulnerabilities that you might have

581
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,340
instead like at least know hey by the

582
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,559
time I I get my app out the door I'm

583
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,480
good for like a baseline of stuff like I

584
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,860
know that I don't have like Secrets

585
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,200
baked in and and I've you know run some

586
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,480
just off-the-shelf you know scanners or

587
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,179
something like that right so that's a

588
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,580
that's what developers can can work for

589
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,100
and then uh to operations uh looking for

590
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,260
ways to to add that Telemetry into the

591
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,700
observability stack I gave that a little

592
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,320
example of how we how we were doing that

593
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,880
at signal Sciences to think about how to

594
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,679
how to wire those together of course

595
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,020
like uh contrast and other folks are

596
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,820
doing that as well

597
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,880
um but it is it is a way to uh in inside

598
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,340
of your your metrics and whether you're

599
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,840
looking at you know your datadog

600
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,160
dashboard or whatever but you're also

601
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,380
able to see like oh scans that are scans

602
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,299
that are being run you know attacks that

603
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:40,559
have been fired like you're able to kind

604
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,260
of put all that into the you know I

605
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,760
guess with it really I mean we've heard

606
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,039
it say single pane of glass like how

607
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,140
many times I don't know but um but

608
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,220
actually stitching those things together

609
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,160
for Real uh not not in kind of this uh

610
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,480
separate thing where you're kind of in

611
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,220
like an operation Center but the thing

612
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,720
that makes sense where you can make

613
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,679
correlation across uh across events here

614
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
okay

615
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,919
um cool how are we tracking we good it

616
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,660
was like is lunch kicking in are we good

617
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,880
any hurrays out there still worried

618
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
about the Lego situation

619
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,179
it's gonna get worse I just want to tell

620
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,220
you that so cool

621
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,679
um next next up is evalu your CI CD

622
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,360
pipeline so

623
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,299
um you know I have like um I have stuff

624
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,679
that I think about like the tools that

625
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,539
you can put in place and of course we

626
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,160
all have different structures for how

627
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,559
we're how we're doing CI CD

628
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,780
um but Shannon Leets gave this talk

629
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,159
um and uh you know Shannon's been a

630
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,140
speaker here before and I really liked

631
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,700
it when she was talking about

632
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,679
um she at uh at Intuit she would take

633
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
her Pipeline and then

634
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,220
um there's no tools on this list but

635
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,900
it's like questions to ask at certain

636
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,360
phases uh phases of the pipeline I

637
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,679
started thinking yeah it's a pretty it's

638
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:49,500
a pretty good idea because no one has an

639
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,320
identical environment in this room

640
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,419
um much less just across the industry so

641
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,520
how do we instead

642
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,140
um think about the types of questions we

643
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,580
want to ask so

644
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,919
without further Ado uh let's go through

645
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,900
a few questions at a few phases of the

646
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,820
pipeline and just see if any of those

647
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,260
spark any interest for you but this

648
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,580
these are these are supposed to be like

649
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,020
conversation starters to help with on

650
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,240
your team so our developers using

651
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,620
security locally before it gets to the

652
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,140
CI system in the developed phase uh are

653
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,179
we practicing good code hygiene and

654
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,980
coding practices just even like just

655
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,419
like linting you know are we doing doing

656
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,460
that kind of stuff uh any sort of secret

657
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,860
uh you know uh control or keeping

658
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,140
secrets out of Version Control that's

659
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,059
good okay so the next phase is one

660
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,740
that's not on many pipelines I like it

661
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,120
because it you know we got to think

662
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
about the the sca stuff and just like

663
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,020
what what other stuff we're building in

664
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,799
here

665
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,360
um so what have I put in my app like

666
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,159
dependencies or third-party connections

667
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,440
that are making me vulnerable uh am I

668
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,240
publishing a bill of materials with my

669
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,280
with my application

670
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,140
um I I probably should be doing that

671
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,360
especially if I can

672
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,140
um

673
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,200
cool and let's see build uh am I am I

674
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,299
testing for security uh low hanging

675
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,280
fruit uh am I arming my Pipeline with

676
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,620
attack tools to exercise the application

677
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,720
and have I validated the previous two

678
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,159
steps so the rest of the stuff has

679
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,840
happened in in your development

680
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,480
environment maybe on check-in uh it

681
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,159
depends on where you put your your uh

682
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,320
software composition stuff in in The

683
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,419
Inheritance phase but anyways you want

684
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,559
to make sure you're validating so you

685
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,000
have a clean record of like yeah all

686
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,860
that stuff's been done I rerun my

687
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,340
linters and whatever so

688
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,659
uh yeah agile application security book

689
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,039
to bring them back into this they say

690
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,720
that it should be the goal to come up

691
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,159
with automated tests to check for all

692
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,780
the security configurations and behavior

693
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,400
and then execute that every time the

694
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,500
system is built and deployed uh have a

695
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,240
have a course on that at the LinkedIn

696
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,500
learning

697
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,200
um and then the deployment phase so what

698
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,520
what secrets are needed to move my

699
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,140
application from development into

700
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,600
production am I testing for compliance

701
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
on every deploy could I even assert

702
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,559
anything close to that is there a

703
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,000
reasonable mechanism to push changes

704
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,559
into production that's like repeatable

705
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,659
reliable all those things some of these

706
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,760
are just like good devops practices and

707
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,860
then like we can sometimes get into oh

708
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,919
like security can really take part in

709
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,919
that just like just like devops has done

710
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,140
uh and it's interesting to me still like

711
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,120
you know going back to that well in the

712
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
beginning of devops you didn't even

713
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,080
think of like CID CD pipelines is like

714
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,760
the most important thing like we were

715
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,400
just concerned with like can can like

716
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,440
the infrastructure be codified in a way

717
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,659
that like a developer can interact with

718
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,880
it over time people like have kind of

719
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,520
said oh devops that's uh that's Jenkins

720
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,980
right or whatever it's your CI CD or

721
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,559
your Chef plus that or it's interesting

722
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,539
how like our our idea of like what

723
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,039
something is changes over time and I

724
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,600
think we're seeing that growth as for

725
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,299
for uh devsecops as well so

726
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,520
in the operation phase are are we under

727
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,960
attack at the moment I mentioned some

728
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,640
stuff like that do we know what

729
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,380
attackers are going for uh when they are

730
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,539
when they are coming in or uh can we

731
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,039
turn off stuff independently so we have

732
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,440
kill switches uh if we're actively being

733
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,940
attacked can we shut down uh certain

734
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,440
components

735
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,880
um are we doing any security chaos

736
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,700
experiments uh to understand like if I

737
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,100
if this set of actions happen what what

738
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,840
security prevention tools and mechanisms

739
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,940
you know come in place and like can we

740
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,620
even look at that in any sort of game

741
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,080
day exercise or any way to to look at

742
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,400
that

743
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,100
uh all right cool the next piece here is

744
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,500
building a sharing culture so Patrick

745
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,419
Dubois who I mentioned a little bit

746
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,480
earlier the coined the term devops but

747
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,600
um way back in uh 2014 back when um

748
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,700
people were saying devops with like uh

749
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,320
you know quoted fingers and if you still

750
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,480
think that that's okay too but

751
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,340
um but it was like oh yeah the devops

752
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,320
right and and there's there's a lot of

753
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,179
questions of like could this survive

754
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,340
it's fine for a startup the thinking was

755
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,960
at the time that's very fine for a

756
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,299
startup when you're 10 people but it's

757
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,799
not going to work in the Enterprise like

758
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,480
and that was that was like the thought

759
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,500
so cutter it Journal uh test Patrick and

760
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,779
one of our friends Ernest Muller who's

761
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,520
not out here today but

762
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
um he contributed to the uh to the uh

763
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
to the journal on that but it was really

764
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,360
focusing on like how does devops make

765
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,679
and I thought it was the first piece

766
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,880
that really kind of tackled that

767
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,980
question of like how is devops going to

768
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,299
make the move to the Enterprise because

769
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,760
it's like it's like it yeah right at the

770
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,140
time it was like it was a bunch of bunch

771
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,120
of startups or or

772
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,340
um uh you know places like Etsy or

773
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,020
Netflix or whatever that just didn't

774
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,700
really have like the

775
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,740
um you've been out of bank they're not

776
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,299
Healthcare they're not oil right so it's

777
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,279
like what can this is really gonna work

778
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,919
you know for craft Goods sure but is

779
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,419
this going to work for for a real

780
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,919
business and that was that was the

781
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,320
question so in that environment in that

782
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,299
time Patrick said this and I think it's

783
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,679
still really relevant for us today he

784
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,480
says culture is the most important

785
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,220
aspect to devops succeeding in the

786
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,880
Enterprise

787
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,860
and so that that gets us thinking like

788
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,140
what what does culture mean what is it

789
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,179
what does it mean for security what does

790
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:46,860
it mean as we think about how security

791
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,779
plays in the devops space and gets in

792
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,880
into devsecops as we continue to see

793
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,640
this uh journey across our organization

794
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,679
so yeah it's having the same under

795
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
similar understanding uh trying to share

796
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,659
in the same language trying to come up

797
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,340
with similar views or ways to to look at

798
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,320
problems together putting in

799
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,240
collaborative tooling that allows allows

800
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,860
the teams to take place so some of that

801
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,440
stuff um you probably already have some

802
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,760
of it as you're thinking about it's like

803
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
well sometimes when I have a meeting

804
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,720
with you know such and such team we we

805
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,820
sort of like talk past each other and

806
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,620
maybe you even know like yeah sometimes

807
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,700
they do it intentionally because you

808
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,260
know they're always like a real pain to

809
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,299
deal with right and uh you know we've

810
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,460
all been there but trying to find ways

811
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,200
to to bridge the culture Gap inside your

812
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,760
organization that's actually the hardest

813
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,620
work of all this to do and it's one of

814
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,600
those things that's uh probably the most

815
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
uh worthwhile so uh security is only

816
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,279
successful If it creates learning

817
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,460
feedback from developers to for

818
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,500
developers from all the operational data

819
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,539
and everything kind of in between like

820
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,919
they were trying to provide learning

821
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:49,320
environments because the model has

822
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,480
really shifted right like my my

823
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,340
three-tier or whatever tier application

824
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,000
now looks like this and I'm like ah this

825
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,620
is not this is not good is anybody

826
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,080
living with this reality right now

827
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,700
yeah no any harass or size or slow claps

828
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,679
right it's like yeah we're we're seeing

829
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,020
like the the breakup of all of our all

830
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,480
of our uh our monolith applications or

831
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,520
or three-tier or however however you're

832
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,900
doing it before it's like I'm you're

833
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,419
probably going to a structure uh place

834
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,820
like this with the split up of all the

835
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,620
services

836
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,380
uh okay another one is inviting uh I.T

837
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,320
risk and audit uh to the party

838
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
um

839
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,960
um so two I won't get into the the full

840
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,000
um the full details on this one but uh

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,440
if you're thinking about this like

842
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,720
visible Ops is a great book uh the

843
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,400
investment's unlimited uh book that just

844
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,679
came out is uh is highly recommended in

845
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,179
in here some of the stuff that it

846
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,940
Revolution uh put out um

847
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,039
uh what's the name of that it was

848
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,840
anyways I can see some links if you have

849
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,580
other stuff but I think uh Investments

850
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,860
unlimited is uh is the right right place

851
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,779
to look at the moment

852
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,580
as much as you can try to match the

853
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,320
Cadence of developers uh to increase

854
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,559
flow so putting security tooling where

855
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,360
the match is what developers are doing

856
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,419
so developers need stuff that's CI CD

857
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,360
native they need meaningful results of

858
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,860
course they don't need a bunch of

859
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,779
inactionable you know tickets in jira or

860
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,580
whatever uh they need uh you know

861
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,080
replayable findings

862
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,740
um uh you know as as things get old or

863
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,659
get on uh inside of an application it's

864
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,760
continuing in development and especially

865
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,740
as you're kind of Distributing into

866
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,899
multiple like microservices and apis and

867
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,460
calling third-party stuff you start

868
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,720
becoming less concerned about the

869
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,059
injection problems and more about abuse

870
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:38,520
and misuse cases so

871
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,220
um be looking for ways to to Target that

872
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,039
and then uh try to you know as much as

873
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,320
you can put all that output and Target

874
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,000
it into places where developers are

875
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,860
already working and living so uh from

876
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,799
from slack to jira to GitHub to you know

877
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,140
whatever it is in your organization so

878
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,659
okay so that's that's my advice for the

879
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,360
the the budding uh devsecop or person

880
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,340
who's trying to take on the the devsecop

881
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,860
adventure uh this is identify the people

882
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,100
ratio mismatch and silos build devsecops

883
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,799
people evaluate your CI CD pipeline for

884
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,200
security build a sharing culture uh

885
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
invite it risk and audit and match the

886
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,260
Cadence of developers to increase

887
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,120
overall flow

888
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,880
um so that's that's the talk you know um

889
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,820
I can I can handle some questions and uh

890
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
if you want to if you have any questions

891
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,539
or you want to copy the slides I have a

892
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,120
Popple on here which is a like a a fun

893
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,520
thing that I'm I'm trying out but uh

894

903
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,240
lunch and you're like ah maybe maybe the

904
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,340
devsec cops I don't know so

905
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,000
um yeah sure

906
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,659
how dare you this is my partner oh wait

907
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:17,640
so like like it risk thinks it's their

908
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,559
party or their party yeah yeah yeah

909
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,419
that's a good question I I don't know

910
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,440
does anybody have any does everybody

911
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,000
understand the question like how do you

912
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,799
bring in I.T risk and audit into the

913
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,260
into the devsecops journey yeah does

914
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,120
anybody have any like success stories of

915
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,658
how that's happened

916
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,520
I I think that for some of the things

917
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,860
that I try to try to look at

918
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,960
um is you know what are their main

919
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,820
objections right like and sometimes it's

920
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,960
like

921
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,760
uh

922
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,559
sometimes you gotta find like the right

923
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,600
audit uh auditor that's gonna like work

924
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,100
with you on this and there's there's

925
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,620
there is a change going in that in that

926
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,799
uh group of folks um where they're

927
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,740
starting to see like oh like I devops

928
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,659
and devsecops like all the all the

929
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,159
digital exhaust that comes out of that

930
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,559
like those are really good artifacts

931
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,720
that we can you know assert compliance

932
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,940
and on through you know um but then

933
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,919
there's some folks that uh maybe focus a

934
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,000
little bit less on that and they focus

935
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,500
more on like your HR controls or your

936
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,659
whatever right so I'd say try to find

937
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,539
those that are more interested in that

938
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,020
in the the in the the former category

939
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,220
um bringing them on

940
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,240
um

941
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,299
I think the the visible Ops uh stuff and

942
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,279
and then um Gene's book visible app

943
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:34,260
security had a lot of helpful things to

944
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,700
say about that

945
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,440
um and I'm just I'm spacing on the I

946
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,480
don't know boy dear Boyd are you where

947
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,940
are you I can't see you here but uh I'm

948
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,919
gonna see in there I guess he's not

949
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,520
um but uh so that is another uh spot and

950
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,020
if you send me an email I'll dig out

951
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,580
there's a there's a white paper that's

952
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,559
maybe like five years old but like how

953
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,760
to how to make some of that change

954
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,620
inside of an organization that could be

955
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,539
helpful as well they came out of it

956
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,940
Revolution but that predated that

957
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,799
um that book um investment's unlimited

958
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,320
and so like that may be the more of a

959
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,260
canonical example for you now so yeah

960
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,840
foreign

961
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,260
anything else

962
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,519
okay well hey I'm around so hit me up

963
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,019
and uh thanks for thanks for all this

964
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:23,220
time today

965
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,329
[Applause]
