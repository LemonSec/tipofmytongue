00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,180
super excited to talk to you about this

7
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,820
topic of security Champions share a

8
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,379
little bit about my journey kind of how

9
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,239
what I've experienced in running

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,339
security Champions programs a little bit

11
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,180
about me

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,580
so I'm the chief security officer and

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,460
co-founder of security journey and I've

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,840
been in the world of security for 25

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,820
plus years and had a chance to do a lot

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,460
of different things in in my time I

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,080
spent 10 years at Cisco I'll tell you

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
some more of that story as we go forward

19
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,439
because some of that story was running

20
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,960
the security Advocates at Cisco

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,000
and I'm also the co-lead of the owasp

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,740
triangle chapter that's in Raleigh North

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
Carolina which is where my home base is

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,939
so I've got a podcast called the

25
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,340
application security podcast I know it's

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,860
not the best marketing name but you do

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,479
understand exactly what we're going to

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,920
talk about on there so we've done about

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,400
200 episodes so far interviewed lots of

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,720
people that are even speaking at this

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,060
conference and understand kind of what

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,460
makes them tick and what makes them be

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,079
successful I'm also a big fan of Twitter

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,880
so feel free to reach out to me there as

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
well

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
and uh just one one quick plug

37
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,020
um so my company security Journey we

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,000
have a deal with OAS where if you're an

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,360
OAS member you can get access to a

40
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
version of our product that's included

41
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,819
with your OS membership so all we use a

42
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,500
lot of O wasp sources as you could

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,080
imagine for our content and so we we

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,879
provide all that content back to OAS

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,200
members through that so you can check

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
that out as well but you have to be an

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,220
oauth member to get access to that

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,020
so here's the agenda that I have for us

49
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,760
today I'm gonna on the first three I'm

50
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,620
just gonna spend a real short amount of

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,760
time and I'm going to spend the bulk of

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
my time on what I'm calling the security

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,420
Champion framework but before we get

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,840
there I want to talk about what I see is

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,340
the challenges that exist without

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,860
Champions I want to then talk about the

57
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,900
need for Champions and the goal that I

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,239
see and then the value proposition what

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,700
you'll get out of doing this and then

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,840
like I said we'll talk about the

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,040
framework and I'll show you how the

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,540
framework kind of comes together but

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,580
first help me understand who I'm talking

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,560
to in the room here so if you have an

65
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,060
existing security Champions program

66
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,760
right now raise your hand let me see

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,040
okay good number of people okay if

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,180
you're if you're getting ready to start

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,700
a new program and you're here to kind of

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,560
try to figure out some things you can do

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,879
raise your hand let me see if we got any

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,920
of those folks okay and if you hate

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,680
security Champions programs please I'm

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,060
doing this for my friend these are in

75
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,340
the back here who is is happily we've

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,260
had many debates about

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,260
um security Champions Pro versus con so

78
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,700
um yeah just had to throw that in for

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,540
him

80
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,220
so that that's helpful for me though to

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,540
understand where folks are coming from

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,879
so let's talk for a second about what

83
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,260
life looks like if we don't have

84
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,780
security champions

85
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,120
think of all the different pieces of

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,040
your application security program all

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,620
the different things that you have to do

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,360
if you don't have security Champions

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,879
security has to be responsible for for

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
dealing with all these things

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,540
yeah you could say well the we're going

92
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,220
to make developers responsible for them

93
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,080
but if you have a world where developers

94
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,700
don't know that much about security yet

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,040
these things are falling back on you as

96
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,019
a security team and so look at that I

97
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,060
mean you've got security user stories

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,319
you've got results from all the

99
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,060
different types of tools the four letter

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,879
and three letter tools from SCA to SAS

101
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,060
and Daft and CVA you got security tasks

102
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,980
broken search pen test results security

103
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,840
chaos engineering experiment failures

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
all of these things if we don't have

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,260
Champions dispersed throughout the

106
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,358
business to help us deal with these

107
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,880
things then we as security have to deal

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,800
with them ourselves

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,320
and so just a little bit about my um

110
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,360
kind of my Champion origin story so like

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
I said I was at Cisco for about 11 years

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,580
and uh six of those years were being

113
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,800
part of the Central Security team that

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,860
was focused on securing all of Cisco's

115
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,860
products

116
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,960
and like with a lot of security Advocate

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
security Champion programs The Cisco one

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,800
went through a number of

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,860
ups and up and down and so what would

120
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,440
happen and what happened with 1.0 2.03.0

121
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
I was responsible for the 3p 3.0

122
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,479
instance of it but with 1.0 and 2.0

123
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,460
someone would take over the program they

124
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,020
would get excited about it the program

125
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,639
would go up they'd get lots of people

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,560
and then what would happen

127
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,660
the person would leave and go take

128
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,580
another job and then

129
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,259
it would fall back down to almost

130
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,240
nothing and then at Cisco the second

131
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
second another person that I worked with

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,259
on my team kind of took it drove it up

133
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,820
and then he left

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,100
and we had some attrition in the overall

135
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,960
approach and then I picked it up with

136
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,720
3.0 and I picked it up with really a

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
ragtag group of uh of individuals I had

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
about 20 people left at that point and

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,840
these people love security they were

140
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,060
developers testers you know in some of

141
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,800
the different technical roles across the

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
different business units and they loved

143
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,060
security enough to to step forward and

144
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,740
be a part of what what I was continuing

145
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
to do

146
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,580
but I mean in those early days I

147
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,820
Cisco is is in San Jose California has

148
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,160
about 35 buildings I literally went to

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,960
San Jose on a trip I made a list of

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,340
people that I wanted to try to get to

151
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,860
become Advocates and I went Cube to Cube

152
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,960
and I literally knocked on people's Cube

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,300
walls and said hi I'm Chris I'm starting

154
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,860
the security Advocates again and we need

155
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,600
you to be a part of it you know and a

156
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,620
lot of people gave me a lot of weird

157
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,360
looks like why is this the why is there

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,979
a solicitor in the building

159
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,320
uh I'm like I have a badge you know I

160
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
work here as well

161
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,080
um but that was how I really jump

162
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
started and and got it going again and

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
so

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,419
all that to say what I'm going to share

165
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,979
with you in this framework is based on

166
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,380
my real life experience and experiences

167
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,180
I've learned from you know hearing from

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,560
other people other people that I know

169
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,020
that run these types of programs so

170
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
um most of us probably know this already

171
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,500
but when I think about a champion what

172
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,199
I'm really looking for is that one Spark

173
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,300
that one little spark of interest about

174
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
security

175
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,780
if I can get that spark then I can pour

176
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,000
into that person and we as a program can

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
pour to that person to help them really

178
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,600
grow and and become excited about

179
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,100
security

180
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,080
if I have somebody who's just like eh

181
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,240
they're making me do this it just never

182
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,500
works out as well for that person

183
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,660
because they don't have any interest or

184
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,400
any passion in what's happening

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
and then security Community for me it's

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,340
you know let's bring together this

187
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,440
virtual team of people from across the

188
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,539
business and many different roles I'm

189
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,860
going to refer to these folks going

190
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,620
forward as product adjacent okay so my

191
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,479
everybody who is anywhere near the

192
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,240
product is product adjacent so from the

193
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
developers the testers the sres the

194
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,639
program managers the product managers

195
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,620
everybody they're all product adjacent

196
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
and so I want them all to have

197
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,580
visibility and and a role in what we're

198
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,840
doing as a security community

199
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,080
yeah sure

200
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,940
yes definitely yeah good question yeah

201
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,220
so when I when I in in the Pro the way I

202
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,660
describe doing this the way I think is

203
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,060
the best way to do it you you should

204
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,759
have more than just developers because

205
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,979
at the end of the day everyone who's in

206
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,960
that product adjacent category we're all

207
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
responsible for the security of the

208
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
product we just have different roles and

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,380
when you get a product manager who who

210
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,900
understands the the risk and the threats

211
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,120
and the needs for security they're never

212
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,400
going to fight you again on on adding

213
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,259
security focused user stories they're

214
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,940
going to be an advocate for it in the

215
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,080
planning process they're gonna be like

216
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
oh whoa whoa we gotta set some time

217
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
aside here in these next Sprints to deal

218
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,360
with these security user stories because

219
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,039
we got some functionality we got to get

220
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,979
you know re-added in so yeah

221
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,259
um but just so you know this I mean

222
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,599
my what I've put forth in this framework

223
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,740
is descriptive it's not always

224
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,020
prescriptive so not everything that I

225
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,580
say today is going to be applicable in

226
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,620
what you're doing in in your Champions

227
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,240
program but I'm just going to throw out

228
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,500
everything I know and all the

229
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,659
experiences that I've had and and you

230
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,039
can pick and choose which ones you think

231
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,919
are going to work best for you

232
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,479
so when I think about the successful

233
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,919
champion

234
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,200
few different few different things that

235
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,779
I'm hoping are going to be developed in

236
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,220
that individual

237
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,720
so the first one is foundational

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,300
knowledge right I need I need my

239
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,220
Champions to have a basic understanding

240
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,620
of product and application security all

241
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,360
the way down to really the literal

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,980
Basics the thing the things that we

243
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,380
think of as basics you know the CIA

244
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,240
Triad yeah it's it's in every

245
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,399
certification who knows why but like

246
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,320
even the basic kind of things like that

247
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,640
I want everybody I want people to know

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,959
what is authentication what is

249
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,060
authorization what are these basic

250
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,580
building blocks and then because then I

251
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,680
can build on top of that

252
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,600
now I talked about that spark of passion

253
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,339
already that's that's crucial if they

254
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,660
don't have that spark it's really tough

255
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,000
to to take somebody on a long-term

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,959
Journey where they're going to really

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,820
dive in and get into this

258
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,279
I want them to understand the attacks

259
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,720
that that the things they build are

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,700
going to be going up against I also want

261
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,860
them to acknowledge which this isn't as

262
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,180
much of a challenge now as it used to be

263
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,880
but I I want them to to realize what I

264
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,860
build gets pushed into production and

265
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,360
then attackers hammer it all day long

266
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,459
trying to find a way into it you know

267
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,140
and it's like I said that's that's been

268
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,120
a transition over time and I also want

269
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,500
them to know how to utilize tools and

270
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,720
processes that we have I want them to be

271
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,880
enablers that can they can help those

272
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,339
around them be be use the tools

273
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,019
interpret the results once again I'm

274
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,540
trying to funnel some of the some of the

275
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,040
things that normally would go to a

276
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,480
security team if we don't have Champions

277
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,100
I want them to knock some of those

278
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,959
things off for us because I think that's

279
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,240
really the only way we scale

280
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,820
okay I don't know about you but every

281
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,600
time oh yeah question

282
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,959
here's where I've lost it and then they

283
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,480
become Champions

284
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,980
I think of those as really two separate

285
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,860
things so that those are more kind of

286
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,660
the General Security awareness things

287
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,980
that we have to do for the whole

288
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,300
population

289
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,640
for me security Champions are really

290
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,640
more focused on Engineering Building

291
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,100
developing now it doesn't mean that all

292
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,420
the things I'm describing here you can

293
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,339
use as a general awareness thing as well

294
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,200
I just come at this from more of an

295
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,360
engineering developing developer kind of

296
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,860
focus just because I've been living in

297
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,720
appsec for you know the last 10 years

298
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,180
but these principles you'll find you can

299
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,620
apply these to a lot of different online

300
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,320
community approaches

301
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,600
okay so I don't know about you but every

302
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,279
year I download the be some report for

303
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,240
one reason

304
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,620
because I want to know what this stat is

305
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,360
how much it's changed

306
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,640
and I literally don't read anything else

307
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,899
in it that's probably terrible to say

308
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:12,420
I'm on video but that's okay

309
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,760
but I do love this statistic but you

310
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,300
know this is a very misleading statistic

311
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,079
have any idea why this is misleading

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,120
because if you're a b Sim member and

313
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,160
you're willing to pay a big chunk of

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,660
money to be part of an organization

315
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,339
where you get assessed and checked

316
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,519
against all 150 other organizations you

317
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,920
already take security seriously

318
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,279
so my my kind of I guess my hypothesis

319
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,320
when I look at this number is this is

320
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,260
for bsim members what is it for the for

321
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,540
people that aren't part of bsim it can't

322
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,820
be the same and it can't be less is it

323
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,459
double is it four times more than this I

324
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,980
don't know but these people are the ones

325
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,360
that take security really seriously

326
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,160
enough to pay for it and that's the

327
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,200
that's the statistic that comes out of

328
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,540
it the 135 135 Developers for every one

329
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,820
security person but no matter what the

330
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,680
actual number is this Paints the picture

331
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,720
of why we have to have Champions because

332
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,980
you're not going to build a security

333
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,720
team big enough to keep up with your

334
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,880
development population I mean I've I've

335
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,339
not yet seen it anywhere where there is

336
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,720
a one to one or a two to one

337
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,300
relationship between uh between the the

338
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
security team and the developers that

339
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,399
exist

340
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,779
so I asked a couple of my friends that

341
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,000
run programs in different parts of uh

342
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,120
the technological industry space

343
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,700
and I got this interesting response

344
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,920
because I I want I asked one of my

345
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,320
friends that uh is that a is an abstract

346
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,700
director I'll say at a large company

347
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,440
that's as close as I can get

348
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
and I said uh you know can I can I talk

349
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,980
about what you're doing can I use you as

350
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,800
an example he's like no I was like oh

351
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,540
wow I thought the program was going

352
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,940
going well for you and this is what he

353
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,740
said

354
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,060
first of all that you know their

355
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,320
Champions program is not something he

356
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,480
wants to talk about but he this catch

357
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,399
this next part I've heard a common theme

358
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,899
that Champions programs aren't working

359
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,639
well in many companies this past year

360
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,440
the Champions aren't being allocated

361
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,500
enough time to really take on the role

362
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,920
resulting in Miss missed expectations

363
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,440
and this is really the root of if there

364
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,540
is a a problem with a Champions program

365
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,540
this is the one that gets you every time

366
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,579
is the people who are going to need

367
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,920
you're asking to be champions

368
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,360
are not

369
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,639
getting the support they need from their

370
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
management structure to do the champion

371
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,380
things you're asking them to do and so

372
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,880
this is one that we have to solve if

373
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,959
you're gonna have a successful Champions

374
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,279
program you have to solve this you

375
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,820
cannot you cannot have this be be kind

376
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,220
of over the heads of your Champions and

377
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,560
I'll give you a specific example

378
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
where I've seen this

379
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,399
cause a lot of pain

380
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,660
so in a past program I had some people I

381
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,700
had a stage in this program where I

382
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,899
didn't have

383
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,720
the necessary buy-ins from everybody and

384
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,399
so I had a couple of developers that

385
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,600
were Champions that were part of the

386
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,220
program that went rogue

387
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,500
and what I mean by went rogue is their

388
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,600
manager said no you don't I need you to

389
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,160
do these other things and they they told

390
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,899
their managers screw you I'm going to be

391
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,339
a champion because they said I can be a

392
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,620
champion in the program

393
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,260
HR was involved I got they I got called

394
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,820
into the middle of it it was not a

395
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,139
pretty thing it was not a pretty sight

396
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,279
and so I learned something from this

397
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,240
you're going to see in the framework

398
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,139
that's going to come out that's going to

399
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,880
solve that but but this is our biggest

400
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,980
challenge that we have to be ready to

401
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,300
understand how we're going to deal with

402
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,279
it all right don't fall out of your seat

403
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,519
on this one okay anybody because this is

404
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,620
a pie in the sky goal I have right now

405
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,720
not the first part product adjacent is

406
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,940
security Force multipliers I see that as

407
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,920
a real thing that we can do a real goal

408
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,040
we can go after getting my product

409
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,839
managers to be an advocate for security

410
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,579
my developers my sres my QA people my

411
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,339
program managers everybody seeing the

412
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,620
value proposition and seeing themselves

413
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,480
as being part of the solution I think

414
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
that's a that's an it's not an easy goal

415
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,320
but it's not insurmountable

416
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,959
I really want to see one

417
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,940
security Champion for every eight

418
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,399
developers inside of a company this is

419
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,420
the part where you can fall out of your

420
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,399
chair because I mean think about how big

421
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,779
your organization is think in your own

422
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,399
brain right now how many developers do I

423
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,579
have and if I had one Champion for every

424
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,320
eight of them how how big would my

425
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,579
program be

426
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,440
I helped you because I looked at a

427
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,000
couple of different examples

428
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,940
I went to uh the best

429
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,680
um

430
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
social engineering tool on the on the

431
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,660
internet today LinkedIn sales Navigator

432
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,880
because they have more they have more

433
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
data about companies than you you could

434
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
believe and so I

435
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,620
love who these people are it doesn't

436
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,120
matter who the who the actual companies

437
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,339
are but LinkedIn sales Navigator lets me

438
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,899
see the company and then the number of

439
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,360
employees and then the number uh you

440
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,860
know size of their engineering team and

441
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,260
then I can I can take a guess as far as

442
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,639
how big the software Engineers with some

443
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,920
other data there and so take a look at

444
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,199
at a just kind of how this breaks down

445
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,079
large online real retailer 70 000 people

446
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,440
we're guessing 40 000 software Engineers

447
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,760
guessing 300 people part of the security

448
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,940
Team 5 000 champions

449
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,560
so when you start to get to big size

450
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,480
companies that one to eight really turns

451
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,940
into a big number but it's not as scary

452
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,860
if you look at you know like a ride

453
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,120
sharing company

454
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,180
has about 4 800 in engineering 22 on

455
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,860
this on the security team and that and

456
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,800
one to eight ratio gets us to 375 from

457
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,420
our number of Champions

458
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,160
insurance company

459
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,079
um 52 Champions as a result of their

460
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,540
size of their team automaker 313. so

461
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,519
it's really only when you get to the big

462
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,279
really big size companies where the one

463
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,899
to eight starts to go oh it's getting

464
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,660
that's getting to be like a really

465
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,579
gigantic uh program that needs a number

466
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,019
of smaller programs in between

467
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,100
so here's a phased approach that I've

468
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,079
seen for security Champions programs and

469
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,240
I see a lot of a lot of programs go

470
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,839
through this same type of of progression

471
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,899
and so they start with this group of of

472
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,939
Die Hard passionate people that are at

473
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,459
the core that they start small it's like

474
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,260
a Grassroots effort maybe management

475
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,760
Executives don't even know that it's

476
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,459
happening when it initially kicks off

477
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,380
and then they go to this second phase

478
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,760
and the phase in the middle is the one I

479
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,480
hate

480
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,339
I wish we could just jump over this one

481
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,319
the middle phase is the security

482
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,679
voluntold face where

483
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,040
a decree comes out from somebody that

484
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,660
says we're going to have a two security

485
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,400
champions for every product in our

486
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,660
company

487
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,280
and then some of those teams this is

488
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,940
what happens okay let's see uh you and

489
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,799
you you're the Champions go

490
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
you're gonna you're gonna be great

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,400
but the challenge is that I don't know

492
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,720
if you and you are passionate about

493
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,340
security if you've got that little spark

494
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,419
because if you don't have that spark

495
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,039
you're gonna be like oh this sucks more

496
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,260
work I got to do you know I gotta stack

497
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,240
on top of my existing day job so I don't

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,280
love the voluntold phase but I've seen

499
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,080
it happen so many times it's it's a

500
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
natural progression as far as trying to

501
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,860
grow and scale a Champions program

502
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,740
especially at larger companies

503
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,419
now the third phase there the security

504
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,100
volunteers this is where I want to get

505
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,720
us to and this is where I got the Cisco

506
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,020
program to I went from knocking on Cube

507
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,360
walls like a I don't know I don't even

508
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,980
know how to describe it something that

509
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,299
people had never seen before in the

510
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,200
building

511
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,480
to a couple of short years later I had

512
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,520
people chasing me trying to get into the

513
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,179
program

514
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,340
people saying oh I want to be part of

515
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,780
that because you know what they started

516
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,160
to see the value proposition they

517
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,720
started to see the benefits that we were

518
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,820
providing to our Champions and they said

519
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,679
I want to be part of that and that was a

520
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,000
fun stage because then I could set

521
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
requirements and I could say oh you want

522
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
to be a champion huh well you got to

523
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,380
reach a certain level in our education

524
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,020
program then we can talk

525
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,059
I could set some other I could set some

526
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,820
some more deeper requirements on it

527
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,960
so

528
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,820
one of one of the biggest biggest

529
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,500
problems we have is people who are

530
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,900
running Champions programs is we always

531
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,299
think about the Champions program is for

532
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,340
us we're the security team what are we

533
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,080
getting out of this and I'm going to

534
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,520
challenge you today to say flip that

535
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,320
table upside down because this is not

536
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
about us this is about what are we going

537
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,200
to do for the people who are going to be

538
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,760
champions in our program

539
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,500
how are we going to provide them value

540
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,600
so they will chase you down and say I

541
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,120
want to be in this I see the value in

542
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,280
this thing so Advanced Training

543
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,500
knowledge and degrees exclusive learning

544
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,020
events specific acknowledgment and

545
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,360
recognition for them doing a good job

546
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,760
having exposure to management and

547
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,440
Executives as a result of good things

548
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,539
they're doing as a champion being able

549
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,280
to collaborate with different people

550
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,100
from across the business and and meet

551
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,299
different people different security

552
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,220
Champions you know and if you're in a

553
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,720
big company that level of networking

554
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,520
could end up getting you a promotion and

555
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,740
a new job and a different business unit

556
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,660
and also that kind of career advancement

557
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,419
or that pivot into security

558
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,520
but really it is about thinking about

559
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,200
what's in it for them not what's in it

560
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
for you is security that's the key here

561
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,919
but you're going to get something out of

562
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
it right us as as the security team

563
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
we're going to get resources without

564
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
headcount and we all are going to love

565
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,200
that because we know we're not going to

566
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,480
grow our team to be the size that we

567
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,160
really want it to be to serve every

568
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,500
piece of the business

569
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,120
employees are going to be happier that

570
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,320
are a part of this you're going to have

571
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,120
a group of security coaches embedded

572
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,559
across the business there's going to be

573
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,059
a return on investment you're going to

574
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,860
have industry visibility if you go to a

575
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,660
certain point people you can get out and

576
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,039
go to conferences and talk about your

577
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,960
Champions program and everybody's like

578
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
ooh that company really takes security

579
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,260
seriously look at look at what they're

580
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,580
doing with the Champions program they're

581
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,559
really focused on making every product

582
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,900
secure inside of their portfolio

583
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,760
that's a powerful thing to take away

584
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,980
okay so all of that is the preamble two

585
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,480
this is what I call the security

586
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,460
Champion framework

587
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,559
and so I've broken this down into five

588
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,660
different categories of planning

589
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,220
marketing people execution and

590
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,140
measurement and then under those I've

591
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,960
got some sub areas and what I'm doing

592
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,419
with this framework is I'm giving you a

593
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,940
number of categories and then a series

594
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,640
between zero and three where you can

595
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,799
look at this and say Here's where I am

596
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,020
now and here's where I'm trying to go

597
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,760
and I'll tell you this isn't perfect at

598
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,860
this point like I need a lot more people

599
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,539
in the industry and those that are

600
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,700
running programs to to

601
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,260
take a look at what I've come up with

602
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,520
and provide feedback and that's

603
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,539
something I'm going to do with this in

604
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,760
the next couple of months is try to try

605
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,140
to really flesh it out with a lot more

606
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,240
data but let's jump in this is this is

607
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
kind of from my perspective so the first

608
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
one strategy what do you want them to do

609
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,919
what are we trying to do with this

610
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,299
Champions program what are the what's

611
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,120
the big picture goal everybody wants a

612
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,799
vision everybody wants something to aim

613
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,659
towards right don't just have a

614
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,340
Champions program and and say oh we're

615
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,600
going to do monthly meetings that's our

616
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,360
goal no that's not a goal that's a task

617
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,860
that's something I'll list on your task

618
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,539
thing like what are we trying to do

619
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,159
we're trying to change the way we

620
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:48,960
approach security inside this company I

621
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,100
don't know what what is it but figure

622
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,780
out what it is and you're going to see

623
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,460
with each of these uh individual

624
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,799
framework categories level zero is going

625
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,600
to be you're not doing it so like in

626
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,220
this case you know you don't even have a

627
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,080
program so you're a zero from a strategy

628
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,539
perspective but you're a level one if

629
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,280
you're defining and publicizing your

630
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,780
program objective so people know what

631
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,159
are we trying to do what is our shared

632
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,480
what are we aiming at what are we

633
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,580
working towards because being able to

634
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,860
communicate that with everybody really

635
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,960
helps them to to understand what are we

636
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,520
all trying to do together

637
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,280
level two you've got yearly goals for

638
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,780
your community okay that's something

639
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,460
that I did that was very successful

640
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,159
every year I set a new set of goals and

641
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
I sent them out to everybody that was a

642
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,940
champion and they had to acknowledge the

643
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,740
fact that here this was our shared goals

644
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,780
for the next year

645
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,700
defining and prioritizing that program

646
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,400
vision and then providing an acceptance

647
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
and tracking tool for the goals level

648
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,580
two I want to be able to know when

649
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,580
people opted into that simple tool to

650
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,679
know to be able to say this person's a

651
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,059
champion and they agreed with what we're

652
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,039
doing

653
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,159
and then from a level three extend your

654
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,659
tooling to provide yearly strategy

655
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,640
opt-in per Champion the other thing I

656
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,140
want to do there is I want to make sure

657
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,720
we have management

658
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,799
also opting in

659
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,539
I talked about that story earlier where

660
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:04,740
I had to go to uncomfortable meetings

661
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,179
and HR was there which is always

662
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,440
uncomfortable when I charge in the

663
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,059
meeting

664
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,220
by having that opt-in for the champion

665
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,440
and then the manager has to acknowledge

666
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,299
it as well you will never get called

667
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,620
into one of those meetings where someone

668
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,260
says well you said that this employee

669
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,360
should do could do Champion stuff and

670
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,980
I'm their manager and I said they can't

671
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,140
hold on

672
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,260
uh on October 4th you opted in last year

673
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,840
to give your your Champion here or your

674
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,299
employee here the the permission from

675
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,980
you to be a champion

676
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,659
it stops the whole conversation they

677
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,760
they are bought in and you know that

678
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,220
those Champions that are virtually

679
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,200
supporting your mission are protected

680
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,059
against their manager coming after them

681
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:46,320
because they're trying to do really

682
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,640
what's the right thing at the end of the

683
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,320
day

684
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,000
and then you know executive sponsor

685
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,520
buy-in for program Vision at level three

686
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,380
some of this is kind of my perspective

687
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,659
like I'm a I don't know I'm always like

688
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,919
let's start at the bottom let's do

689
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,799
Grassroots and let's just let's rise up

690
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,059
whatever we're doing and tell the

691
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,919
executives think it's their idea and

692
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,320
then they come back and and uh then say

693
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,400
they have this great idea that we're

694
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,659
gonna have a Champions program oh it's

695
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,039
been running for a year but don't tell

696
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,020
don't tell anybody I had a good idea

697
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,460
um so I'm not I don't usually like have

698
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,539
an idea and say let's go to the

699
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,400
executives and if they agree then we can

700
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,140
no start I like to start at the bottom

701
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,880
that's why I put executive sponsor

702
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
buying so far down here's a couple of

703
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,080
examples of program objectives you know

704
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,760
from an individual perspective establish

705
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,559
a growth path for developers of

706
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
transform into security Engineers that

707
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,679
could be your objective right there that

708
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,000
could be what you want to do with your

709
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,960
program

710
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,700
you think more from an organizational

711
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,440
perspective we want to serve as a

712
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,820
leadership and Catalyst for secure

713
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,100
product development in our sdl because

714
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,480
the Champions are the ones that can

715
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,520
really help you blow that up

716
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,200
or we want to be an industry-leading

717
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,840
program to improve our corporate image

718
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,220
and it could be all of these things

719
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,919
together too the point is set a high

720
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,620
level goal that seems insurmountable

721
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,940
like there's no way we could ever do

722
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,620
this set something you know pick a

723
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,059
really big goal that people can get

724
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,340
behind and go after because people will

725
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,220
get behind you in this process

726
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,620
here's an example of a set of goals that

727
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,419
towards the end of my time on The Cisco

728
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,220
program that I use specific goals I used

729
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
that Champions opted into

730
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,419
participating in our champion sessions

731
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,520
and monthly meetings had to state that

732
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,539
because if somebody's not going to come

733
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,100
to my monthly meeting they're not going

734
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,720
to be a champion for long because that's

735
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,640
where that was our main place where we

736
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,080
were distilling information and we were

737
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,640
doing training and we were you know

738
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
getting people excited

739
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,720
driving adoption of sdl attain a

740
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,820
specific education level so we had an

741
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,460
education program at Cisco I raised the

742
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,020
bar every year for my Champions until

743
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,820
they were at the highest levels of the

744
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,559
security education program that we had

745
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,360
because I wanted them to be examples

746
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,400
inside of their business where other

747
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,260
people looked at them and said oh that's

748
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,760
a someone is a champion and they're a

749
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,100
black belt security whoa I want to be

750
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,000
like that

751
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,799
people will follow that they will see

752
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,840
that's someone I want to be

753
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,240
and then you know in different year one

754
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,100
year I focused on threat modeling as one

755
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,200
of the security Champion goals I had a

756
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
goal like teach perform five threat

757
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
models and teach two people how to do it

758
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,980
something like that but that I had you

759
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,419
know hundreds of Champions then that

760
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,159
took that goal to heart and we focused

761
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,600
on threat modeling a lot in that one

762
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,100
year and we made a lot of progress and

763
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,419
the next year we changed it we did

764
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,159
something else so those are just some

765
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,659
examples of goals

766
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,480
okay so from a scope perspective here

767
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,600
how deep is the program so level zero if

768
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,039
you're developers only

769
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,840
because I want those product adjacent

770
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,820
people that you'll see at level one my

771
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,760
scrum folks my sres devops cloud level

772
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,919
two is product managers

773
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,720
and level three is Executives and

774
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,720
managers I've never cracked level three

775
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,480
I could never get it I tried I tried and

776
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,940
when I think about so I don't so

777
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,320
sometimes this can be confusing because

778
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,520
you can look at this and say well wait

779
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,020
all these people are together in the

780
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,919
same program no I had a a product

781
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,380
manager security Champion Forum going at

782
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,200
Cisco so I could have tailored content

783
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,480
to those folks it was I did a regular

784
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,980
monthly meeting and they were invited to

785
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,720
the bigger monthly meeting but a lot of

786
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,860
the things we talked about in the

787
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,360
regular monthly meeting were more

788
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,460
Technical and they it wasn't maybe as as

789
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,380
applicable to them but I would have a

790
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,419
separate product manager meeting

791
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,159
talk about things that are that are that

792
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,380
they can take action upon

793
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,120
but I never got to the executives and

794
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,679
manager so if you ever do that please

795
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,659
find me wherever I am and send me an

796
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:22,860
email let me know

797
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,720
because I'd love to hear I'd love to see

798
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,460
somebody that has a program where they

799
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,919
have a a maybe it's a quarterly forum

800
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,779
for their Executives and managers and

801
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,880
directors and stuff where you're talking

802
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,620
at a much higher level but you're asking

803
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,179
them to help you you know take the

804
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,039
mission even further

805
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,960
okay how about branding how are you

806
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,580
going to represent this this group

807
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,980
you've built to the bigger company

808
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,840
level zero you're not doing any branding

809
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
level one you've created a name and a

810
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,120
tagline for your community

811
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,559
people want something they can get

812
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,840
behind from a you know they wanna they

813
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,720
want a some type of a you know a cool

814
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,100

815
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,299

oh that sounds kind of cool I'm part of

817
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,500
the security ninjas and so having that

818
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,179

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,919
visual look and a logo and mascot that

825
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,419
goes with it

826
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:23,039
we're all in sales and marketing here if

827
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,480

828
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,100

829
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,799
15 17 years ago I was traveling the

830
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,600
world for Cisco running internal

831
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,520
security conferences and one of my

832
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,080
friends at the time you're having dinner

833
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,000

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,620

835
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,600

840
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,400
around and we explain to people why

841
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,260
security is important for them and how

842
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,600
they should get behind it and we send

843
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,340

a mascot and stuff so we can print some

859

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,380
brand will grow and you'll get to the

870
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,179
point where this branding becomes

871
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:46,140
something that everyone in the

872
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,880
organization knows oh that's the

873
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,799
security ninjas those those people are

874
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,179
really moving security inside our

875
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:52,799
company

876
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,299
okay how about recruitment how are we

877
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,679
going to find and sign up our new

878
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,020
Champions along the way here

879
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,700
um I talked about this is kind of the

880
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,320
kind of models what I showed you on that

881
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,059
previous slide I think of level one is

882
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,380
finding that group of security

883
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,659
passionate People level two is when it's

884
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,399
a mandatory thing and level three is

885
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,919
when you've got real volunteer opt-in

886
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,779
where people are chasing you going I

887
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,940
want that t-shirt how do I get it

888
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,520
oh you got to become a security champion

889
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
okay how about commitment

890
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,179
how much time are your Champions

891
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,399
spending on security on average the

892
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,080
model that I talk about here these are

893
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,820
not dedicated resources I'm always

894
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,559
slicing taking slices of individual

895
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,720
existing resources in the model that I

896
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,980
work with here

897
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,200
and so if you're getting one hour a week

898
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
two to four hours a week or eight hours

899
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,980
a week level three eight hours a week

900
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,480
that's that's where always where I aimed

901
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
for that's what what I I would have as

902
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,140
part of my goals for the The Cisco

903
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,820
security Advocates was I want eight

904
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,679
hours a week from these these

905
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,960
individuals

906
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,220
so that's that's kind of how the

907
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,740
commitment portion works out here

908
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,480
how about communication you know so how

909
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,580
are you going to keep everybody else

910
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,840
connected to what you're doing from a

911
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,520
mission perspective

912
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,620
level one is just communication with

913
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,120
your Champions level two with the

914
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,919
Champions direct managers and level

915
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,740
three getting to Executives with a and

916
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,240
what I mean by that is a tailored

917
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,500
message I don't mean you're just adding

918
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,000
the executives to the same messaging

919
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,380
that's going out to everybody else

920
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,659
Executives speak a different language we

921
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,299
know this they they understand return on

922
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,539
investment and risk and and costs and

923
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,460
budgets and so we have to give them a

924
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,899
different message that shows the value

925
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:30,059
that the Champions are bringing rolled

926
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,320
up to something that they can just look

927
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,480
at and go yep I see the value we're

928
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,039
getting out of this the return on

929
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,260
investment here

930
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,720
so updating direct managers that goes

931
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,600
back to the story I told I also would

932
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,360
whenever a champion did something even

933
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,220
marginally good I would send their

934
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,659
manager an email

935
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,279
and say oh I just want to let you know

936
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,659
this person just did this thing was

937
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,220
really cool I'm just just want to tell

938
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,020
you I'm excited about it and that would

939
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,000
be the end of the email right there but

940
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,799
when it got to review time for that

941
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,500
person they would have a a slew of

942
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,000
emails from me that was highlighting

943
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,919
cool things I had seen them do and they

944
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,059
could bring that to the review process

945
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,799
and say well I'm doing some cool things

946
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,299
here

947
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,520
high-level reports newsletters you know

948
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,320
creating slack and teams channels is a

949
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,820
good way to build that especially since

950
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,159
we're still primarily in a virtualized

951
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,200
kind of world here we got to find ways

952
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,940
for for Champions to bounce things off

953
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,760
each other on a day-to-day basis

954
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,020
okay so let's talk about the program

955
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,640
what are we going to offer these folks

956
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,279
that provides value to them

957
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,440
everybody monthly training is is the big

958
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
one like everybody's everybody starts

959
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,279
there and you know what monthly training

960
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,380
is at monthly kind of uh meeting

961
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,059
sessions they're easy for the first

962
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,919
three months you know what sucks that

963
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,779
fourth month because you're like who the

964
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,580
heck am I going to have talk now I've

965
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,080
pretty much gotten everybody that I

966
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,760
could find and so some of the things

967
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,720
that I've done to to fill speakers in

968
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,940
those type of slots one I built

969
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,799
different ways to collect what

970
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,720
interesting things Champions were doing

971
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,279
and I would just reflect that back and

972
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,220
say hey Jane next monthly meeting for

973
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,320
November you're gonna you need to give

974
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
me one to three slides on this thing

975
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,140
that you did that was so cool because

976
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,120
everybody needs to know this so we had a

977
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,399
15-minute segment of people just quickly

978
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,559
sharing cool things and and encouraging

979
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,659
the rest of the teams

980
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,179
the other thing I'll tell you is I used

981
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,399
to reach out to people from lots of

982
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,080
different organizations lots of people

983
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,700
that I would see speak at conferences

984
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,500
and say hey will you come and talk to my

985
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,019
champions for 30 minutes using something

986
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,700
you've already prepared

987
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,260
meaning you don't have to do any work

988
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,960
other than 30 minutes showing up and I

989
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,820
had great success and and you can say oh

990
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,320
well you were Cisco and you know maybe

991
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,580
you're maybe you're thinking I'm not

992
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,279
Cisco what I can tell you though is like

993
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,899
I'm somebody who speaks in the industry

994
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,880
quite a bit if you reach out to me and

995
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,440
say hey will you come in and talk to my

996
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,940
champions for 30 minutes with something

997
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,799
you've already prepared virtually

998
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,539
meaning I don't want you to fly to my

999
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,179
location I'll do it as long as I can

1000
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,559
make it align with my schedule I'll do

1001
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,399
it

1002
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,140
because you're not really asking me to

1003
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,700
do that much now if you're like hey can

1004
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,679
you create something original and speak

1005
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,860
for two hours to my Champions

1006
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,880
now you're talking about I got to spend

1007
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,919
about 10 hours of my time to 20 hours

1008
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,780
and but for something I've already done

1009
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,820
and for you know folks that that speak

1010
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,918
at conferences all the time we've got a

1011
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,659
number of talks we've already done like

1012
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,000
I can literally just jump on and do a

1013
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
good talk with something I've

1014
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,300
pre-prepared that'll get your audience

1015
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,099
excited about it so don't be afraid to

1016
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,480
reach out to people and ask in this

1017
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
industry we we we're too often scared to

1018
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,619
reach out to people because like oh I

1019
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,300
can't even talk to that reach out this

1020
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,399
is everybody's just people here like it

1021
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,359
seems like there's some type of

1022
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,980
hierarchy there's really not

1023
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,839
like anybody that speaks at conferences

1024
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,280
like you put them in the middle of a

1025
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,899
football stadium and guess what nobody

1026
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,460
knows who they are they're like I don't

1027
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,780
know why is that crazy man in the middle

1028
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,119
of the stadium down there

1029
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,879
so level two special training webinars

1030
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,099
internal ctfs security days having

1031
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,500
special events for for my Champions gets

1032
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,719
me to a higher level and then level

1033
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,839
three internal conferences is is a big

1034
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,920
thing and then I'll tell you about

1035
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,240
another thing the two things I did with

1036
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,020
the Cisco program I uh I did a csslp so

1037
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,119
ISC squared has a kind of an abstract

1038
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,619
Focus certification I took like my 24

1039
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:13,380
top performing Champions and I got my

1040
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,880
management team to approve we just

1041
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,060
bought a csslp virtual class six weeks

1042
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,220
long with an instructor those 24

1043
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,500
Champions were invited and I paid for

1044
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,200
the them to take the csslp test out of

1045
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,160
my budget

1046
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,940
guess what cost me what uh forty

1047
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,079
thousand dollars maybe at the end of the

1048
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,820
day do you know how much how much how

1049
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,300
much those those Champions were excited

1050
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,980
ready to take on the whole world inside

1051
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,020
the company like they were motivated

1052
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,000
and it cost me forty thousand dollars

1053
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,260
which you know that's a lot of money

1054
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,940
don't get me wrong but in the scheme of

1055
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,800
Cisco's world that was a tiny little

1056
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
drill like you wouldn't even find it on

1057
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
the floor it'd be so small in here

1058
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,579
but it it those people really felt

1059
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,320
appreciated in that moment

1060
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,560
other things that we did there um I went

1061
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,420
and worked with San Jose State and we

1062
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,640
created a master's program for our

1063
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,079
champions

1064
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,339
and

1065
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,859
went through and tailored the whole

1066
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,800
whole setup for them that story is kind

1067
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,839
of another kind of funny experience so

1068
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,540
really quickly I go to uh this meeting

1069
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,880
with the folks from San Jose State

1070
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,540
I'm prepared to be pitched on the idea

1071
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,880
I get there there's all these like

1072
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,320
professors that have so many letters

1073
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,880
after their name I don't even know you

1074
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,980
know I'm very intimidated and they walk

1075
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,420
over with the pen and they hand me the

1076
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,700
marker and they say hey why don't you

1077
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,200
sketch out on the board what you think

1078
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,780
would be the best way to solve to serve

1079
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,200
your people and I'm like uh oh but

1080
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,579
luckily the night before I had literally

1081
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,560
scribbled on a napkin in my hotel room

1082
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,700
kind of like what I thought it would be

1083
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,320
but I was expecting these you know

1084
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,599
Monster academic people to just you know

1085
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,160
have this whole map figured out and

1086
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,240
they're like hey what do you think we

1087
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,240
should do okay but two and a half years

1088
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,619
after we launched it our first people

1089
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,900
graduated from it and I'm excited to say

1090
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,460
a number of them went on and took other

1091
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,140
jobs and have moved into security now

1092
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,880
they were developer they went through

1093
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,440
that master's degree program they went

1094
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,300
and jumped some to other companies I

1095
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,760
don't I mean it was it's still a

1096
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,020
powerful thing even if they didn't work

1097
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,240
at the same company anymore we that

1098
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
program helped them to grow and change

1099
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,480
their lives and go down a whole

1100
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,040
different career path that's really what

1101
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,780
this is about right it's not about me

1102
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,400
it's about how can I help these people

1103
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,520
get somewhere further down the road

1104
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,640
okay coaching this is a relatively new

1105
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,460
one for me I was talking on the appsec

1106
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,619
podcast to a guy who works in a large

1107
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:34,800
Financial in Pennsylvania and he's the

1108
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,079
one who uh who really taught me this

1109
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,760
whole concept of coaching what he had

1110
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,000
done is he brought in effectively life

1111
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,460
coaches for security on his team he had

1112
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,079
a few of them and what they would do is

1113
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,220
they would jump in and work with

1114
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,200
developers at just for a short period of

1115
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,579
time and then they would they would kind

1116
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,619
of move on to the next person maybe they

1117
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:53,880
were helping them learn how to threat

1118
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,680
model they were working through a design

1119
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,079
problem they were trying to show them

1120
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,000
some secure coding tips or whatnot but

1121
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
they had taken he had taken this

1122
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,820
coaching idea and I thought you know

1123
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,020
what this is this is going to become

1124
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,579
part of what I recommend going for

1125
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:07,380
because it's a really powerful

1126
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,359
connection point to people

1127
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,859
and so with level one you've got

1128
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,780
volunteer coaches within your Champions

1129
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,940
two you've got staffed coaches you've

1130
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,140
got people on your team that are

1131
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,579
prepared to be those security life

1132
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,000
coaches and three you've got coaches

1133
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,440
that are dedicated to different parts of

1134
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,940
the business that are really out there

1135
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,800
and their goal is to really work mostly

1136
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,180
with the Champions but also other

1137
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,700
developers along the way

1138
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,040
education I think Champions and

1139
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,400
education programs have to be interwoven

1140
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,599
there has to be a connection here

1141
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,240
because one the education program is a

1142
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,000
feeder for my Champions if I have

1143
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,980
someone start with the company and six

1144
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,420
months later they've gone through four

1145
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,460
levels of my security training and I

1146
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,200
don't know who they are guess what I'm

1147
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,339
gonna send them an email and say you

1148
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,839
need to be a security champion because

1149
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,540
you just spent uh probably 50 hours of

1150
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,339
your own time learning about security

1151
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,500
inside of our training platform so I

1152
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,940
want I'd like to see these two things

1153
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,440
interwoven

1154
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
so level one

1155
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,980
um your ad hoc security training level

1156
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,599
two you've got regular security training

1157
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,859
for all your Champions level three

1158
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:10,020
you've got hackathons build it break it

1159
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,480
fix it contests all kinds of things that

1160
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,700
are from that educational perspective

1161
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,160
and thanks to the devsecops maturity

1162
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,140
model of the OAS project I was

1163
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,180
struggling with how to to put together

1164
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,880
this list for this particular item and I

1165
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,400
looked in dsum and this is what uh Teemo

1166
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,800
had put into the dsom to cover this to

1167
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,119
cover the education side and I liked

1168
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,640
what he did so I borrowed it

1169
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,079
okay retention how are we going to keep

1170
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,700
them coming back for more

1171
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,339
so one simple retention being let's just

1172
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,660
send some messages to them let's

1173
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,640
encourage them throughout their time as

1174
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,220
as Champions level two you need to tap

1175
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,680
into your existing rewards system so

1176
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,780
inside your companies you have some HR

1177
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,359
focused Rewards program nobody ever uses

1178
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,820
it for the most part become the biggest

1179
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,740
consumer of that program

1180
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,619
so at Cisco the HR team would put aside

1181
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,520
10 percent of a team's salary into a

1182
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,640
fund for cap Awards like for for on the

1183
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,079
spot type of awards and stuff like that

1184
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,780
and guess what nobody ever used them so

1185
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,099
the money would sit there and at the end

1186
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,240
of the quarter it would get peeled off

1187
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,740
and put back into the general fund or

1188
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,740
whatever I found a way to tap into it so

1189
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,540
I would I would tell the manager hey

1190
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,300
send this person a reward please you

1191
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,440
know what's coming out of the Cap Fund

1192
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,700
so it's not costing you any money you've

1193
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,780
already got the money you're not using

1194
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,160
it kind of guilt them a little bit into

1195
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,579
it and I became the biggest driver of

1196
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,140
money going out of that fund I literally

1197
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,000
gave away Millions even though I never

1198
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
did one it was just encouraging people

1199
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,839
but that was an existing Rewards program

1200
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,700
that existed you know you could you

1201
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,900
could

1202
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,579
um I wasn't create I didn't have to go

1203
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,140
ask for Budget or something and the

1204
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,280
budget was there people just weren't

1205
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,359
using

1206
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:50,040
and then three

1207
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,200
if you get to that level three get your

1208
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,599
own budget for rewarding people that's a

1209
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,060
powerful thing imagine being able to say

1210
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,220
these folks here are the 10 Champions

1211
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,780
that have just been kicking butt this

1212
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,480
year I'm sending y'all to black hat

1213
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,820
on my out of my budget I'm paying for

1214
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,960
your travel I'm paying for your

1215
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,040
conference I'm sending you to a

1216
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,420
three-day training there

1217
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,800
you want to talk about some excited

1218
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,540
people that'll go to go to battle for

1219
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,339
you in the future plus you're still

1220
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,020
meeting that goal of leveling up and

1221
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,260
helping them helping them grow

1222
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,640
a lot of things you can do for a

1223
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,859
retention perspective you know we talked

1224
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,020
about a few of these you know um but

1225
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,400
public recognition is a big thing

1226
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,380
recognizing people at in their

1227
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,720
management structures

1228
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,359
um t-shirts stickers team slack messages

1229
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,099
certificates whatever you got to do

1230
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,300
there's a lot of things there's a lot of

1231
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,800
ideas you can use from a retention

1232
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,119
perspective

1233
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,160
so just two more items in the framework

1234
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,960
here metrics and measurement how do we

1235
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,000
demonstrate program Roi

1236
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,859
so for me level one is about just doing

1237
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:49,200
basic metrics how many champions do we

1238
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,700
have what's our distribution across

1239
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,980
business units and product what's the

1240
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,540
levels of Education in the education

1241
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,640
program that these folks have done and

1242
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,160
then what's the flaw density how can I

1243
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,599
compare these Champions against other

1244
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,160
developers or other people in different

1245
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,500
functions to see how they're doing are

1246
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,000
they doing better or worse than other

1247
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
people you know in the same job role

1248
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,859
from an intermediate perspective I want

1249
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,260
to see this thing called an enps not

1250
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,119
about you I just learned about this at

1251
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,520
the open security Summit um about a

1252
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,079
month or two ago and I'd never heard of

1253
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,940
an idea of an employee net promoter

1254
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,859
score but you this is something you can

1255
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,359
send it's I didn't come up with it if

1256
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,859
someone else was explaining it to me and

1257
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,660
I was like wow that would be a cool

1258
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,200
thing to send my Champions to see our do

1259
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,000
my Champions feel like they want to

1260
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,339
invite other people to be champions and

1261
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,900
and that's an interesting metric to

1262
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,940
watch because if they uh you know are

1263
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,060
scoring a 9.6 or something out of 10 I

1264
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,740
know I'm feeding them with the right

1265
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,020
stuff rewards recognition opportunities

1266
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,780
if it's below six I probably got some

1267
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,980
work to do

1268
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,839
and then the third metric there third

1269
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,440
level action based are you taking action

1270
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,000
based on the metrics and measurements

1271
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
that you have are you changing the the

1272
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,359
things that you do do you have that

1273
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,540
ability to do that

1274
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,160
okay last one globalization how do you

1275
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
build a program if you're a worldwide

1276
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
company

1277
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,740
at Cisco I had gigantic offices in

1278
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,260
Bangalore I had Shanghai

1279
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,960
um I had Amsterdam and then I had east

1280
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,140
and west coast U.S and then a few other

1281
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,420
places sprinkled around the world

1282
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,339
so from a globalization perspective

1283
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:25,200
level one schedule in a comfortable way

1284
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,819
for Global Citizens what I mean by that

1285
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,660
is don't schedule the meeting at 8 A.M

1286
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,240
or you know 7 A.M Eastern Time

1287
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,099
even 8 A.M eastern time because it's

1288
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,020
five o'clock in California and it might

1289
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,140
be you know uh try to find the opportune

1290
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,760
time for your entire audience is what

1291
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,960
I'm saying here there's a

1292
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,540
timeanddate.com meeting planner it's a

1293
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,460
website I use it all the time when I'm

1294
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,960
trying to connect people and find the

1295
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,760
right time for a meeting

1296
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,099
uh for level two have a local time and

1297
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,660
event schedule an event for those local

1298
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,140
for the folks I used to do an India time

1299
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,700
um a time I used to do a separate

1300
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,200
Champions meeting towards the end of my

1301
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,260
time for my folks in Bangalore and China

1302
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,540
and whatnot it would be it would start

1303
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,579
at midnight East Coast time

1304
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,400
but I'd have 150 people on the line so

1305
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,920
yes was it was it uh you know not as

1306
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,040
easy for me of course but was I you know

1307
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,140
have was I making 150 people have to

1308
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,579
deal with a crappy time where they live

1309
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,520
like in early evening family time no so

1310
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,200
I just sucked it up it was once a month

1311
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,780
12 till 1 30 in the morning I slept in

1312
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,520
the next day but those people

1313
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,319
appreciated the fact that that they were

1314
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:33,300
not having to like they always had to do

1315
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,220
for everything else which was meet in

1316
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,040
the times that were not ideal for them

1317
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,780
ideal for the people in the U.S

1318
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,000
and then level three put boots on the

1319
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,500
ground you got to have some people there

1320
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,700
if you're gonna be level three you got

1321
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,619
to put people in your Global sites that

1322
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,300
are from your security team that are

1323
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,560
leading those Champions and you're

1324
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,660
almost creating sub teams of Champions

1325
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,579
that are doing their own thing locally

1326
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,800
on their time zones and and being

1327
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,480
encouraged there

1328
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,819
so if you run all these scores up

1329
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:02,160
there's three levels on each of these 36

1330
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,859
possible points 12 areas these are just

1331
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,780
my ideas zero four to fourteen you've

1332
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,819
got room to grow 15 to 23 you're making

1333
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,920
some progress and 24 plus you're on that

1334
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,660
way to that world-class type of a

1335
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,740
program

1336
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,420
I'll make the slides available you can

1337
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,220
dig into this as much as you want from a

1338
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,319
program assessment perspective but I

1339
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:21,420
just I just made up some numbers based

1340
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,280
on programs I've seen just so you could

1341
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,599
see kind of how the numbers would roll

1342
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,020
out you know it's a one that's striving

1343
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,180
um was at about the 20 and a half an

1344
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,980
excellent one was 33 and something that

1345
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,540
I know that was failing was I would

1346
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,040
count them as a four according to this

1347
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,000
module

1348
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,560
but you can dig into that more with the

1349
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,540
slides so here we are wrapping it up

1350
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,700
applying this you know if you've got a

1351
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,619
security Community Champions and whatnot

1352
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:45,480
I would recommend assessing where you

1353
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,460
are against the framework try to see try

1354
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,619
to see how what you're doing fits in

1355
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,780
first three months pick a couple of

1356
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,359
these actions and try to raise the raise

1357
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,560
your level

1358
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,300
that's why I wrote it the way I did here

1359
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,400
it's like you can create a you can do a

1360
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,079
just in time here's where we are an

1361
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:02,520
assessment you can also do a future

1362
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,260
looking roadmap to say here's some

1363
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,460
things we want to do to improve our

1364
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,380
program

1365
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,819
okay there's a picture of the framework

1366
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,900
again

1367
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,140
and my key takeaways so think about what

1368
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,280
you're providing for those Champions

1369
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,900
what's in it for them I've said it about

1370
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,819
10 times I'll say it 10 more times if I

1371
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:19,200
have to because that's one of the most

1372
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,240
important things make it about them

1373
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,099
find the areas in the framework there

1374
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:25,079
that that you need to improve as you

1375
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,060
build out the program do that plan of

1376
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,560
action and just know that your company

1377
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,900
needs Champions it's it's really going

1378
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,339
to provide a huge amount of value I've

1379
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,560
seen this be revolutionary in so many

1380
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,940
different places

1381
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,520
and with that I've saved they said they

1382
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,720
had the room the rest of the day so I've

1383
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,579
got two hours for questions

1384
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,319
available here so that's my contact

1385
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,060
information as well I'm always happy to

1386
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,680
talk Champions threat modeling almost

1387
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,420
anything in the world of appsack but

1388
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,480
what do we got as far as uh questions

1389
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,920
I'll even say I'm going to say something

1390
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,720
dangerous here questions comments

1391
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,140
yeah please

1392
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,020
yeah

1393
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,520
yeah and I think that's great I mean the

1394
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,800
question was that she's seen some uh

1395
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,540
some Champions who really don't want to

1396
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,920
progress to be an engineer they just

1397
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,240
like being a champion that's awesome

1398
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,680
like I don't have any problem with that

1399
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,540
I want them to have the opportunity to

1400
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,640
progress but I need a good Core group of

1401
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,839
people that are going to be solid

1402
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,520
Champions throughout the lifetime of the

1403
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,200
program so I don't see that as a

1404
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,819
negative at all at all I want them to

1405
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,619
feel like they always have a role and

1406
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,420
they're continuing to grow even though

1407
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,040
they want us continue in what they're

1408
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,300
doing from a development perspective

1409
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,400
so you want an easy way

1410
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,700
oh what's the top 10. number one we talk

1411
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,859
about that the first first month number

1412
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,599
two you know we go so you got ten week

1413
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,060
10 months of meetings right there alone

1414
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,920
there's other things in oauth there's

1415
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,260
the proactive controls that's 10 10

1416
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,180
things so you've got some a lot of

1417
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,040
content in the world of OAS you can use

1418
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,800
what I used to do is I would aim to have

1419
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,720
an external speaker for 20 to 30 minutes

1420
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,760
so somebody that I had seen at a

1421
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,619
conference somewhere and just often I'd

1422
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,819
walk up to him after and say hey would

1423
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,560
you come in and do a talk to my

1424
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,079
Champions uh so I would aim to have a

1425
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:20,940
segment with an external speaker if I

1426
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,200
didn't have that I'd have an internal

1427
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,180
person sometimes fill that in as well so

1428
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,460
but there's a lot of OAS pieces you can

1429
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,420
use to to have a a bundle of focused

1430
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,980
content for a period of time

1431
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,819
there's no open source label on it yet I

1432
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:45,960
just made that decision it's going to be

1433
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,520
open source I might I'm thinking about

1434
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,079
making a no loss project and trying to

1435
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:50,819
figure out if that could be a vehicle to

1436
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,160
uh just store it so ever so it'd be

1437
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,359
bigger than me other people could

1438
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,000
contribute to it as well

1439
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,920
too cool

1440
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,300
all right well thanks everybody have a

1441
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,160
good uh rest of the time at lastcon

1442
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,140
[Applause]
