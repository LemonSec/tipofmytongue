6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,579
thanks for coming in I'm not sure how

7
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,719
many of you guys are hanging out in that

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,719
room but uh it's good to see you or good

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,719
to virtually be there I do have twins uh

10
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,060
their birthday was yesterday so in

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,040
between business trips to get home to

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,979
have their birthdays and then get back

13
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,080
out for another trip and then get to

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,420
Austin it made it impossible so I

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,680
apologize

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,080
um I wish I was there love Austin we'll

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,479
do this again next year all right cool

18
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,280
so this talk is called irrational but

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
effective applying paragraphs Parenthood

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,119
lessons with cyber security I am

21
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,740
somewhat of an expert on the Parenthood

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,060
although

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,979
um they're only nine but they haven't

24
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,780
killed me yet so that's good they've

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,700
also not figured out a way to blow up

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,939
themselves which is also good I've been

27
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,500
in information security for a while a

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,880
quick who am I for those of you that

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,100
have absolutely no idea who I am that's

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,259
okay I'm the head of services strategy

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,460
and go to market a company called extra

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,500
hop these days

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
um on the strategy advisor uh father of

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,020
twins more importantly been quote in the

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,000
business about a quarter of a century

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
although that sounds ridiculous to say

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,899
out loud uh some of you guys may know me

38
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,119
by the podcast down the security Rabbit

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,700
Hole I encourage you to check that out

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,560
um the rest can read on LinkedIn you

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,639
know it doesn't really it doesn't matter

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,860
much beyond that I'll say don't be

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,800
fooled uh these two uh are adorable but

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,239
it's some days like the hostage

45
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,819
negotiation with rabid terrorists uh and

46
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,260
so there's a lot of uh a lot of good

47
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,700
lessons in this all right and there's

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,040
about 10 of them the first one for me is

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,500
when things are quiet that is when you

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,480
should be really worried

51
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
um and so to me silence is terrifying

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,959
well my kids are loud I absolutely have

53
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,180
no idea what they're doing but it's okay

54
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,340
I'm not totally worried because I can

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,959
hear them and they're as long as I can

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,760
hear both their voices they're both

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,319
still uh you know they're both still

58
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,120
within earshot uh they're probably not

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
doing anything terrible and I can get

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,019
there when they are quiet that's when I

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,480
start to panic now as they get older uh

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,099
they play independently and then they

63
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,300
don't and sometimes they just you know

64
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,819
face in iPad for an hour also they'll be

65
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,980
super quiet but when they were small

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,080
when kids are small and they've become

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,319
quiet you should absolutely Panic so uh

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,640
this relates to the real world there's

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,140
like three types of baddies as far as

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,459
I'm concerned right those that set off

71
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,800
alarms those that leave a trail and then

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
those that are basically ghosts uh and

73
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,659
the ghosts that you um

74
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,280
the ghost that you should be concerned

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
about when you make this you can make

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,879
this full screen is that better

77
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,739
excellent so the go the ghosts are the

78
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:23,879
ones you should really be worried about

79
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,980
because the ghosts leave nothing and

80
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,900
that is you know whether it's logs or

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,640
any kind of evidence they tend to be

82
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,800
very very quiet they leave nothing but

83
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,360
they can be exceptionally devastating

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
those are the ones again like those are

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,540
the state sponsored actors are really

86
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,940
bad ones and so the takeaway from this

87
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
you know be worried when it's quiet

88
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,620
don't get complacent ever I've had uh

89
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
you know relating this back directly in

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,220
the appsec in my years way back way back

91
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,200
in the day I would hear things like well

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,340
there's nothing that says we're being

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,440
hacked so we must be good

94
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,780
um and and you know that that that's

95
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,640
nonsense in every possible way I can I

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,260
can describe it so

97
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,360
and don't get complacent like always be

98
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,519
on the on the assertion and assumption

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,720
that something that is happening

100
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,459
somewhere you're probably just not

101
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,019
seeing it if you're not seeing it that's

102
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:07,860
bad

103
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,180
all right the lesson two is you can't

104
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,799
prevent every possible oops bad things

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,360
will happen and you have to learn to

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,040
contain a disaster I had a diaper

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,019
reference in here but if you're a parent

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,820
I'll I'll just leave you with that that

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,339
image in your head and we'll move on

110
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,199
so you can teach kids right you can do

111
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,880
your best you can teach them you can

112
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,580
warn them uh and but bad stuff will

113
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,400
still happen I have a a colleague and a

114
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
close friend that uh

115
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,240
uh was very concerned when his teenage

116
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,220
daughter started driving

117
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,360
um you know he's like all right I'm

118
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,979
gonna I'm gonna you know buy the safest

119
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,199
car I'm gonna teach her how to drive

120
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,000
defensively I'm gonna you know make sure

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
that she's only driving during like

122
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,419
certain hours when it's daylight and all

123
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,699
that and never accounted for the fact

124
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,199
that uh a guy on a bicycle uh would

125
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,940
absolutely be looking the wrong way and

126
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,979
slammed right into her car like got into

127
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,720
an accident and it was absolutely

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,840
nothing of her fault right so sorry but

129
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,979
this is true

130
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,419
um you know there are plenty of people

131
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,680
out there that will tell you if you just

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,300
simply coddle your kids enough and wrap

133
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,460
them in duct tape and bubble wrap and

134
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,900
never let them out of the house nothing

135
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,880
bad will befall them these people do not

136
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,500
understand risk management

137
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,800
uh and so now the reality is crap is

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,000
going to happen you have to be able to

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,620
prepare them and design contingency

140
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,919
plans that you practice regularly okay

141
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,020
when I was a kid this may be dating me

142
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,400
but we learned things like stranger

143
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,860
danger uh we had the gruff the crime dog

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,860
right um unfortunately kids these days

145
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,600
um they don't get to do stranger danger

146
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
because their parents are literally over

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,020
their shoulder every day all day with a

148
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,000
camera uh staring at them when they're

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,120
not so involve everyone in this and what

150
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,460
I mean by that is building containment

151
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,800
into the practice into the platform into

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
the application into the environment

153
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,060
involves literally everybody so it's you

154
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,860
the household it's you your neighbors

155
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,780
it's you know getting them familiar with

156
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,639
the police department and getting them

157
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,020
familiar with the crossing guard their

158
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,820
teachers like what good looks like and

159
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,259
what bad looks like frankly because we

160
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,940
can tell like hey if somebody pulls up

161
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,020
to the you know while you're walking

162
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,759
home somebody pulls up opens a van so

163
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,680
say kid get in the car I got candy

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,440
yeah no that's probably not a good thing

165
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,360
um and if somebody emails you and says

166
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,100
hey if you click on this button you win

167
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,800
a free 50 gift certificate yes 98 of

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,020
your users will click on it but also not

169
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,759
again not a good thing

170
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,740
so the takeaways don't fail to prepare

171
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,840
just because you think you've done a lot

172
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
of uh stuff ahead of time and you've

173
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,360
done uh the quote the work don't fail to

174
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,000
prepare because you know you know what

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
they say about failing to prepare right

176
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,680
it's preparing to fail and that's the

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
thing with with like I learned about

178
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,500
with kids

179
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,419
um there you can teach them as much as

180
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,400
you can but eventually something is

181
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,539
going to happen that's beyond their

182
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,360
control uh in the in the app world I

183
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,160
can't tell you how many times apps would

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,100
go out uh that would be tested and

185
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,160
they'd be well uh secured and we'd be

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
like all right we're gonna allow only

187
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,060
like one port into this thing so we're

188
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,580
relatively safe and somebody fat fingers

189
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,160
a firewall rule not saying it was me

190
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,080
um but all of a sudden the thing is wide

191
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,580
open and we have a database open to the

192
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,800
world and bad things happened

193
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,100
okay the next one is creativity beats

194
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,259
boundaries every time and I think we

195
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,759
need to think about human creativity

196
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,860
more than we do especially in our

197
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,960
profession and if you're a parent I

198
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,940
think this this one one there's a lot

199
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,220
there's ten in here but this one really

200
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,680
always gets me because as a parent you

201
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,440
try to figure out in your rational adult

202
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,500
brain how to prevent kids from doing

203
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,479
let's just say things you don't want the

204
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,960
doing we never really think about the

205
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,000
fact that their brain works entirely

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,979
different than yours and mine does let

207
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,020
me explain so kids and hackers are

208
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,699
actually very similar in that they just

209
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,340
demonstrate amazing capability for

210
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,919
creativity there's an a phrase that I've

211
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,539
often used both at home and at the

212
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,979
office when doing this is how the hell

213
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:58,620
do they manage to do that okay if you've

214
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,599
ever if you've ever been in this

215
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,759
position you know exactly what I'm

216
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,699
talking about both work around control

217
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,860
so it's like the best laid plans right

218
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,259
you make you create controls you use

219
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,960
your rational old brain to go okay

220
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,800
attacker's going to try this and this

221
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,180
and this but I'm going to stop them by

222
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,580
doing this

223
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,400
and to that I say haha

224
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,099
I'll give you an example my kids are

225
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,599
like you know when they were a couple

226
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,139
years younger they were very short and

227
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,699
so if you want them out of the cookie

228
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,139
jar even though they say no Daddy I

229
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,880
won't take a cookie before breakfast we

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,380
all know that's a lie

231
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,299
so I put the cookies on the top shelf in

232
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,520
the pantry I don't have a picture but I

233
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
wish I did anybody know what happens

234
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,399
next

235
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,919
let me help you my daughter used my son

236
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,760
as a stepladder

237
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,720
and and

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,519
you know as you saw in the previous in

239
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,620
that picture of them uh she is built

240
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,480
like a ballerina he is built like a

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,060
linebacker so she simply said uh

242
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,160
apparently uh that she need to get she

243
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,899
can get up and get them both cookies if

244
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,360
she just used him as a ladder he hoisted

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
her up I come downstairs and they both

246
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,959
have this like look on their face I

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:07,980
don't know if I can if I'm still on

248
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,839
camera but they have that like

249
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,459
you know the raccoons and headlights

250
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,220
thing like what uh and you know there's

251
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,019
my daughter two shelves up and my son

252
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,760
holding her and they're sort of looking

253
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,140
at me like uh oh

254
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,959
and and my adult brain went what the

255
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,279
hell how

256
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
and but you know it this is this is how

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
it works in the real world so the

258
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,040
takeaway is

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
at that age and in that mindset right

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
both the attackers that you're dealt

261
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,060
deal with and the kids in your life they

262
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,980
do not think like you they will be

263
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,500
creative they will have things in their

264
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,680
brain that you cannot imagine or you're

265
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,480
just not able to anymore because you

266
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,300
know you're old like me and you just

267
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,920
recognize that you have to start

268
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
thinking that way you can't say well the

269
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,660
rules say no no that's useless don't use

270
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,800
that phrase

271
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,839
so that's that

272
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,660
all right Lesson Four your reaction

273
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,839
matters more than the ouchy uh I I

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,300
actually had a stunningly those of you

275
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,100
guys that know UFC had a stunningly

276
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,899
interesting conversation with Frank Mir

277
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,480
uh while working for HP a number of

278
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
years ago and he was we're sitting in

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,339
this event that we were hosting that

280
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,980
we're talking about kids and uh he we

281
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,480
get into like because I had you know my

282
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,760
twins are I think just just uh being

283
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,380
born or we just had realized we've been

284
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,880
having twins or something like that but

285
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,800
he's like yeah you know kids are going

286
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,060
to be weird they're going to test you in

287
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,100
ways you don't think I said what do you

288
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,779
mean he goes well you know the first

289
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,120
time my uh my daughter or son I don't

290
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,500
remember anymore but first time my kid

291
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
basically face planted running

292
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,420
that my kid looks up at me and everybody

293
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,459
gasped and I clapped

294
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,660
and he's like and the next thing that

295
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,399
happens my kid gets up wipes the blood

296
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,860
dripping off her face and keeps running

297
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,560
and smiling so what am I saying here the

298
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,120
first time your child Falls they look at

299
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,680
you for the reaction

300
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
okay it's about how you react that

301
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,360
influence the next move they take

302
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820
whether they break out into tears or

303
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,220
whether they simply keep going now this

304
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,200
becomes a learned reaction over time

305
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
okay so they know that if they're in

306
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,820
trouble and they get hurt or something

307
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,680
happens they're gonna play on Mom and

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,380
Dad sympathy and they win so if you

309
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,200
remain calm and steady your customers

310
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
will too and this is why this applies to

311
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,720
like incident response downtime

312
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,779
Parenthood right resist the urge to

313
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,500
freak out uh it is not easy

314
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,060
um because I did not get the benefit of

315
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,820
having like one kid learning from it and

316
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,380
then having another one and then not

317
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,959
panicking on that one I did it both at

318
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,519
the same time which if anybody tells you

319
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
that's like having two kids just slap

320
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,700
them for me

321
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,320
um it's not it's nothing like that uh

322
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
it's it's incredibly different so

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,779
resist the urge to panic because

324
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,380
um

325
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,079
when you do that the people around you

326
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,360
work off of your reaction so the

327
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,260
takeaway in this one is that appearances

328
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,620
matter your response matters

329
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,800
and think of it this way right

330
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,140
um I'll give you guys an example many

331
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,519
some of you have heard this many many

332
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,959
years ago

333
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
um worked in a at a company we had a

334
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,640
reverse proxy to I uh to uh exchange

335
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,160
server five five for Outlook web access

336
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
yes that was like 17 dog years ago

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,240
um

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
and if by the way if you remember

339
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
exchange five five do not tell anybody

340
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
else how old we are

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,579
um it will totally make us not cool but

342
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,279
uh we had reverse proxies in front of

343
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,440
them the person that managed them with

344
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
these two Apache reverse proxies with

345
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,100
some security rules on them maybe even

346
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,899
mod security I don't remember uh had

347
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,240
left the company one day we come in

348
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,500
nobody can get to owa and here we are

349
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,720
absolutely just completely like okay

350
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
we'll go investigate we we're clueless

351
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,300
um I walked down to the data center I

352
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,279
pull the keyboard out flip the monitor

353
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
open and monitor monitor on uh one of

354
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,240
the two reverse proxies which by the way

355
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,820
are round robin in terms of how they uh

356
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,279
how they proxy the screen says if you're

357
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,779
reading this I've compromised your

358
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,060
machine but failed to get a shell sorry

359
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,579
try again it's like okay that was weird

360
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,779
uh but you know

361
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,079
um things happen and at that point you

362
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,700
know my colleague standing next to me

363
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,380
starts absolutely panicking he's like oh

364
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,339
my God what are you gonna do who you can

365
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,540
tell how are we going to make it I mean

366
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,800
this is not an incident like hold on

367
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,079
like it's not a big deal like the person

368
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,060
that broke in is telling us hey I broke

369
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,100
your stuff but but uh I didn't I didn't

370
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,139
get anything out of it and then so we

371
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,079
restored we did a little forensicating

372
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,079
uh realized nothing nothing had been as

373
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,760
much as he could back then uh nothing

374
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,320
had been infiltrated nothing had been

375
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,660
stolen and we moved on and we chatted it

376
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,180
uh basically you know chalked it up to a

377
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,279
uh a continuity issue we had a server

378
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,100
break no big deal but if we would have

379
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,560
freaked out like he had and and you know

380
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,060
declared instant and everything by the

381
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,220
time Everybody by the time the smoke

382
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,420
settled that we would have come to the

383
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,579
conclusion we came to later which is it

384
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,740
wasn't really that big of a deal nobody

385
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,060
would have cared it would have all been

386
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,800
everywhere

387
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
okay

388
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,060
this one's a little uh this one's a

389
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,380
little it's a little close to home

390
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,420
because it's about kids uh and a little

391
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,120
bit of ourselves uh so they know better

392
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,459
but they're gonna do it anyway all right

393
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,899
and

394
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,420
here's where this I think gets really

395
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,959
weird for us kids you will tell them in

396
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,399
fact I you know I had lunch with them

397
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,540
and I was like hey um don't start that

398
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,040
quick spark until you finished your

399
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,139
sandwiches I know Dad I turned around

400
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,120
for 30 seconds and there's a bite out of

401
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,060
this book smart okay she knew better

402
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,940
then anyway like I'm pretty sure she

403
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,440
didn't care

404
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,940
um your users by the way are the same

405
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,279
and if you think it's just your users I

406
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,779
will tell you every single one of you

407
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,579
including myself included in this will

408
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,740
do the same thing so two words

409
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,260
compensating controls so if you've ever

410
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,360
used the phrase I'm not supposed to do

411
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
that but and don't pretend you have it

412
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,420
right whether it's having that you know

413
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,000
uh fourth Burger uh that gas station

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
burrito uh that last beer uh even though

415
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,699
you're totally good uh whatever it is

416
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,440
you know the donut

417
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,639
um don't pretend that you haven't done

418
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,220
it we've all done it we know better we

419
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,779
know we shouldn't have that cup of

420
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,100
coffee at nine PM because you're not

421
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,839
going to sleep all night but we do it

422
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,440
anyway and so recognize that this is

423
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,980
human nature okay this is absolutely the

424
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,920
way we are we are wired this way it is

425
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,199
not going to take it is going to take

426
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,000
something completely different than what

427
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,360
we do today to unwire that so what is

428
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,360
the impact well sometimes you get away

429
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,459
with it right sometimes my kids know

430
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,959
better

431
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,480
and I don't notice and they just get

432
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,699
away with it and you know what that's

433
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,699
all right but sometimes yeah don't

434
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,620
um we all know that friend that left the

435
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,660
bar and said no I'm good I just had that

436
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,000
one and uh then somebody's got to go

437
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,399
bail him out of jail or God forbid

438
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,820
something worse right they knew better

439
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,920
they were told better

440
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,660
in fact they probably went through the

441
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,399
same defensive driving and watched the

442
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,500
same ads on TV that said don't do that

443
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,899
and they did it anyway why because we

444
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,060
think we're impervious and superhuman

445
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,160
now I will tell you this is the reason

446
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,540
why like eight out of 10 Security

447
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,440
Professionals click on phishing emails

448
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,399
because we know better right

449
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,699
awfully quiet in that room

450
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,079
I I think this may be because we're all

451
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,540
doing a little self-reflection so look

452
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,360
we provide training but training does

453
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,339
not a behavior change make you guys

454
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,959
agree at least more or less

455
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,339
so

456
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,380
look training is not the same as

457
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,240
behavioral change giving somebody

458
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,820
whether it's your developers whether

459
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,559
it's your end users whether it's your

460
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,599
kids hell at this point whether it's my

461
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,339
parents because they're in their 70s

462
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,380
using technology that I'm pretty sure

463
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,059
they didn't grow up with

464
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,020
um

465
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,959
telling them don't do this showing them

466
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,059
what happens when they do this that does

467
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,640
not change behaviors repetition changes

468
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,099
behavior consequences change behavior

469
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,839
training does not change Behavior

470
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,579
anybody that's tried to do developer

471
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,439
training once a year in October and then

472
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,380
never again understands what I mean so

473
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,760
assume that they're going to break the

474
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,380
rules why

475
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,260
again human nature right we Implement

476
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,059
compensating controls in these

477
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,660
situations so we go all right look

478
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,340
eight out of ten times they're going to

479
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,440
do the right thing those other two how

480
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,780
do I keep them from you know completely

481
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,100
face planting into this and you can

482
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,600
there's a couple of things you can use

483
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,580
three strikes rules I've seen that done

484
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,600
where like okay the first time you're

485
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,740
like all right

486
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,539
don't do that again as consequences

487
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,340
second time you're like all right no TV

488
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,020
for the weekend third time it's like all

489
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,880
right we're gonna have a different kind

490
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,740
of conversation right

491
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,679
so take away is for me that to you guys

492
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,360
is compensate for the shortcuts people

493
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,039
take shortcuts they're going to they're

494
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,020
going to know how to do better but

495
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,960
sometimes they're under the gun uh

496
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,260
sometimes they're having a bad day

497
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,059
sometimes

498
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:26,460
they're just too Carefree to to really

499
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,380
pay attention and they'll do the wrong

500
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,480
thing and but you know what that's okay

501
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,580
because you do it too and I do it too

502
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,520
and so figure out when you're designing

503
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,460
apps and environments and and things for

504
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,020
developers and heck for yourselves and

505
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,120
for your kids how do you compensate

506
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,059
around that so that when it when they

507
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,860
make the bad choice it doesn't end up

508
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,200
being catastrophic

509
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,720
lesson number six you're the expert but

510
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,880
that's okay you're never right

511
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,740
um and this is the uh the proverbial

512
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,720
frog won't believe it's being boiled uh

513
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
until it's frog legs

514
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,900
so

515
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,120
I I

516
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,220
can't believe how many times I've heard

517
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,799
my kids say Dad but my friend's dad said

518
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:10,260
or my friend said you're like okay but

519
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,760
your friend is the same age as you and

520
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,140
they don't have the life experience I do

521
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,299
what are you doing it it doesn't matter

522
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,520
you are the expert as a parent your kids

523
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,320
will not believe you you know why I know

524
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,460
this because we didn't believe our

525
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
parents stop me if you think I'm wrong

526
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,820
here

527
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,240
so Authority and expertise

528
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
um are cool but unfortunately they're

529
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,280
not absolute they only matter if people

530
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
believe you and they follow what you're

531
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,820
talking about and they follow what you

532
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,100
do so perception of all of this really

533
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,340
matters look I used to do appsec right

534
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,380
not having ever been a developer well

535
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,120
let me put this way not having ever been

536
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
a developer of any consequence uh like I

537
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,980
don't think learning cold fusion matters

538
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,900
and C is was so outdated even by the

539
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,940
time I became a developer like nobody

540
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,179
did it anymore in any consequential way

541
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,039
um perception matters though even though

542
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,260
I I showed up in the in the developers

543
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,480
uh part of the building and said I'm the

544
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,400
expert at how your apps will be hacked

545
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,380
you need to listen to what I'm telling

546
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,120
you they would look at me and go that's

547
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,160
adorable you have no you've never been a

548
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
developer and yeah your security stuff

549
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
that's cool and and I'm sure somebody

550
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,220
will listen to you someday can go away

551
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,640
so proximity matters be in the same

552
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,799
space with them the people that you're

553
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,299
trying to change the behavior of

554
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,280
dictating from an ivory Tower rarely

555
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,720
works out

556
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,780
uh for anybody whether it's uh heads of

557
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,840
state uh uh your parent your parents you

558
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,480
or people in the at the office we all

559
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,580
know that security leader that CSO that

560
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,840
you probably worked for at one point in

561
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,580
time or another that never left their

562
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,500
office never came down to see the common

563
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,840
people uh and people were like yeah I

564
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,039
don't care what that guy says I've never

565
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,299
even actually met him so I don't really

566
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,940
give a crap right relationships matter

567
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,440
and I will tell you the strongest

568
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
relationship you guys can possibly have

569
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,220
is with the people you're trying to

570
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,559
influence and it doesn't have to be a

571
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,039
I'm your Authority just like yeah you

572
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,140
know go out for coffee go out for lunch

573
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,000
commiserate over things that are

574
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,640
absolutely not work related build the

575
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,100
relationships my favorite relationships

576
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
and I fully recognize this makes me a

577
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,520
little weird we're with the lawyers in

578
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,620
my organization ones I learned

579
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,799
because if there's anybody anybody in

580
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,299
the company actually fears it's the

581
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,600
lawyer and eventually HR

582
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,900
so be present meaning be there right

583
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,679
like be in their ear be in their inbox

584
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:38,400
be in their space as often as you can

585
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,140
don't be annoying nobody know but nobody

586
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,120
likes people that are annoying but

587
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,580
gentle reminders throughout the week

588
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,220
right this is why security awareness

589
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
training in October once a year always

590
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,179
always always always fails to have any

591
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,940
lasting impact because we're not present

592
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,640
you jam it into my you know brain for

593
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,740
like a week and then the rest of the

594
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,240
year you're not present I forget about

595
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,460
you right I've got I've got business to

596
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,980
take care of you know at home right if

597
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm if my kids are out playing I have to

598
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,240
check on them and we do it via walking

599
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,799
system because I'm not getting them cell

600
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,780
phones right they're out playing they

601
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,280
can stay out there I just have to remind

602
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,260
them hey guys you guys being good yes

603
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,360
Dad okay what are you doing we're

604
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,500
playing with something like okay what

605
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,700
are you playing well we're throwing

606
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,200
rocks at Windows yeah don't do that

607
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
remember we said until the ring rocks

608
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
like that kind of stuff you have to be

609
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,580
not to my kids don't throw rocks and

610
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,080
windows but you get it

611
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,700
um or maybe they do and I just don't

612
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,280
know but uh you know look you got to be

613
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,919
present and be there be relatable

614
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,100
uh I think that if of all the mistakes

615
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,100
that I can tell you when I implemented

616
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,320
any sort of appsec program or any sort

617
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,600
of apps that could work uh anything that

618
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,700
we did that application related back in

619
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,880
those days and this is arguably quite

620
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,260
some time ago

621
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,179
is we tried to be an authority and

622
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,320
authoritarian

623
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,860
and we were not relatable you P we use

624
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,659
phrases like you people don't know you

625
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,059
you guys just don't know you just don't

626
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,880
understand we're smarter therefore you

627
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,340
should listen to us like that has never

628
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,960
worked in the history of ever and I'm

629
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,299
not sure why earlier on in my career

630
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,799
somebody didn't give me this advice but

631
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,659
I'm hoping that hey you guys already

632
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,460
know it which is great B I'll just

633
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,400
reinforce it please be relatable if they

634
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,080
don't see you as somebody that actually

635
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,900
cares enough to be relatable then it's

636
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,580
not none of this is going to be worth

637
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,220
the crap also be human wrecking again

638
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,380
this is the like hey I get it you've got

639
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,299
other priorities besides me sitting here

640
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,880
telling you to do security

641
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,260
but let me like

642
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,600
I get it okay but how can I make this

643
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
easier on you how can I make it easier

644
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,840
for you to

645
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,559
um

646
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,840
you know do all the things that you that

647
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,179
you supposed to do and also get your job

648
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,460
done how do I get you to deploy faster

649
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,260
like you're supposed to like oh look

650
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,900
none of your metrics to getting paid and

651
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,940
getting your bonus involves security all

652
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,919
right but

653
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,780
work with me here let me show you right

654
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,700
that kind of stuff be human

655
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,240
uh AKA don't be a you know donkey

656
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,100
um the takeaway is your Authority only

657
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
matters to accept it

658
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,380
um how many times have I have we seen uh

659
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,440
kids at you know the playground uh at

660
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,720
the grocery store God help us at a

661
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,280
restaurant where they throw themselves

662
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,260
on the floor and parents like get up or

663
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,940
I also help me and the kid looks at me

664
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,559
and goes yeah you'll do what nothing and

665
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,900
they keep going right because they don't

666
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,059
see the parent as the authority

667
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,880
so look every once in a while you got to

668
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,039
put your foot down and and do the the

669
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,960
thing that is uncomfortable

670
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,539
and that makes you the authority but you

671
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,120
gotta be relatable be present be human

672
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,740
like get them

673
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,140
to accept your Authority and I spent a

674
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,000
lot of time on this one mainly because

675
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it is that important

676
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,260
okay

677
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,360
um lesson seven they love you until you

678
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,340
tell them they'll be prepared to be the

679
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,240
enemy and that's okay okay guys your

680
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,799
kids will be your best friends and

681
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
they'll love you forever as long as you

682
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,860
don't tell them notice something right

683
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,200
that that uh that fourth donut no

684
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,700
problem second handling of ice cream

685
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,340
sure absolutely and then it's like okay

686
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,740
but it is 11 45 and it's bedtime they're

687
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,720
like no you're the worst parent ever

688
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
you're like yeah that's okay get up to

689
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,059
bed

690
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,460
like eventually you have to say no and

691
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,320
it's okay whether that they may not like

692
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,600
you as a result like my kids love me

693
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,940
unconditionally I know that right until

694
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,100
it's time for bed and and we're in the

695
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,779
middle of Mario Kart or we're playing

696
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,720
you know uh whatever games we play

697
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,940
dungeon something or other

698
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,659
um

699
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,360
and and look they're like oh come on one

700
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,600
more round nope one more round nope

701
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,039
never let us like you're right I know

702
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,020
I'm the worst parent ever I make you go

703
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,659
to bed at 10. I'm so terrible all right

704
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,580
let's go up right so

705
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,860
at some point I got to tell them though

706
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,840
and and then you're the bad guy no

707
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
matter how awesome of a day you've had

708
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,860
how awesome of a year you've had what

709
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,600
your great track record is like that

710
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,620
first thing you guys know what I'm

711
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,720
talking about so it's until I make them

712
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,059
go to bed or the word no comes out right

713
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,159
what happens next is really kind of odd

714
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,440
though they can they they tend to turn

715
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,240
Super quickly

716
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,940
but recognize that if you're doing

717
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,820
things for the right reasons you explain

718
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,419
right you're not malicious or mean and

719
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,340
you you explain to them that this is for

720
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,480
their benefit

721
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,460
that animosity tends to be pretty

722
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,860
temporary I tell you this happens in the

723
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,559
business World quite a bit where

724
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,820
um suddenly you take if you've ever

725
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,500
taken away admin access from people's

726
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,140
workstations right it doesn't matter how

727
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,659
awesome uh how awesome that you are how

728
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,880
much they love you you are now the devil

729
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
right you are the worst human being

730
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,700
that's ever walked the Earth because

731
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,320
they can no longer install some Facebook

732
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,480
widget or whatever the hell they do

733
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
these days

734
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,799
and it's amazing but that access being

735
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,179
restricted

736
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,279
that animosity because of it tends to be

737
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,679
temporary so stay the course trust your

738
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
policy what you want is respect now yes

739
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,120
you want to be liked but there's a limit

740
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,580
so be fair

741
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,500
and the takeaway from this one is be

742
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,380
respected always but like usually

743
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,120
and if it comes down to it in a business

744
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,200
environment

745
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
and if I have to choose between somebody

746
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,279
liking me and somebody respecting me

747
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,960
enough to just do you know kind of like

748
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,539
just take my word for it sometimes I'll

749
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:29,880
take the trust the respect and Trust

750
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,460
right they may not always love me and

751
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,779
they don't mean they always even like me

752
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,760
and sometimes they feel like slashing my

753
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,100
tires in the parking lot but ultimately

754
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,260
they know all right yeah this is for the

755
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,620
better good you know whatever jerk like

756
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,380
that happens more than you know

757
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,539
um sometimes you must meet them halfway

758
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,000
or else because you can't fight water

759
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,279
you can only direct it there's a quote

760
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,279
about water uh from Bruce Lee which I I

761
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,440
don't remember anymore but the reality

762
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,000
is

763
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
sometimes you've got to meet people

764
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,740
halfway and in cyber security and life

765
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,840
and everything else if you're an

766
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,100
absolutist you lose so sometimes policy

767
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,840
needs flexibility what does that mean

768
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,179
well look homework is a priority

769
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,460
nobody's going to dispute that

770
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,559
but it's going and you have to get your

771
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,820
homework done before you can go outside

772
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,700
and play but it's going to rain in an

773
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,600
hour

774
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
and you've got about an hour's worth of

775
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,640
homework so I can be the jerk that says

776
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,500
your homework always has to be done

777
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,720
before you go out and play and by the

778
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,159
time you're done it could be raining and

779
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,600
then I'm like oh man now I feel like a

780
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,480
jerk or I can say okay you can go out

781
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,100
and play for an hour that gives you an

782
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,419
hour before bedtime to finish your

783
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,740
homework so now play now but you gotta

784
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,500
promise me right pinky swear that you're

785
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,000
going to do the the thing that I ask you

786
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,380
to when your timer is up now

787
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,000
enforcing that promise is super

788
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,799
important because they'll test those

789
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,900
limitations I promise you

790
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
so

791
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,640
be flexible

792
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,460
but give them a fair alternative but

793
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,500
enforce that alternative to force that

794
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,360
deadline

795
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,980
and this works the same in business

796
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,400
right be appropriately flexible

797
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,480
absolutists always lose and really

798
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,460
nobody likes a dictator

799
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,419
um and there are times look where in in

800
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,760
the release cycles of all the times I

801
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,919
watched apps go out

802
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,240
I

803
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,179
can't think of a single time where I

804
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,120
said nope this app can absolutely not go

805
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,059
out with this thing ever and I won that

806
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,020
argument

807
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,919
it was always a yes but it was always

808
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,260
like you know zero defects never worked

809
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,700
for anybody mainly because I don't think

810
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,620
it's a thing anymore

811
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,740
um but we always had to be flexible on

812
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,659
policy we could say all right

813
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,460
I recognize you made a customer

814
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,580
commitment I also recognize your code is

815
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,700
the effective uh water uh holding water

816
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,520
of Swiss cheese so look where are we

817
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,320
going to meet in the middle here like

818
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,820
all right I'll let you like I'll give

819
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,559
you an extra week

820
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,779
but I'm going to like scrutinize this

821
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,100
thing and I'm gonna stare at it every

822
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,720
day to make sure somebody hasn't broken

823
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,700
it but I'm telling you right now that in

824
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,440
a week if this isn't fixed I'm taking it

825
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,659
off net that's just that simple

826
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,520
and and you have to give that

827
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,960
flexibility

828
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,620
so flex but don't abdicate means just

829
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,659
because you have to be flexible on on

830
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,039
policy doesn't mean you're now

831
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,980
abdicating that the Authority or the the

832
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,740
need to still enforce policy like those

833
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,600
are not mutually exclusive and hopefully

834
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,100
in your world

835
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,620
don't abdicate the fact that you still

836
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,960
have work to do just because you're

837
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,460
trying to be flexible

838
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,620
if you don't strategically bend your

839
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,380
policy will be subverted this is a

840
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,559
unfortunate lesson that time teaches us

841
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,140
um and you know like look I I've been

842
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,500
there where you say absolutely not uh

843
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,179
and they find and you know whoever is is

844
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,520
trying to get around it uh we'll do one

845
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,779
of a couple of things that will work

846
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,279
they'll find somebody with a higher

847
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,140
authority than you that doesn't know the

848
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,059
situation that will allow them to get

849
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,700
away with it and then you're screwed or

850
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,559
they'll smile and Nod

851
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,080
and then figure out a way in it like

852
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,000
again one you weren't expecting or the

853
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,980
one you've never seen coming to subvert

854
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,440
you or next time they simply won't come

855
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,299
to you or they'll find a way around your

856
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,600
policy that is not what you want right

857
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,299
and the takeaway is Grant linear

858
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,620
exception doesn't say Grant no

859
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,779
exceptions it doesn't say do you let

860
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:38,159
people do whatever you want just grant

861
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,080
limited exceptions

862
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,620
because the world unfortunately is not

863
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,980
black white yes no wrong right right

864
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,440
there are millions of Shades of Gray in

865
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,179
in this thing that we do for a living

866
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:52,340
and

867
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,500
you have to give people flexibility to

868
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,360
get their job done to accomplish goals

869
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,120
while also getting as close to what we

870
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,640
want as possible Right the most secure

871
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,100
application the most secure asset or

872
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,620
system is the one that's unusable so

873
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,020
we've got to find a way through it

874
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,880
all right lesson number nine be a friend

875
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,980
in Authority but know the difference

876
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,340
because much like your kids people will

877
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,620
take advantage of you if you let them

878
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,960
here's what I mean kids do need

879
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,480
absolutely need balance right

880
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,140
um

881
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,820
they shall go on the name but I have

882
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,820
friends that have kids who uh who want

883
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,860
to be you never want their kids mad at

884
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,179
them God forbid they want to be their

885
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,640
kids buddies and their kids were an

886
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,620
absolute rough shot over them they do

887
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,600
whatever they want because God forbid

888
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,220
mom and dad say no

889
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,140
so they want to be their friend but

890
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,179
you've got to know the limitations this

891
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,520
is the same in the business world

892
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,159
and sometimes you'll have to be the ah

893
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,520
dad guy like I am I'm that all the time

894
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,399
guess what they still love me I think

895
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,039
and so be your customers buddy you know

896
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,480
who your customers right your everybody

897
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,520
that's not you in the organization or

898
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,700
your actual customer be their buddy but

899
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,980
also know that there are boundaries to

900
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,840
that right you want to be sympathetic

901
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,640
you want to be empathetic you want to be

902
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,880
uh be able to understand their plight

903
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,220
and their cause like I man I I know you

904
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,140
got to get this thing out I know you

905
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,240
were out sick for a week and I know now

906
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,860
you have absolutely no time to do any of

907
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,279
the security precautions I get that

908
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,860
maybe we can work something out

909
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,500
but I can't let you just like let this

910
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,880
thing go because it is going to be a

911
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
train wreck I'm sorry right our job is

912
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,799
relationships

913
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,620
and without them we're tyrants

914
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,159
and every tyrant in history including

915
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,740
the one over in the uh that eastern part

916
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,260
of Europe right now meets the exact same

917
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,080
and not a sufficiently long timeline

918
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,240
right they end up in a bad place

919
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,760
rapidly and so coaching counsel is

920
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,140
important but enforce limitations

921
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,620
allow people to have the benefit of a

922
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,119
shoulder to cry on

923
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,980
and then nudge them back in the right

924
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,599
direction

925
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,699
the takeaway is I think the thing that

926
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,219
we suck at in this profession

927
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,960
um and maybe it's because of kind of the

928
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,599
the quirky nature of of the way we think

929
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,040
and the way our brains work or the kind

930
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,020
of people that are drawn into this

931
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,040
profession

932
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,440
and I know I get sideways glances when I

933
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,300
say this but we are not good at

934
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,520
generally at relationships in the long

935
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,760
run and we've got to get better we have

936
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,739
this Us Versus Them thing I I don't know

937
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,599
if you've noticed but that was how cyber

938
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,359
began it was us versus them like the

939
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,859
whole I'm gonna dress differently talk

940
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,960
differently I'm gonna act differently

941
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,359
than all of you other normal people

942
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,119
because I'm cooler than you it got us to

943
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,879
the place we sit at today where a lot of

944
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,980
people simply do not respect the weirdos

945
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,940
in the other part of the building

946
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,560
because nobody understands what they're

947
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,920
saying and they're absolute tyrants

948
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,200
we could argue that point but it is true

949
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,900
about 80 of the places I've been in in

950
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,119
terms of consulting or worked in in the

951
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,220
last 25 years

952
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,220
if we don't Master relationships none of

953
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,140
this other crap matters if you don't

954
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,640
Master the relationship with your kids

955
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,359
with your uh with your their teachers uh

956
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,240
your friends your neighbors right none

957
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,000
of this matters because none of it will

958
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,800
work

959
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,140
and so the final one here is tomorrow

960
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,359
won't be better or worse it's just going

961
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,740
to be different

962
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,140
um and maturity brings different types

963
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,540
of disaster scenarios

964
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,460
um I'll I'll explain in a second so

965
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,740
parents to be always ask me the

966
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,720
following thing like hey it was is nine

967
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,119
easier than when they were two and my

968
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,920
answer is always the same nope it's just

969
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,820
different

970
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,140
right

971
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,540
um one of my kids pediatricians at one

972
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,520
point said we spend as parents we spend

973
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,320
the first two to three years teaching

974
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,760
them to walk and talk and then the next

975
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,020
18 to sit down and shut up

976
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,220
yeah that's what I thought you know I

977
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,300
figured you all get a good laugh at that

978
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,940
one it tell me that's not true though

979
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,680
like once they learn to talk you're like

980
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,300
oh my God why did I teach you this

981
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,119
because you now do not shut up right and

982
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,300
that and you know much for us right so

983
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,880
is the age of two any different than the

984
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,300
age of nine uh I mean yeah dramatically

985
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,119
is it is it like less stressful oh God

986
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,579
no because at two you know I was making

987
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:31,380
sure my kids didn't accidentally fall

988
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,780
down the stairs or like impale

989
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,880
themselves on the corner of some uh of

990
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,339
some table now I worry about like oh

991
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,020
they're out on their bikes riding like

992
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,480
hey are they gonna get run out of the

993
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,720
street or uh or or on on you know as

994
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,280
they're playing on Roblox are they gonna

995
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,500
get you know talked up by some creepo

996
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,200
right adult somewhere like we have way

997
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,480
different problems they're not any

998
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,800
better or worse they're just different

999
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800
and this is kind of as companies mature

1000
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,680
as your staff matures as your i-team at

1001
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,000
yours as your security matures the

1002
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,680
problems don't get better or worse they

1003
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,500
just get different and you have to adapt

1004
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,660
the challenges of two the challenges at

1005
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,000
eight the challenge is at 18. way

1006
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,900
different

1007
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,180
in their own little way right the risks

1008
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,619
shift

1009
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,160
the risk at two or at one really right

1010
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,260
is choking on the blanket or rolling

1011
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,359
over and suffocating or something and

1012
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,400
that's why parents don't sleep the first

1013
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,579
three years ten years

1014
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:33,180
um 18 years and but but eventually you

1015
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,300
want like you know you you wonder not

1016
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,579
are are they asleep and safe but why is

1017
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:41,760
it 11 45 that you know the car should

1018
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
have been in the garage 15 minutes ago

1019
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,660
oh my God what happened right that's

1020
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,339
where your brain goes the threats are

1021
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,320
different the challenges are different

1022
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,660
as your org matures this absolutely

1023
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,480
applies bigger companies bigger problems

1024
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,800
smaller companies smaller problems

1025
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,599
they're all problems

1026
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,359
you know we used to say like hey back in

1027
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,099
the day when there was you know we just

1028
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,420
all had a team wanted a firewall

1029
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,579
security was easy no it wasn't it was

1030
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,099
just as hard back then we didn't

1031
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,839
understand the scope of the problem now

1032
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,359
yes I do long for days where you know

1033
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,980
data didn't live in the cloud and on

1034
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,720
everybody's mobile device everywhere in

1035
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,520
the world like I could point to it and

1036
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,780
say those two hard drives have our

1037
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,820
corporate data that was easy right I

1038
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,280
believe me I long for those days uh they

1039
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,700
are gone uh and but the problems we face

1040
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,859
today are different

1041
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,780
um and it's and it's really interesting

1042
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,820
right we have different problems we have

1043
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,680
different threats and the scope is

1044
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,920
wildly different of these problems you

1045
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,200
know the scope when they're when the

1046
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,880
program is Young

1047
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,040
is the people that are that you can talk

1048
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,920
to directly and see right there so over

1049
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,140
time it evolves to like this huge

1050
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,760
landscape of

1051
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,480
developers customers infra people

1052
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,200
Ops people you know legal counsel CEOs

1053
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,359
like everybody and it's completely

1054
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,400
different so security challenges change

1055
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,280
and security teams must have to adapt

1056
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,579
the threats challenges uh and change as

1057
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,400
the org matures right and the one lesson

1058
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,140
here is the rock that won't move is a

1059
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,000
one away slowly

1060
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,540
um

1061
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,640
if if you are standing in the river

1062
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,040
saying no I'm not going to change I

1063
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,200
don't care what you say that water will

1064
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,700
wear you away and what you will be as

1065
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,820
fired or irrelevant or both uh and I've

1066
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,720
met both

1067
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,220
so

1068
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,960
um that's a little bit about me I think

1069
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,560
I'm right about on time uh I don't know

1070
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,940
