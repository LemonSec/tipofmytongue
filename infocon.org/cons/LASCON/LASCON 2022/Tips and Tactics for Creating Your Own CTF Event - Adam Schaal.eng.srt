my name is Adam Shaw and I'm here to

7
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,199
talk to you about tips and tactics for

8
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,260
creating your own CTF event

9
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,239
um

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,280
a little bit about me I made product

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,979
security manager at AWS I have a decade

12
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,840
of experience making and breaking

13
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
applications

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,740
um I am really involved in my community

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,260
uh there's a conference in Omaha

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,060
Nebraska called kernel con which I

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,759
helped found and run I also run my local

18
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,020
Defcon group

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,220
and I have a open source CTF framework

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,900
um which you know you're welcome to

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,720
check out bug me about open open feature

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
requests uh and last year I had the

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,220
pleasure of helping local mocosec a

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,159
conference in Hawaii get off the ground

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,619
with their website and helped organize

26
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,280
that here's a few of my social media

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,900
links if you

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,960
um while I'm still on Twitter and uh you

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
know if you want to follow my work

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,939
a little bit about me when my experience

31
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,299
with ctfs I've organized over a dozen

32
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,119
ctfs at different levels

33
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,000
when I was in college I organized high

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,719
school ctfs for recruiting

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,520
employer ctfs for educating software and

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,160
security teams and conference ctfs for

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,620
educating and stumping attendees these

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,020
are some of my most recent ctips I

39
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,739
helped with or put together I two of the

40
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,819
sponsors here I helped create ctfs for

41
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,220
and that's my con I ran the CTF for the

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,319
last three years and that's the Defcon

43
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,879
appsec Village I've submitted a few CTF

44
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,900
challenges to that so if you went to

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,459
Defcon this year and participated in the

46
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,459
appsec village CTF probably solve one or

47
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,040
two of my challenges

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,459
uh so I I imagine that a lot of people

49
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,860
in this room know what ctfs are but I

50
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,959
did you know I was a social butterfly

51
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,000
walking around and and when people would

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
ask what I was speaking about and I told

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
them about ctfs I did get some questions

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,319
so just a quick kind of high-level

55
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,599
introduction uh and then I'll describe

56
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,220
why I think that's important while

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,540
they're important

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,480
um what is the CTF well it's a it's

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,280
that's an abbreviation obviously for

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
capture the flag event bless you

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,959
and uh it's a competition that takes

62
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,640
major disciplines of information

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,099
security and breaks them into smaller

64
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,800
objectively measurable exercises right

65
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,739
participants or contestants they attempt

66
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,480
to solve the challenges by exploiting

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,239
breaking other cyber security tradecraft

68
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,220
um and there's two main types there's uh

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,220
Jeopardy and there's attack defend

70
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,220
now Jeopardy style CTF you might see

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,200
something that looks like this

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
um basically participants are presented

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
with a Jeopardy board filled with

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,440
categories and challenges at varying

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,299
Point levels as you go down the

76
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,400
challenge board into the more

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,019
um

78
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,659
into the the higher Point levels the

79
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,819
challenges will get more difficult you

80
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,280
can see based on like this board

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,140
you can almost see that effect right you

82
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,580
could see all the green at the top and

83
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,040
there's more white at the bottom

84
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,739
um and as the challenge is solved the

85
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,599
team earns points associated with each

86
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,680
Challenge and they move up to

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,900
leaderboard accordingly

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,480
um in Jeopardy style ctfs ties are often

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,580
broken by whoever achieved The Score

90
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,519
first and um I would say that these are

91
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,680
still today the most common form of

92
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,839
cyber security competitions

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,100
uh there's also attack defend ctfs now

94
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,979
these are quite different in structure

95
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,840
each team is scored based on the amount

96
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,300
of time they keep their services up so

97
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,940
you have these teams at the top here and

98
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,560
then you have their services at the

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,320
bottom uh so in this example here team

100
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,720
one they're defending their own Services

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,120
their services are provided to them by

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,160
the organizers of the event

103
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,900
and they're often intentionally

104
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,440
vulnerable so team one has to figure out

105
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,740
how to defend it but anytime they find a

106
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,600
vulnerability that they patch they also

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,300
try to exploit that vulnerability

108
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,400
against these other teams this is a

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
common uh CTF format at larger

110
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,940
conferences like Defcon so I helped

111
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,740
write challenges for the appsec village

112
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,139
CTF that was the Jeopardy style board

113
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,020
but the main event the main CTF they

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,440
they do an attack defend type of CTF and

115
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
this is

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,340
um this is uh probably what can what

117
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,900
people would consider to be like a more

118
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,340
well-rounded

119
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,740
um CTF uh whereas the Jeopardy style

120
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,940
you're able to focus in on particular

121
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,280
particular aspects of security and you

122
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
know knock them out one by one from an

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
educational standpoint especially from

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
like the lens of developers I actually

125
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
believe that the Jeopardy style CTF is

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,419
best because there each participant is

127
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,580
focused on challenging themselves and

128
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,620
not their competitors right they're

129
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,360
they're learning their they're learning

130
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,039
for themselves

131
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,160
um and so thus for the the purposes of

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,020
this presentation I'm going to just

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,620
mostly refer to Jeopardy Style ctfs

134
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,660
so that's that's kind of like the

135
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,240
breakdown of what is the CTF

136
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,460
um what are the main types what you can

137
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,500
expect uh and I'm going to talk to you a

138
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,039
little bit about the importance of a CTF

139
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,840
so let's talk a little bit about

140
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
security awareness training all right

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
um I'm going to ask you a question here

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,919
which segment of these employees are

143
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,060
most crucial to train with security

144
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,400
um security awareness right human I

145
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,539
could see Arguments for all three of

146
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,940
these Human Resources

147
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,860
um they have information to every

148
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,020
employee they have all the employees

149
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,960
information the finance they control the

150
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,520
money of the company

151
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,979
the engineering team they're they're the

152
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,840
ones building the products of the

153
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,199
company right and so the the product you

154
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,660
know reaches out and and if it's dog

155
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,120
 then uh it's you know unfortunately

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,220
going to reflect negatively on the

157
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,240
company

158
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
um and or lead to vulnerabilities so

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
potentially could compromise uh the

160
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,199
others as well with that so I could see

161
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,060
an argument for all three of these but

162
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,340
let me ask you this question

163
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,979
which of these groups are most likely to

164
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,020
skip or not pay attention to the

165
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,520
training

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380
and and this is where it requires

167
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,660
audience participation so everyone raise

168
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,759
your hand if you've ever done uh

169
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,680
security awareness training like in a

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,740
video deck or like a slideshow or

171
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,440
anything that just awful it took hours

172
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,479
of your life all right now keep your

173
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,500
hand up

174
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,319
if you found out a way to break that

175
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,419
mechanism like open the JavaScript

176
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,180
console and you know made it auto

177
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,220
clicker yeah look at all these hands up

178
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,080
okay these are the people these are the

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,639
 that I'm talking about all of

180
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,539
you guys

181
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,319
all right because when I ask who is the

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,620
most likely to to uh not follow that

183
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,120
training and figure out a way around it

184
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,300
it's people like you and developers it's

185
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,460
not HR and finance they're going to

186
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,319
diligently sit there for four hours and

187
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,419
listen to every little line that the the

188
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,979
slideshow says and they'll click next

189
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,840
when they when they can appropriately

190
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,979
click next

191
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,000
but

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,340
engineers and developers and

193
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,139
um you know security members they're

194
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,099
going to find their way around it

195
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,720
because they they don't have to they

196
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,419
don't want to waste four hours right so

197
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,879
I guess

198
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,940
the next questions are then is your

199
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,860
current security awareness training the

200
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,960
most effective it can be

201
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,899
and does your technical staff view

202
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,958
security awareness training as a chore

203
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,260
all right I think that those

204
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,599
um types of training that I described I

205
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,919
think people view that as a chore

206
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,500
especially our community

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,420
and so

208
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,959
I'd like to propose CTF events as a

209
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,540
possible alternative

210
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,279
um one possible way to motivate your

211
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,300
engineering staff is through

212
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,560
gamification

213
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,339
in a recent survey uh 79 of security

214
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,680
awareness training participants they

215
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,839
indicated that they'd be more productive

216
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,880
and motivated if their learning was more

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,260
like a game

218
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,519
right and and not like uh how fast I can

219
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,279
click this next button and and and when

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,339
when uh the browser you know

221
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,220
um makes it clickable again

222
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,899
so

223
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,940
let's talk about potential outcomes from

224
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,160
a from a CTF event right

225
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,500
this is I think I think that this is

226
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,519
these are all great outcomes uh first

227
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,080
you're going to have engaged training

228
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,019
with volunteer volunteer involvement

229
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,600
right it's opt-in people who want to

230
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,880
participate you know they have to sign

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,839
up and come and you know form a team uh

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,000
teaching developers and Architects to

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
think like a bad actor that's only going

234
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,380
to help them in their jobs when they go

235
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,899
and they when they go and they work on

236
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:59,820
um you know building out features threat

237
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,399
modeling themselves knowing how to think

238
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,260
like a bad actor that's only going to

239
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,459
help them

240
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,100
also if you're a application security

241
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,560
team which is generally where when I

242
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,120
wrote these

243
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,399
um you become well known with all the

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,160
engineers who who uh attend your event

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,200
and that's a big deal because

246
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
application security Engineers are at

247
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,540
their best when they're empathetic and

248
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,459
they're you know they can understand and

249
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,560
work with the engineering team

250
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,399
um

251
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,980
I've heard this uh philosophy of no

252
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,700
right that that people say that comes

253
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,100
from a security team a lot of developers

254
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,380
think that the security team is just

255
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,300
somebody who who gets in their way or

256
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
something you have to throw over the

257
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,779
wall to them and wait for feedback but

258
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,820
if they know you if they know it they

259
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,200
can point to that person and say hey

260
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
John you know like uh you know I want to

261
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,579
go talk to you and

262
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,560
um maybe grab lunch with you and and by

263
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,420
the way what do you think about this

264
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,640
feature that I'm implementing like that

265
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,839
is something that's going to benefit

266
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,120
everybody in your organization

267
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,839
and also I mean let's be honest it

268
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,000
allows the application security team to

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
demonstrate their expertise

270
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
uh a lot of times developers and

271
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,240
engineers and Architects they have no

272
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,000
idea what we do but then if you put them

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,620
in front of a challenge and you say go

274
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,500
exploit this SQL injection and they

275
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,899
don't know how they're doing uh I mean

276
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,000
it allows the application security team

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,459
to become the experts in the room so

278
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,980
you're becoming friends with them you're

279
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,899
demonstrating your expertise you're

280
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,060
teaching them and you have engaged

281
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,320
training

282
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,420
so I think these are potential great

283
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,760
outcomes

284
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
so now that I've described why I think a

285
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,779
CTF is important I'm going to describe

286
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,600
how to create one right because creating

287
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,120
a CTF can be an intimidating

288
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,720
aspect

289
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,440
first

290
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,180
know your audience

291
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,399
what are the experience levels are they

292
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,380
all a particular type of developer I

293
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,899
mean if I'm training front-end Engineers

294
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:04,860
only

295
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,320
I would never give them a privilege

296
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,260
escalation on a Linux box necessarily

297
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,420
right if they're going to have different

298
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,360
learning objectives than a OS engineer

299
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,740
or a back-end engineer or a mobile

300
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,720
engineer

301
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,579
um and then what's the desired output

302
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,640
what are we trying to train right think

303
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,000
about you know your last year

304
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,100
did you have a lot of one particular

305
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,620
vulnerability SEC uh like

306
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,040
um feature and and and think okay we're

307
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,079
really bad at authentication mechanisms

308
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,240
so we need to train on that and we need

309
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,560
to work on that so I'm going to build

310
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,519
out lots of authentication challenges

311
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,220
um or I'm going to focus in on

312
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,180
you know uh xss because

313
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,579
um we're always working on fixing our

314
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,139
cross-site scripting issues because

315
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,720
we're reflecting outputs to the web and

316
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,959
nobody's sanitizing it and it's just you

317
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,000
know Cowboy season everyone's doing

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,800
whatever they want and so we're always

319
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,420
having to fix it

320
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,620
so that's that's step one step two then

321
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,000
is now that you know your audience and

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,040
you know your desired outcomes is to

323
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,500
select your CTF categories and I'm going

324
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,820
to stay on the screen for a little bit

325
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,320
because I want to describe each of these

326
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,200
in good detail detail enough that you

327
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,620
you could know yourself like what the

328
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,660
outcomes are what what would fit that

329
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,180
outcome so here's seven categories

330
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,100
there's more than these in the wild but

331
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,380
I stick to these seven generally

332
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,660
speaking and I do that because I have a

333
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,139
miscellaneous category so uh you know

334
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,300
um but web these type of challenges

335
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,579
utilize websites they're typically like

336
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,399
an owasp top 10 vulnerability and or

337
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,139
misconfigurations

338
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,660
oftentimes these have an extremely low

339
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,180
barrier of Entry so

340
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,880
um everyone uses websites every day uh

341
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,500
easier vulnerabilities are highly

342
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,320
publicized people have a good level of

343
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,240
experience with navigating through a

344
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,279
website

345
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,860
um forensics forensics challenges cover

346
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,440
a wide range of challenges uh sometimes

347
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,200
they involve steganography hiding things

348
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,420
in pictures

349
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,519
reconnaissance work malformed files I

350
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,959
have to network if the networking

351
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,940
category is not filled out a lot of

352
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,500
times they might involve a networking

353
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,820
challenge

354
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,420
um

355
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,540
and uh when there's not enough for a

356
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,399
full forensics category some Sometimes

357
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,420
some of these challenges could be

358
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,920
dropped into the miscellaneous category

359
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,260
uh again it's a low barrier of Entry

360
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,820
because there are a lot of Open Source

361
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,980
forensics tools to utilize

362
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,540
um I think there's

363
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,260
15 steganography tools that I've that I

364
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,779
like will use in a CTF

365
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,060
um and if it's usually not one of those

366
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,980
15 that solves the challenge for me I'm

367
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,880
I I don't solve it but there's at least

368
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,760
I think 15 different steganography open

369
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,079
source programs that you could just

370
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,600
download and play with and you know try

371
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,220
to analyze an image

372
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,320
uh the miscellaneous category it's

373
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,060
exactly what it sounds like it's a place

374
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,620
to put challenges

375
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,220
um in in case there's not a lot of uh uh

376
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,300
in case you can't fill out another

377
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,579
category however I'm highlighting it

378
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,019
because

379
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,779
um I think it's also a good place to put

380
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,459
a couple of non-technical challenges

381
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,459
right which helps ensure that the CTF is

382
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,800
beginner friendly uh you don't want to

383
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,600
you don't want to be intimidating to

384
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,680
start with

385
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,660
um one of the things I like to do is I

386
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,300
put a 500 Point very detailed crossword

387
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,360
puzzle in the miscellaneous category why

388
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,579
500 points is the highest that you could

389
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,399
get but also it takes a significant

390
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,399
amount of time to figure out each clue

391
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,560
and uh somebody on the team who's not

392
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,420
the most technical person they can spend

393
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,339
two hours doing it and get 500 points

394
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,199
for their team and feel like they've

395
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,940
like contributed not only have they

396
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,980
contributed they've hit a maximum point

397
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,620
value and uh they had they didn't spend

398
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,040
all day you know working

399
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,899
above their their level I guess I would

400
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,079
say so it's a great place for not for

401
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:09,360
less technical challenges

402
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
and

403
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,860
um and that's you know that's a perfect

404
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,040
place if you have if this is an open

405
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,899
call for people not just focused on

406
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,000
developers and you know you have those

407
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
HR and finance people who want to

408
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,600
participate that's a perfect place to

409
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,959
put a lot more like detailed challenges

410
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,699
where they can go and they can learn or

411
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,380
have trivia like they can go and figure

412
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,899
out like what does it mean when your

413
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,120
input box is not sanitized and then they

414
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,279
reflect input back to the web page you

415
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,579
know what does that mean and so somebody

416
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:43,800
who's not super technical can really do

417
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
shine in that category

418
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,240
uh cryptography this category involves

419
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
higher levels of mathematics

420
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,320
cryptography is a great category because

421
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
contestants use cryptography in their

422
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
professional lives every day and they

423
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,259
often don't even think about it right

424
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,440
and you know you connect to https how

425
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,420
many of you like know how TLS works like

426
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,099
off the top of your head

427
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:09,119
um yeah okay Mark yeah some of you do

428
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,859
um some of you do

429
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,199
um but uh uh a lot of times you don't

430
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,939
think about it right and unless that's

431
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,160
your job and so the barrier for entry is

432
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,359
a little higher here because not

433
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,679
everybody has experience with that

434
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,260
levels of math but that said you can

435
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,959
make easier Cipher challenges also at

436
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,720
the beginning like um Caesar ciphers or

437
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,419
uh substitution ciphers

438
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,640
uh reverse engineering that's one of the

439
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,140
more difficult categories to approach if

440
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,940
you don't have experience in it a

441
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,580
typical CTF challenge is a binary that

442
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,320
has a method to return a flag that's

443
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,480
buried inside of you know C code and

444
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,539
then obfuscated and compiled and

445
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,520
participants must actually like parse

446
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
through the binary and reverse engineer

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,220
it and so they could figure out how to

448
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,919
call the flag or or form it through the

449
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,120
binary

450
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,240
um this is uh that is a hard challenge I

451
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,600
when I'm doing educational ctfs I rarely

452
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
have a reverse engineering challenge

453
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,299
that's

454
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,760
I'd say higher than 200 points because I

455
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,100
want people to understand like the basic

456
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,960
concepts but also it's not really their

457
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,940
job if they're a developer to reverse

458
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,799
engineer binaries that's that's more on

459
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,380
the security side anyway

460
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,500
um networking uh this is this again this

461
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,820
category is relatively specific

462
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,400
occasionally gets rolled into forensics

463
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,440
um it encompasses all disciplines of

464
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,760
network engineering and commonly

465
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,820
utilizes like packet captures

466
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,740
um packet captures are uh you know

467
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,080
capturing Network traffic

468
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,539
um if you're familiar with Wireshark you

469
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,700
know what a packet capture is and uh

470
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,400
sometimes they'll hide Flags within a

471
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,380
packet capture that you have to go find

472
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,320
or figure out like how to analyze the

473
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,200
traffic in order to extrapolate a flag

474
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,419
and then the last challenge this is what

475
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,460
when I was talking to people about ctfs

476
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,919
a lot of people thought I meant only

477
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,620
pone and exploit challenges this is

478
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,380
something like hack the Box

479
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,840
um where you're essentially

480
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,900
misuse or breaking into something

481
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,780
um outside your Access Control right uh

482
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,880
if you've heard of the oscp or hack the

483
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,559
box that's very similar to this

484
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:17,520
basically you're breaking into a uh a

485
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,140
computer and you're escalating your

486
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,179
privileges until you own that that box

487
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,240
or that service this is another thing

488
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
that

489
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,440
uh I don't know if I'd have a a ton of

490
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
on an educational security awareness

491
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,880
type of training because

492
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,620
um while it teaches you something it

493
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,780
covers all the disciplines and you know

494
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,660
and not every developer is well versed

495
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,340
in every single discipline they know

496
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,160
their their bag usually

497
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,260
um but that's enough on categories

498
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,200
this is a fun part right uh it might

499
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,720
sound unimportant but CTF contest

500
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,600
contests are definitely enhanced when

501
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,460
there's a challenge that circles around

502
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,480
a theme

503
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,640
and the theming the CTF makes each

504
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,039
challenge a fun story usually includes a

505
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,620
goal this is vital because good CTF

506
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,840
challenges tell a story they give the

507
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,520
participants a reason to attack a

508
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,660
challenge

509
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,700
um you know and it's also a way that a

510
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,580
Creator can give away hints

511
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,460
and at a bare minimum it gives the

512
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,059
contestants like a direction right

513
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,059
um here are some popular themes when

514
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,580
I've been involved in ctfs

515
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,539
like Jurassic Park or Back to the Future

516
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,340
you also have like you have a good guy

517
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,260
and a bad guy right your bad guy is

518
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,260
nedry he up the it Network he

519
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,080
wasn't paid enough uh and he screwed

520
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,179
everything up and now you need to bring

521
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,220
the bring the services back up in

522
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,440
Jurassic Park you need to crack his

523
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,559
website and get into his password

524
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,240
manager you need to break into his

525
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,700
computer to turn off the fences or to

526
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,919
Electrify the fences again you know all

527
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,620
kinds of challenges present themselves

528
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,799
because of uh because of having like a

529
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,880
you know an antagonist and you know uh

530
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,740
Back to the Future there's there's Biff

531
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,140
right and and you can have a number of

532
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,880
different um challenges that revolve

533
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,720
around

534
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,539
um why Biff is doing something like uh

535
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,179
Biff uh um change the code on the

536
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,700
DeLorean now you need to to decode it

537
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,260
and fix it

538
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,360
um I've also been a part of ctfs with

539
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,640
wider scope themes like retro video

540
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,940
games or the or Western CTF

541
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,500
um in each of these like the challenge

542
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,480
Creator can create a story around it the

543
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,240
hero which is the contestant and a bad

544
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,539
actor you know like nedry Biff or Bowser

545
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,840
or Outlaws and it and it really helps

546
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,059
like the challenge writers determine a

547
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,740
goal

548
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,039
uh so some CTF framework considerations

549
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,320
all right so we've we've picked a theme

550
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,179
we have

551
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,100
um you know we've we've scoped out kind

552
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,320
of what categories we want we've decided

553
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,780
outcomes so how do we how do we pick a

554
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,120
framework well before picking a

555
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,100
framework uh you need to figure out what

556
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,900
kind of challenges you're deploying do

557
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,480
you have user isolated challenges a user

558
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,659
isolated challenge would be if I gave

559
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:15,179
somebody access to a box I wouldn't want

560
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,400
that contestant to be able to affect

561
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,679
everyone else you know I wouldn't want

562
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,659
somebody to the this gentleman right

563
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,100
here I wouldn't want him to go be able

564
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,080
to change the flag so nobody else could

565
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,940
get the flag so I might give everybody

566
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,720
their own container and and that way you

567
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
know nobody would be able to

568
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
um affect every other person

569
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,200
uh do you plan on having coding

570
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,360
challenges this is another popular way

571
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,760
that you can another proper popular way

572
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,919
that you can test people's knowledge is

573
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,080
you can give them broken code and then

574
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,700
you can run

575
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,700
um a test case against that code and if

576
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,360
it fails then they haven't solved it so

577
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,740
uh

578
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,000
you know if you want something like that

579
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,860
you need a a framework that can support

580
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,360
that mechanism

581
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,059
and how do you plan on scoring are you

582
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,440
going to have Dynamic scoring more

583
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,120
people solve a challenge is the point

584
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,559
value going to go down

585
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,299
what about the first person to solve the

586
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,380
challenge

587
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,480
and uh what needs do you anticipate

588
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,580
during the competition will you need to

589
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,500
edit a challenge mid-event

590
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,419
do you need to drop hints is the admin

591
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,480
panel working so these are things that

592
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,880
you need to consider but an important

593
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,120
note is it might run in parallel with

594
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,760
actually writing the challenges because

595
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,960
you know without having the challenges

596
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,820
it's hard to Define kind of what you

597
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,600
need

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,520
so let's talk about

599
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,679
options

600
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,220
um here's three options uh ctfd it's the

601
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,799
most popular CTF framework right now

602
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,960
it's open source and it requires a fair

603
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,820
amount of configuration but

604
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,620
it now supports user isolation

605
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,720
challenges it didn't a year ago now it

606
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
does uh and it it also supports uh

607
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,520
coding so if you have a code challenge

608
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,340
that this will this will check that

609
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,760
um kctf this is uh this is quite recent

610
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,039
actually Google really Google just

611
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,900
released this it's a kubernetes based

612
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,419
platform that will dynamically spin up a

613
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,820
new container every time a user hits an

614
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,740
instance so

615
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,960
um this is a user way to do that user

616
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,520
isolation

617
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,340
um it's it's run com it's run in the

618
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,559
command line or on gcp but um right now

619
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,480
there's not a way to integrate it into a

620
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,299
cohesive front end which I think is like

621
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,700
the next step it's I would consider it

622
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,919
very beta project right now

623
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,900
um technically you could use it as your

624
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,419
like challenge server and then you could

625
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,220
use a front end and you could just point

626
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,460
to the URLs that you're generating but

627
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,320
if you want like an all-in-one that

628
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,580
doesn't do it yet

629
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,520
and then uh you know selfishly uh red

630
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,039
CTF it's open source scalable with user

631
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,620
isolated challenge capabilities uh I

632
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,360
will tell you documentation is a little

633
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,419
lacking so that's that's not my strong

634
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,000
suit but uh I've used it for the last

635
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,520
three years at kernel Khan and uh it's

636
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,159
worked for uh 200 participants plus

637
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,960
participants each time

638
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,580
um we have user isolated challenge

639
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,000
capabilities uh we also dynamically spin

640
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,700
up containers based on uh total number

641
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,120
of entries and so we

642
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
um hand people containers instantly the

643
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,440
second they hit a but you know they hit

644
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,179
get me a container it gets handed to

645
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,159
them and then we're spinning one up in

646
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,240
the background

647
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,580
those are these are some options right

648
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,679
ctfd is probably out of the box the

649
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,220
easiest one

650
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,799
uh writing the challenges uh this is the

651
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,600
most important part of creating a CTF

652
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,640
because your primary goal is education

653
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,220
right there's you repeat that with me

654
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,980
primary goal is education and a

655
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,720
challenge writer they can fall into

656
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,240
several traps which make for a terrible

657
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
experience with participants and I'm

658
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,380
going to talk through those traps real

659
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,559
quick

660
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,919
trap one

661
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,799
I'm so smart the challenge ends up being

662
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,320
crazy difficult for the competitors and

663
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,779
is not a real life situation

664
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,120
um an example of that would be if you

665
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,799
installed a vulnerable service and then

666
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,340
you custom patched it you you patched um

667
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,320
you know only one piece of that service

668
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,840
that would never happen in real life if

669
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,779
if if there was a vulnerable service and

670
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,179
you knew about it you would just do the

671
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,340
advisory that was produced by the vendor

672
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,260
you would patch it that way you wouldn't

673
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,960
custom patched one little feature of it

674
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,700
and you know intentionally trying to

675
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,580
make it more difficult so that's a trap

676
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,159
right you don't you don't want to make

677
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,720
something where you think that this this

678
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,580
is going to be so so smart and but

679
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,320
nobody solves it zero people solve it

680
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,940
they hate it

681
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,840
um

682
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,140
trap number two the the competitor is

683
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,960
confused right this challenge ends up

684
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,900
being guesswork I've seen a lot of these

685
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,840
and I um usually when I'm soliciting

686
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,700
challenges this is the one that I have

687
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,520
to often go back to challenge creators

688
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,740
and talk to them about because a lot of

689
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,900
times people will put together

690
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,840
like guesswork challenges one of them

691
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,440
was you get you saw the latitude and you

692
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,380
solve a longitude and then how to get

693
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,840
the flag is you go put that in Google

694
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,520
map and then you look around the street

695
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,580
view and you find a sign with a town

696
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,799
name on it and you take that that sign

697
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
and you you do an md5 hash and that's

698
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,880
the flag

699
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,480
but it's like yeah how how would anyone

700
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,980
know how to do that you just gave him a

701
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,140
longitude and latitude and then nothing

702
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,260
you know like that's impossible

703
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,340
so

704
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,179
uh or or uh there was one character uh

705
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,100
bless his heart real real good guy but

706
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,500
he made a reverse engineering challenge

707
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,039
that um had lots of little modules

708
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,320
everywhere and when you put it into a

709
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,000
particular December

710
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
and then you scrolled out enough

711
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,520
it it was made into a meme

712
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,940
that had a uh that had a flag Well turns

713
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,620
out he didn't test it in any other

714
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,659
decemblers and only worked in a single

715
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,820
one and it only worked if you had a big

716
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,900
enough screen

717
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,799
and so it was impossible to use for any

718
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,220
other person and you know that you you

719
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,460
run into these these uh traps here and

720
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,620
it just ends up being a nightmare and

721
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,120
the last trap

722
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,400
the challenge is too messy

723
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,440
um this is similar to the confusing path

724
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,380
one but uh it doesn't have a single path

725
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,620
or it doesn't cover the intended lesson

726
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,059
um and here's an example of something

727
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,820
like that you build out a cryptography

728
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,860
challenge that

729
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,080
you get a string and you have to do

730
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,380
base64 okay you get another string and

731
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,980
then you do you know rot 13 okay you get

732
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,659
another string and then you do this and

733
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:58,980
then you do that and then this and then

734
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,659
that and this and that and you're at

735
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,240
eight levels deep before you find the

736
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
the flag that makes no sense like

737
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,539
there's it's way messy a uh nobody

738
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,700
encrypts anything like that you know

739
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,559
nobody half the stuff that they were

740
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,559
using didn't even like isn't a real

741
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
cryptography method it just happened to

742
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
be in cyber Chef right and then in cyber

743
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,039
Chef is a if you're not familiar with it

744
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,039
it's a way where you can take an input

745
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,740
and you can add recipes to it until it

746
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,299
results in something

747
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,039
this is just a nightmare though because

748
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,679
these recipes could be in any order and

749
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:36,840
there's no clues as to what the next

750
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,899
string is so people fall into these

751
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,760
traps and I want to be I want to preface

752
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,559
everybody in the room with this you know

753
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,760
be careful when you're writing a

754
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,440
challenge that you don't fall into these

755
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,520
traps

756
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,980
what you want to do

757
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,679
is you want to write a good story okay

758
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,899
you want to stick to a theme

759
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,120
you would have a goal for your user

760
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,539
have a clear path right a win condition

761
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:02,880
you know have it make sense

762
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,580
and if it's challenging write a

763
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,200
potential hint like have that available

764
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
for your uh for the people who are

765
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,620
running the CTF

766
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,840
and then give good instructions in a

767
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,279
title

768
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,020
um this is something that can that can

769
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,419
be uh you know really important

770
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,279
um when I'm creating the challenge I

771
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,039
like to tell a story with the theme

772
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,320
am I trying to log into this website

773
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,940
as the admin

774
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,039
am I searching for a flag hidden inside

775
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,980
of a photo these types of questions can

776
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,860
be answered with a good story right and

777
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,799
the the last one

778
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,960
uh good instructions and title sometimes

779
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,480
you can sneak hints into titles or

780
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,340
descriptions of the challenges this is

781
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,799
one of my favorite things to do

782
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,679
um for example if a challenge might talk

783
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
about a user in their financial path

784
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,539
um that kind of might indicate that

785
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,240
there's a path traversal vulnerability

786
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,740
um so that that you know you can help

787
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,840
give hints to people

788
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,120
um where you're not Fielding a million

789
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,100
questions because you because they have

790
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,380
no idea where to go

791
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,659
um stories and hints are fun but the

792
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,820
most important thing to consider when

793
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,200
writing a challenge is to make sure it's

794
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,480
logical insane

795
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,480
um if it's you know crazy that you have

796
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,799
to go to a longitude and latitude on

797
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,960
Google Maps spin around until you find a

798
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,840
sign then md5 that that the name of that

799
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,620
town right that is illogical doesn't

800
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,960
make any sense

801
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,360
um so the best way to to do this is to

802
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,919
have another challenge Creator solve it

803
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,320
give it to somebody else and say

804
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,080
can you solve this you know and they can

805
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,279
give you honest feedback about your

806
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,059
challenge

807
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,740
and then one of the things that you

808
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,620
should also do is write and commit a

809
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,539
solution as well

810
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,200
do you have something

811
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,240
yeah

812
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,299
I you know what I have a I have a QA

813
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,720
slide

814
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,419
so uh make sure you write and commit a

815
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,640
solution as well um you should have you

816
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,260
should be able to tell somebody how to

817
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,120
solve your challenge if you can't tell

818
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,260
somebody how to solve your challenge

819
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,500
it's not good enough throw it away so

820
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,000
write out a solution

821
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,679
uh Pro tips

822
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,240
you know if you're if you're if you're

823
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,340
somebody who wants to do this bookmark

824
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,380
articles you read throughout the year as

825
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,600
potential inspiration for challenges I

826
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,480
have a I have a CTF going on at Amazon

827
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,380
right now that uses a math.random it's

828
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,720
predictable and there was an article

829
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,279
earlier this year and then a YouTube

830
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,440
video that I saw about how you can

831
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,940
predict node V8 math.random and I saved

832
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,559
that article all year and then I wrote a

833
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,200
CTF challenge for it and

834
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,179
um and my solution is based on the

835
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,340
YouTube videos

836
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,740
uh script that he wrote so I just I

837
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,620
grabbed his script and that that was it

838
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,279
uh if you can uh also if you can get

839
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,080
several people to create challenges

840
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,820
um diversity for a challenge set is

841
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,799
great you know you you are only

842
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,860
experiencing things through your lens so

843
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,080
if you are a particular really good web

844
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,140
guy you might not write the best uh

845
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,539
challenges for back-end folks or you

846
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:16,919
know you not might not write the best

847
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,080
exploit challenges

848
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,140
and then you could keep a a spreadsheet

849
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,360
or a repository to track challenges so

850
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,279
you know what topics are covered uh this

851
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,980
is a good one because it helps you kind

852
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,480
of you can make sure that you're

853
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,279
covering the different areas you want to

854
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:36,000
hit also you can have status right so

855
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
you know that this is earmarked but not

856
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,120
yet completed and person B is the person

857
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,500
working on it so you could say hey

858
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,299
person B when are you gonna have that

859
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,799
challenge done like CTF is fast

860
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,380
approaching and as we all are

861
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,120
procrastinators you know usually the

862
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,279
answer is like

863
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:56,340
uh next week it's coming so but it's a

864
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,899
good way to you know keep track of it

865
00:33:57,899 --> 00:33:59,159
and

866
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,980
um and then also to differentiate your

867
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,140
categories like oh networking only

868
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,179
has one challenge do we even need a

869
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,799
whole category for it

870
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,540
so

871
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,000
um and lastly yeah have each Creator

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,619
write and commit a solution to their

873
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,199
challenge this is important because

874
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,940
um when you're doing the actual CTF

875
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,040
those challenge creators are not going

876
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
to be available 24 hours a day so if I

877
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,839
have a solution and I'm hosting the

878
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,060
event I'm able to help people still

879
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,339
without having written the challenge

880
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,859
myself I might not have even solved it

881
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,020
myself but if I have a challenge I have

882
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,399
a solution in front of me I'm able to

883
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,199
like give hints

884
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,460
um you know tell people they're heading

885
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,080
in the right direction

886
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,399
Etc

887
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,239
foreign

888
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,418
so here's the QA slide void left but uh

889
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,159
this is the qia slide once the

890
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,960
challenges are written you need to test

891
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,520
each one ahead of the competition to

892
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,540
ensure that everything's working

893
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,099
properly

894
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,280
um also you can check scoring you know I

895
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,140
I have been in situations where I scored

896
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,300
something that 400 points and then

897
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,880
somebody says to me this isn't a 400

898
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,200
Point challenge

899
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,359
there's a public exploit now it's super

900
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,880
easy you just go here and download this

901
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,880
exploit and you can solve it so we

902
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,099
needed to refactor now it's a 200 Point

903
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,960
challenge

904
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,119
um and then stand up in an entire test

905
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,400
environment in like AWS or Azure or

906
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,980
something and uh that way you can

907
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,079
actually test finding and submitting

908
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,300
Flags because you want to make sure that

909
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,900
the submission part works as well

910
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,859
and um I've you know have Solutions and

911
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,140
hints ready uh so you can figure that

912
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,280
out as well

913
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,740
uh we're nearing the end here we're

914
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,240
going to talk a little bit about hosting

915
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,800
the event

916
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
uh this is the time you can pick up big

917
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,940
wins

918
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,339
um expect a lot of questions but this is

919
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,920
good okay this is a great way to get

920
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,420
FaceTime with the people that you don't

921
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,040
see that often

922
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,599
um make sure to answer questions with

923
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,420
empathy don't you know if somebody's

924
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,160
asking you what you consider a simple

925
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,359
question

926
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,180
tell them why and give them much you

927
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,339
know as much detail as you can provide

928
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,760
do not scoff and you know tell them to

929
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,500
try harder or go to Google or whatever

930
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
you know because that's that's not going

931
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,839
to be a way to ingratiate you to your

932
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:22,680
teammates

933
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,740
all right and

934
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,540
and so you want to answer with empathy

935
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,640
and these are people that you might only

936
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,200
see through Zoom or uh or slack and

937
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,140
they're um you know they might not be

938
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,480
around much but you're inviting them

939
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,280
invite them in

940
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,220
and answering questions also good way to

941
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,859
demonstrate competency uh which we

942
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,200
talked about earlier but now you're now

943
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,520
you're not only demonstrating your

944
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,280
competence compet competency but you're

945
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,380
also becoming a trusted resource for

946
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,420
them that person is going to know that

947
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,920
they can go to you and ask you a

948
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,480
question in the future which is

949
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,240
important because the amount of people

950
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,980
who don't ask questions who fail

951
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,380
silently that's the biggest sin in

952
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,839
software engineering you know you need

953
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,980
to ask for help if you don't know what

954
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,660
you're doing or you think that this is

955
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,880
potentially like a a service that needs

956
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
a Security review but it didn't get

957
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,880
marked for one or it didn't get

958
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,060
architected so that you should be able

959
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,980
to become a trusted resource for this

960
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,300
person

961
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,920
and um

962
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,140
you know answering questions is a large

963
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,020
part of your time but you also need to

964
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,099
make sure that the framework's always

965
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,220
running and verify any challenges need

966
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,619
extra hints I typically don't give out a

967
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,359
lot of hints until like the end of the

968
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,619
CTF

969
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,240
um if there's zero solves on a challenge

970
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,460
I'll give hints but uh generally

971
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,140
speaking your challenge is to be like a

972
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,520
bell curve

973
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,460
um or you know the easy challenges

974
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,480
lumped in the middle the harder

975
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,160
challenges on the outside less people

976
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,759
solve those

977
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,200
uh and then don't forget to make it fun

978
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,180
invite participants to hang out in the

979
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,859
operations room stock it with food

980
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:04,500
drinks and treats play music have a live

981
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,300
scoreboard make sure the participants

982
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,820
are enjoying themselves remember they're

983
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,500
volunteering their time to learn

984
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,380
Security in more detail with you and so

985
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,660
you want to make it as an accepting as

986
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,540
of of an environment as you can

987
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,160
and so

988
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,680
um that's why you know get a budget buy

989
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,740
stuff buy prizes you know get if you buy

990
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,599
prizes don't just give them to the first

991
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,060
place team buy prizes for the first

992
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,400
place team and then 10 more give them to

993
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,200
anybody who solved a challenge and say

994
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,940
like if you solve the challenge I'm

995
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,800
going to draw your name from a hat and

996
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,560
you get one of these prizes too

997
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,859
in conclusion creating a CTF can be a

998
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:46,079
lot of work and you might ask is this

999
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,180
worth it right I spent an hour

1000
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,500
describing all the different things that

1001
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,900
you need to do but let me ask these

1002
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,060
questions okay are people engaged with

1003
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,359
this gamified security training yes

1004
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,940
is my team able to demonstrate its

1005
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,820
expertise yes it's my team getting to

1006
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,200
know the engineering team that we work

1007
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,200
closely with yes are the participants

1008
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,079
having fun yes and if you can answer yes

1009
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,680
to all these questions it's worth it

1010
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,680
thank you everybody for your time uh and

1011
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,790
I'm happy to take any questions

1012
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:26,590
[Applause]

1013
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
no no no

1014
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,660
I I stick in higher fees debating my

1015
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,180
existence when I'm doing the CTF that's

1016
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,040
the my least favorite category to be

1017
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,540
honest

1018
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,060
yeah

1019
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,520
yeah so um I know this talk was about

1020
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,260
CTF but have you involved or have uh you

1021
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,540
ever seen anybody else try to evolve the

1022
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,000
is the response team to kind of do like

1023
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,700
a tabletop based off of his ETFs yeah

1024
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,680
actually I have um I worked at an

1025
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,200
insurance company in the uh the security

1026
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,079
operations team was they're kind of my

1027
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,800
my testers and we would go through

1028
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
um and they would help test the

1029
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,740
framework and then we would talk about

1030
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,839
like how they would react and they would

1031
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,119
build out drafts of like how they would

1032
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,740
react to certain situations and build

1033
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,020
out their own run books for it I had one

1034
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,420
particular case where I was moving all

1035
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,880
of my challenges from one box to another

1036
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,980
box and I had committed it accidentally

1037
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,079
to a public repo and one of the security

1038
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,060
operations people found it and all of a

1039
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,619
sudden he had a hundred percent solves

1040
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,560
and it was super embarrassing

1041
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,440
um but uh he won I gave him the I gave

1042
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,079
him the I think I I had a budget so I

1043
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,660
was giving the testers the top top three

1044
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,760
prizes some cash and uh he won so but

1045
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,560
yeah it's a great question involving

1046
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,300
this the secops team is a great way to

1047
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,020
like

1048
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,119
get them to be involved and run books

1049
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,579
and help you you know design things that

1050
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,720
are real world scenarios

1051
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,880
yeah uh back there and then up here uh

1052
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,480
so in practice CCS can can take like

1053
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,760
four hours to four days depending on the

1054
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,060
format

1055
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,920
yeah it's a great question uh so every

1056
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,900
time I've done it I've done it at

1057
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,420
um workplaces that have uh that have

1058
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,099
people all over the world so what I

1059
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,500
typically do is I leave it open for 24

1060
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,079
hours and then I break my team up into

1061
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,780
eight hour shifts and so I always take

1062
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,280
the worst shift

1063
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,920
um you know like the the more early

1064
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,660
morning type of shift kind of thing but

1065
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,700
then we have full coverage across all 24

1066
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,040
hours and it's not biased against any

1067
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,339
time zone because it's just available

1068
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,720
um usually when I'm doing that I also

1069
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,359
just like never release hints because if

1070
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,940
you're releasing hints uh you might be

1071
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,180
doing it when America is sleeping or you

1072
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,640
know Israel is sleeping and that's not

1073
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,880
fair so if I'm doing like a 24-hour type

1074
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,619
of event that's that's what I do uh

1075
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,420
sometimes we'll do things where um at

1076
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,460
Amazon right now our CTF has been open

1077
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,440
all week so people can work at it at

1078
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,760
their Leisure

1079
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,260
um and and they have they have the

1080
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,880
entire week and so by the end of the

1081
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,640
week yesterday somebody solved the

1082
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,220
entire challenge board so

1083
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,260
um it was Thursday and and now you have

1084
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,119
more people like finishing and

1085
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,260
everything

1086
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,359
um that's that format is kind of like up

1087
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,859
to your discretion right if you can get

1088
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,300
time off for these people who are

1089
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,460
participating like away from their jobs

1090
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,859
or make it part of like a fun day for

1091
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:29,700
them

1092
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,359
then do that I highly recommend like get

1093
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,640
them time to work on it um at Amazon

1094
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,160
this was like in your free time type of

1095
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,839
thing right now so they weren't giving

1096
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,000
people time off to specifically work on

1097
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,560
it so that's why it was a full week

1098
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,560
uh that's a good question um I think

1099
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,500
that most of the challenges are um

1100
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,119
I think that a lot of that depends on

1101
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,740
like how many hard challenges you have

1102
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,400
uh and so I think minimum I try to hit

1103
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,800
about 20.

1104
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,460
um but uh uh I've seen you know 30 or 40

1105
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,619
before in this in a situation like that

1106
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,839
most the time when you're doing 30 or 40

1107
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,119
it's because you have a lot of easy

1108
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:13,920
challenges you're you're working with a

1109
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,599
lot of intro level people so you're

1110
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,579
hiding Flags inside of source code and

1111
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,339
websites so if they click f11 they'll

1112
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,720
get a flag that kind of thing

1113
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,400
yeah so I was going to ask how do you um

1114
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,520
or companies work that how do you

1115
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,880
incentivize or compel participation uh

1116
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,440
you know from non-security folks

1117
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,319
but like I mean have you found the

1118
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,440
strategies for really getting

1119
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,160
non-security focused people to

1120
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,859
participate yeah one of the uh one of

1121
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:49,140
the better strategies that I had with

1122
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,220
that was

1123
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,680
um when we did I worked at a company

1124
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,359
called contrast security we had an

1125
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,400
offsite in San Diego and the whole

1126
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,859
company came out there and we had uh the

1127
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,160
CTF available all week so every person

1128
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,200
who was working on it they had their

1129
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,940
laptops open and people were seeing it

1130
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,160
and that just made them want to get

1131
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,980
involved and so I had HR I had ux people

1132
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,960
come up to me and ask me like hey what

1133
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,940
are they doing and so I'd introduce them

1134
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,339
to the concept of ctfs and I'd talk to

1135
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:19,440
them about it I don't think that you can

1136
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,660
make it mandatory I think that needs to

1137
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,339
be I think that it needs to be something

1138
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,380
that somebody you know becomes

1139
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,619
interested in and and so that you know

1140
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:31,220
that helped

1141
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,020
hell yeah

1142
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,760
um and more and more people

1143
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,400
um ended up like participating over time

1144
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,200
and it was shocking a number of uh sales

1145
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,700
Engineers

1146
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,339
um customer success people and kind of

1147
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:06,900
ended up stealing one of our uh our

1148
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,099
people over to be the first called

1149
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:08,940
security

1150
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,720
um

1151
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,400
um the first Cloud security engineering

1152
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,319
uh a lot of his curiosity came from

1153
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,260
getting involved in that cpf so thanks

1154
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,960
for the yeah it was one of the coolest

1155
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,460
things I've ever watched just in terms

1156
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,980
of human actors yeah

1157
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,260
so I guess framing this more from the

1158
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,060
competition standpoint since you run

1159
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,700
competition ctfs what are your thoughts

1160
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,040
on awarding points for things that maybe

1161
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,800
were not tracks challenges so I discover

1162
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,079
a vulnerability which is accounted for

1163
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,680
yeah yeah uh I try to cover all of that

1164
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,060
in the instructions I say if you

1165
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,380
discover a vulnerability in the system

1166
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,400
let us know it's worth up to X points

1167
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,960
um and and I try to cover that kind of

1168
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,380
like in engine you know in general

1169
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,319
um I was running a CTF uh last year

1170
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,200
where I left the room to introduce a

1171
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,200
speaker and um when I came back somebody

1172
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,079
had created a new challenge uh and

1173
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,819
awarded somebody points because somebody

1174
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,160
came up and asked them for a flag so

1175
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,079
they made up a flag and gave it to them

1176
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,760
and they're like yeah this is no a new

1177
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,380
flag like you just have to ask us for

1178
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,140
one and and that that person who asked

1179
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,000
for one was the only one who solved it

1180
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,619
the whole event nobody else that walked

1181
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,599
up to the Creator is asking for it so I

1182
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,180
think like if it it's not within your

1183
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,040
scope I think it's I think you got to

1184
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,400
stay away from it um it it can bring up

1185
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,800
tons of arguments we had a lock picking

1186
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,859
Village say um hey we want to put these

1187
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,260
locks up for people to go pack and and

1188
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,660
participate and we said great idea let's

1189
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,540
do it and they said this is like a 100

1190
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,000
level one this is a 300 level one and

1191
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,520
this is a 500 Point level one

1192
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,380
and we said great we'll put these

1193
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,300
challenges up and we did it really

1194
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,060
randomly at the time but it created so

1195
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,980
much grief because the lock picking

1196
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,560
Village then participated in the CTF and

1197
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,819
they were the only ones to solve all

1198
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:03,060
three of the lock picks so I kind of

1199
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,500
locked down the CTF and the points and I

1200
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,720
include things like you know like if you

1201
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,579
solve if you crack our framework to

1202
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,319
please tell us especially because I'm

1203
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,720
usually running my own framework

1204
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,720
um and uh but you know anything else I

1205
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,579
say I'm not including it during the

1206
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,200
during the event people bring up things

1207
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,879
I say nope sorry

1208
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,720
CTF vendor has a lot of bonus challenges

1209
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,460
and you can spend like weeks trying to

1210
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,280
solve the bonus challenges and

1211
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,359
undocumented you never know when to end

1212
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,260
it's super frustrating yeah yeah I agree

1213
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,720
so if somebody who um

1214
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,060
you've qualified to create one when I

1215
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,079
have somebody come to me security

1216
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,180
periods I usually send them an abandoned

1217
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,400
board games if they're uh if they're

1218
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,020
thinking about State links or something

1219
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,359
like that am I am I doing them a service

1220
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,400
or this service can I can I continue to

1221
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,960
use those things even though yeah

1222
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,480
absolutely there's also Pico CTF is this

1223
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,540
a really beginner friendly open CTF

1224
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,339
um hack the box which is that that's

1225
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:10,020
more of the full scope all the way to

1226
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,540
privilege escalation

1227
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,400
um there's um

1228
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,180
uh what's the EU one do you know

1229
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,480
try try hack me is the one yeah uh but

1230
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,500
there's there's a number of different

1231
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,359
places I should have had a resources

1232
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,760
slide that would have been good

1233
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,339
folks is checking out CTF time.org and

1234
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,200
that'll show you like number one a list

1235
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,599
in the schedule of upcoming ctfs but

1236
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,760
they also have right so you can learn so

1237
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,560
much from reading the write-ups of other

1238
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,720
challenges yeah that's a great that's a

1239
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,339
great call out you couldn't build a team

1240
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:44,520
on ctftime.org too and you can compete I

1241
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,619
had a team that cracked uh Global 100

1242
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,839
top 100 one year that was really cool

1243
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,780
but um you go and you have to you have

1244
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,660
to be very active to do that and they

1245
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,579
have upcoming ctfs that you can track

1246
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:58,740
and join in and be a part of it's it's

1247
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,680
really cool place

1248
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,020
what's a typical cost for a company to

1249
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,359
run a cpf especially if you're building

1250
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,280
on your own I mean yeah we've done it

1251
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,319
before and yeah we basically just say

1252
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,240
yeah whatever you guys need but for

1253
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,599
somebody else yeah great great question

1254
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:16,920
so it takes time right it takes some of

1255
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,020
your time and you need to like you need

1256
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,760
to say I'm going to do this as part of

1257
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,280
my security awareness training and so

1258
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,619
I'm spending additional time more than I

1259
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,119
would do because this is going to

1260
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,160
benefit us in the long run and then I

1261
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,260
need a prize budget or I have food and

1262
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,500
snacks budget and so generally like that

1263
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,180
a lot of that depends on how long you

1264
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,339
want to scope the competition

1265
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,220
um and how many participants you can you

1266
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,680
can you know reasonably have

1267
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,579
um in in some cases like Amazon's case

1268
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,319
they have you know thousands of

1269
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,819
participants uh and so you know do we we

1270
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:55,680
can't really buy everybody a t-shirt at

1271
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,480
that level you know but like if you have

1272
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,700
200 participants maybe everyone could

1273
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,380
get a t-shirt or

1274
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,660
um swag and you know you could have food

1275
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,079
and stuff so I think it depends but

1276
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,020
um I've done it for less than five

1277
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,260
um I've done it for less than eight

1278
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,700
uh those are the those are the two where

1279
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,520
I got in a defined budget that was that

1280
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
for infrastructure as well I mean I know

1281
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,560
that's kind of you know the prices yeah

1282
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,940
so um

1283
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,339
the infrastructure is super cheap I mean

1284
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,020
that's um

1285
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,619
that's uh less than ninety dollars uh

1286
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:33,480
for one weekend

1287
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,460
um it's it's super cheap and really easy

1288
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,200
to run and spin up everything's

1289
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,819
containerized you put it up in the ec2

1290
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:43,020
box and it runs for a week or two uh and

1291
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,819
that's you know less than a hundred

1292
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:46,680
dollars

1293
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,960
so earlier you said that Amazon has been

1294
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,280
reported by t-shirts for a thousand

1295
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,420
people should I be thinking about moving

1296
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,720
average

1297
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
yeah we have a leadership principle and

1298
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,480
it's frugality so my hotel room

1299
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,140
