1
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,080
foreign

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,850
[Music]

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,489
[Music]

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
[Music]

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,960
[Music]

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,879
all right so this is kind of maybe like

7
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,100
a continuation from last year I know a

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
lot of people have seen me talking about

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,180
blockchain a lot recently uh it's

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,280
something I'm very passionate about yeah

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,479
it sounds good

12
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,400
and uh some I'm very passionate about

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
and I think it's the future of a lot of

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,820
different things

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,340
um and what I what I do is I'm going to

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,500
take a very practical approach on this

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm going to talk about blockchain a

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,619
little bit

19
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,240
and I'm also going to talk about some of

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,979
the use cases that I think are the

21
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,520
future uh future of this thing and I'm

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,020
going to go through some code and show

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,960
y'all how uh I'm going to show you a

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,939
little bit of JavaScript code uh

25
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,020
JavaScript is kind of like the

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,360
predominant language in blockchain and

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,220
ethereum development and all that stuff

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,500
on the front end and I'm going to show

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,200
some solidity which is solidity is is

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,420
the language uh kind of like the

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,540
official language for ethereum

32
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,460
so I'm gonna go through this and

33
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
hopefully we have some fun hopefully you

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,579
learned a thing or two hopefully I

35
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,540
learned something because I'm pretty

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
sure I'm going to get good feedback from

37
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,520
y'all

38
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,119
all right cool so next slide Okay cool

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,640
so this is on this is actually on the on

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,160
the talk uh description

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,199
um I think that I'm very passionate

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,280
about thinking cyber security

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,599
professionals that need to do this

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,700
because all the companies that we work

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,860
for are eventually going to be using

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,599
blockchain technology you're probably

47
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,980
going to be taking some kind of crypto

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,280
payments right now uh predominantly uh

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
ethereum uh based uh tokens are the

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
predominant form of uh transfer there's

51
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
this coin this coin called usdc which is

52
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,900
used for a lot of different transactions

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,900
across the world ethereum is uh the

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,800
number two crypto behind a Bitcoin uh

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,019
but from from a from a usage from a

56
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,420
practical user standpoint the ethereum

57
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,400
uh blockchain is kind of like where it's

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,040
at and there's a lot of side chains uh

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,819
so this talk is going to cover uh what

60
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,220
they call a ethereum virtual machine ebm

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,780
environments in terms of several

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,940
blockchains that have our our evm

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,200
environments

64
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,760
all right so we're going to talk about

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,260
we're gonna I'm gonna talk about smart

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,140
contracts uh I'm gonna talk about

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,780
developing smart contract stuff again a

68
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,519
little bit of code I'm going to talk

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,980
about web 3 web 3 is a it's kind of a

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,659
marketing term used for all this stuff

71
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,379
uh it's been used relation to nfts nfts

72
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,900
were booming last year not nfts kind of

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,360
are in the in the dumpster the dumpster

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
fire

75
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
um but this whole Space is moving super

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,599
fast and I think the core technology is

77
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,180
what I'm focusing on here and and the

78
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,379
core technology is going to be around

79
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,180
for a long time and I think it's going

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,220
to change the way we do stuff in our

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,620
regular security labs

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,420
all right cool we want to explore common

83
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,400
issues there's three issues that I'm

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,159
gonna cover at the end and I'm going to

85
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,379
give you resources to go find more

86
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,120
so how many people here have developed a

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,900
smart contract before

88
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,360
cool it's a couple of people sweet

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,159
you're over there doing a smart contract

90
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,720
right now that's fine

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,340
okay fantastic

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,840
all right cool so ethereum is what we're

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,819
talking about here but what we're

94
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,560
talking about mostly is the ethereum

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
virtual machine uh so ethereum virtual

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,540
machine what that means is that all

97
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,579
these ethereum uh what some people call

98
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,680
them miners or whatever some people call

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,779
them violators what those what's what

100
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,220
many of those things are doing is

101
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,740
they're they're running this code that

102
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,840
we're running in solidity uh it's

103
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,060
compiled and they're running this code

104
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,580
on on their Miners and the miners get

105
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,860
paid for for uh running the transactions

106
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,160
uh the the whole the big technology

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
names people call it a blockchain but

108
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
the real name is distributed Ledger

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,139
technology I think the the is the more

110
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,880
the correct terms you use the more

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,860
information you find because when I

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,419
first start out I've been I've been

113
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,860
heavy into this strike like the last

114
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,900
year and this is totally on the side not

115
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,540
not a part of my my day job I do develop

116
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,580
a lot of apps for my day job but at

117
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,000
night I like to play with blockchain

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so ethereum evm is what we're talking

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
about ethereum virtual machine ethereum

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,680
virtual machine essentially means any

121
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,320
node that runs this code for us

122
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,759
that make sense

123
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,199
all right cool

124
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,320
so so why again there's tons of

125
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,180
applications that I think that that uh

126
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,680
blockchain has done so so far we we have

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,860
coins and people speculating on coins uh

128
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,780
there's been nfts that blew up like I

129
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,520
said last year and I think that

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,500
sometimes there's there's unintended

131
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,740
consequences or unintended benefits even

132
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,080
when you talk about blockchain and I

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
think that I'm gonna I'm gonna talk

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,020
about some I think it's going to change

135
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,240
a couple of things like authentication I

136
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,259
think it's going to change a lot of

137
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,639
different things and I'll show you on a

138
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,860
little bit why this is

139
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,620
so while it's first thing uh how many of

140
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,520
y'all have a a wallet uh crypto wallet

141
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,220
okay so that that's a lot of people how

142
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,720
many people have done transactions on

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,580
ethereum blockchain

144
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,020
a couple people how many people done

145
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,699
Bitcoin

146
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,139
all right cool so we got some crypto

147
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,479
heads in here so what an externally on

148
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,720
the count is is it's a public private

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,000
key pair essentially and what that

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
allows you to do is to make transactions

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,900
on the blockchain so a wallet is an

152
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,120
externally owned account now the cool

153
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,740
thing about ethereum that a lot of

154
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
people don't know there's no

155
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,340
transactions that run unless there's

156
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,340
unless there's a an externally owned

157
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,919
wallet paying what they call a gas fee

158
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,479
and a lot of people complain about

159
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,600
guesses but what gas fees do is it

160
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,639
prevents denial of service attacks on a

161
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,600
blockchain

162
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,100
because you can only have so much

163
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,440
ethereum in your wallet and you would

164
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
have to spend they basically have gas

165
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,880
caps on how much operations that a

166
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,979
ethereum virtual machine could do other

167
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,419
than that somebody would have some kind

168
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,580
of stupid program that they ran and it

169
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
would run out forever and it would lock

170
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,699
up the entire blockchain eventually you

171
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,039
could dedos the blockchain by creating

172
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,020
some crappy program that does infinite

173
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,060
Loop or something stupid like that so

174
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,280
there's a gas thing so after every time

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,380
something runs an operation so every

176
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,479
time it adds subtracts change the

177
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,819
variable there's a gas fee associated

178
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,740
with that and there's a gas cap

179
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,319
eventually if you run a gas the program

180
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,759
stops

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,199
so a lot of people can write bad

182
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,240
programs but what's cool about it is

183
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,699
that this this ethereum virtual machine

184
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,319
is kind of like a lot of people there's

185
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,840
there's actually a protocol called ICP

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
which stands for internet computer

187
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,160
protocol that's an actual that's a

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
different blockchain but the idea of

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,539
having an internet computer is

190
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,919
blockchain

191
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,199
uh of course many of y'all know that the

192
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
people came up the the some of the

193
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,419
hardcore purists on blockchain what they

194
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,880
they want to eliminate the banks and so

195
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,740
what the distributed lesla does it has

196
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,539
all these nodes all over the place and

197
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,160
they're keeping the lead they're keeping

198
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,080
it instead of a bank a central bank

199
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,720
keeping it so it's distributed so we can

200
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,419
Tran do Financial transactions but

201
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,819
what's cool Bitcoin did that and and

202
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,220
totally crushed it there's a couple more

203
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,560
for Bitcoin but then ethereum came out

204
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,360
with this thing that you can actually

205
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,580
run code and you can run a little bit of

206
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,039
code on on related to bitcoin scripting

207
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,460
but ethereum is really something that

208
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,680
you can code on and it's really it's

209
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,479
really awesome and I'll show y'all how

210
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,400
this does but the first thing is an

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
externally owned account

212
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,419
pays the gas fees and can initiate

213
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,580
transactions so that's why a wallet's

214
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,399
important it's a public and private key

215
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,260
and just like in cryptography and

216
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,240
traditional cryptography the private key

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,979
is held private

218
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,320
and what you can do is sign transactions

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,080
and prove that you own the account prove

220
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,700
that you own The Ether and all that

221
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
stuff so this is actually pretty cool

222
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,260
funny enough my background is I was in

223
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,399
the U.S Navy

224
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,880
uh I joined in 1993. I think I'm getting

225
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,800
old as a mug uh

226
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,440
but I did cryptography in the Navy

227
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
and and one of the biggest breakthroughs

228
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,959
in cryptography was public private key

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,540
and cryptography uh people for familiar

230
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,920
with Diffie Hellman and all those

231
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,760
different oh oh the the ogs of the space

232
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,620
this is pretty cool because when I first

233
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
heard of blockchain I heard people

234
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
talking about cryptocurrency I did not

235
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,300
understand it it was actually related to

236
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,620
something I've been doing since I was 18

237
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,000
years old

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,740
and I was like God dang I can't believe

239
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,420
I've been in this space for all these

240
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,399
years I actually have patented I have a

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,100
crypto patent for uh for communications

242
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,680
as well so I'm a patented cryptographer

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
but I totally ignored

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,940
totally ignored the crypto space

245
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,160
cryptocurrency space until last year

246
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
it's the craziest thing I didn't realize

247
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
that there was that applicable knowledge

248
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,140
that I already had but then I picked it

249
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,459
up I was like God dang I've been doing

250
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,399
this since I was 18 years old

251
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,160
all right so how do wallets work I've

252
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,660
talked about the public key the private

253
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,940
key private Keys use their uh uh to sign

254
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,800
transactions just like regular old

255
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,959
crypto this is stuff we've been doing in

256
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,580
the security space for a while we've

257
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,680
been talking about pki signing stuff

258
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,260
this is the same exact stuff it's it

259
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,240
blew my mind I was I was like wow this

260
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
is we've been doing this for years

261
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
there was a couple different things

262
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
there's there's this thing called a hot

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,279
wallet and a cold wallet right

264
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,320
a hot wallet is something that resides

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,060
in your browser and the difference and

266
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
and it resides in your browser that

267
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,320
means your browser is caching the

268
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
private key

269
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
so in your in your Google storage uh

270
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,519
thing in your Chrome or whatever browser

271
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
you like it's actually saving this

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,300
private key inside the the browser that

273
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,980
means if your machine is compromised and

274
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,560
they can access that then they can they

275
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
can get your private key inside

276
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,220
transactions on your behalf

277
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,980
and that's why that's a hotkey it's hot

278
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,680
it's live the key is is accessible from

279
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,920
anywhere and then there's a co-wallet uh

280
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,959
the cold wallet what happens with that

281
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
is actually brought one and brought one

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
if you want to see one uh it's a many

283
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,399
times they look like a little USB device

284
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,100
the difference between a that is that

285
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,740
your computer can't access quote unquote

286
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,500
can't access uh and this is this is

287
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,060
you'll see a lot of challenges on

288
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,320
hacking wallets

289
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,200
because you have to jump from the

290
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,680
machine to the USB type devices and

291
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,060
there's a couple of different USB

292
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,860
devices the reason it's called a cold

293
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,959
wallet is that your machine typically

294
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,060
does not have access to the private key

295
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,880
on it so you can sign transactions with

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
this USB device it's kind of like a UB

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,880
key or something like that that we've

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,220
been using for years as well that's what

299
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,740
a that's what a cold water does and it's

300
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,300
highly recommended if you have a lot of

301
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,360
crypto assets that you use a cold wallet

302
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,980
um you can take that cold wallet and you

303
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,360
can plug it into any machine you want

304
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,300
and and technically uh they're hardened

305
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,060
against uh extracting that private key

306
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,760
that's why it's important

307
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
metamask is the most popular hot wallet

308
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,860
uh how many people use metamask

309
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,980
some people yeah so metamask is the the

310
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,200
is the the dominant player because they

311
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,060
have ties to the actual ethereum core

312
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,060
team so there's a recurring theme these

313
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,680
guys are smart by the way this is the

314
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,920
guy that uh that got it created his name

315
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,959
is vitalik buttering he's super smart

316
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,480
and he has a whole core team and these

317
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,959
guys are eating they got they own open C

318
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,880
they own they created metamask they

319
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,500
doing they making so much money off of

320
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,820
there and it's ridiculous and I think

321
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,839
vitalik's a billionaire

322
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,640
all right so what we need to know from a

323
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,160
from an abstract perspective right

324
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,980
abstract there's two Proto these two two

325
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,860
main libraries and so web three web

326
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,019
three is is there's a there's a thing

327
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,860
called web3js right and web3js is pretty

328
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,139
interesting because it actually there's

329
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,180
a web 3GS for multiple

330
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,120
um for multiple blockchains right

331
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,820
uh ethers is pretty cool that's that's

332
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,740
my favorite library that I I choose to

333
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,500
interact with I use ethers ethers allows

334
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,320
you to to use JavaScript to communicate

335
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,779
to um the blockchain

336
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,480
now you cannot I'll have a slide that

337
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,060
says this this is kind of cool too you

338
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,860
cannot communicate directly from your

339
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,200
machine to the blockchain

340
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,720
you have to use an RPC provider to do

341
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,620
that

342
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,139
and what metamask does is it gives you a

343
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,040
RPC provider uh for you now metamask is

344
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,220
it's this website called inferior infur

345
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,360
a

346
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,779
inferior is the like predominant uh RPC

347
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,660
proxy so to interact with blockchain you

348
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,880
either have to have a note yourself a

349
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,579
node I think it costs over 30 ethereum

350
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,519
to do and that's a lot of money huh 32

351
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,220
something like that you need to have 32

352
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,839
ethereum to actually be on the

353
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,940
blockchain and you have to lock it up

354
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,500
and stake it

355
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
because what happens is if you do any

356
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,760
Shenanigans they'll take that 32 it's a

357
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,579
punishment so you pay for a node and if

358
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,740
you if you do anything crazy uh what

359
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,240
they call front running transactions

360
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,680
where you're trying to profit you're

361
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
trying to do all kind of shady stuff

362
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,579
they will take all your ether and you

363
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,620
and your node will be kicked off the the

364
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,600
blockchain

365
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,160
so these guys have thought about a lot

366
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,420
of security and a lot of different

367
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,060
things uh and the reason why I'm saying

368
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,440
that is because most of the time you're

369
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
dealing if you're dealing with metamask

370
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,899
or something like that you're actually

371
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,420
communicating to RPC proxy the

372
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,579
interferer owns and inferior is doing

373
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,139
the blockchain transaction on your

374
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,820
behalf

375
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,220
but you're signing it with your private

376
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,000
key

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,740
right

378
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,500
y'all got that cool so the way to

379
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,120
communicate to the blockchain is you're

380
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,699
using web 3 you're using a private key

381
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:44,100
in your in your uh in your externally on

382
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,260
account your metamask or your hot wallet

383
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,180
and what you're doing there is you're

384
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,519
interacting with a proxy somewhere and

385
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,440
the metamask actually uses inferior too

386
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,920
by the way we found this out because uh

387
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,079
there was like a trade sanction some

388
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
kind of new rule FTC regulation that

389
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,720
actually blocked Russia and Iran and all

390
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,540
that stuff and then for everybody there

391
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,100
was trying to transact from over those

392
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,139
countries got blocked overnight

393
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,000
and everybody's had their crypto locked

394
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,380
up it was kind of crazy everybody's

395
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,800
panicking

396
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,399
all right cool

397
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,459
so basically this is basic con oh this

398
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,800
is a actually I kind of redesigned my

399
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,660
slides at the last Point hopefully y'all

400
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,279
can see this a wee bit

401
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,560
uh basically you have a staking contract

402
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,240
and you just need to address of that

403
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,260
contract

404
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,699
and right here you have this thing

405
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:36,060
called ABI the ABI stands for I think

406
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,639
application byte interface or byte code

407
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,440
interface or something like that it's

408
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,540
ABI you can look up with a real meaning

409
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,339
I'm from Texas we don't read Wells

410
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,839
anyway so

411
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,639
foreign

412
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,079
so what do you do is you have the

413
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,820
contract address anytime you publish a

414
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,760
contract to the to the blockchain it has

415
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,399
a address it starts with 0x something

416
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,279
it's a long hexadecimal address

417
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,620
but to interact with it you need the ABI

418
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,440
the API is kind of like an API it tells

419
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,180
all the functions all the things that

420
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,160
are related to the blockchain and you

421
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,680
have to have a signer the signer is your

422
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,019
private key essentially in other words

423
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,860
right and to interact with this if say

424
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,480
this is a staking contract and I want

425
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
the stake ether to this contract what I

426
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,060
would do is I would say stake I would

427
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,800
just I would just I would initiate the

428
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
contract

429
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,339
right and then I can just pass that and

430
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,019
I say stick

431
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,079
and oh ethereum and most stuff on

432
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,720
ethereum is 18 digits

433
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
right that's 18 digits which is a long

434
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,100
number so what you have to do is

435
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
sometimes you take a your parse hit and

436
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,660
all that stuff and the right here is

437
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,459
asking for a term because there's always

438
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,620
a stake in term you can stick it for I

439
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,940
mean usually you're going to take it for

440
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,160
a year you can stake it for 30 days or

441
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,019
whatever but basically that's how you

442
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,779
were interact with with a contract now

443
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,339
what's interesting about this is is

444
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,079
eventually when y'all start doing

445
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,540
assessments on these contracts I mean

446
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,000
not even a contract with the web app

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,679
piece you should Under start

448
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,599
understanding how you interact with the

449
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,780
blockchain because surely this is going

450
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,000
to come up everybody's doing web3 still

451
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,760
even though nfts dot down I'm confident

452
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,380
that y'all are going to start having an

453
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,780
understanding what this all this stuff

454
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,699
is about

455
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,679
you can actually create a wallet

456
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,959
programmatically too with with ethers

457
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,760
you don't have to and so this is

458
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,960
actually used for a couple of different

459
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,660
reasons and up here you see I'm saying

460
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
hey cool this this Library called ethers

461
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,580
this is Javascript uh and I want to

462
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,559
create a random wallet and now what the

463
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,600
wallet is my wallet now the reason why

464
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,179
you would do this is because on the back

465
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:47,160
end sometimes you might want to do

466
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,380
transactions on the back end on a server

467
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,260
and so you need a wallet on the server

468
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,400
right

469
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,320
and so that wallet is essentially going

470
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,660
to be a hot wallet and how you do it you

471
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,179
create that wallet ID you create this

472
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,220
wallet and it's going to return it's

473
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,780
going to return your purple key your

474
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,940
private key uh and it's going to return

475
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,020
a a seed phrase for sure a seed phrase

476
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,660
is a mnemonic a mnemonic it's like a

477
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,080
passphrase it's usually you know 14 14

478
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,820
words 12 words it's something like that

479
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,860
but anyway so what that does is that

480
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,320
that allows you to restore that so when

481
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,660
if in if you're doing a if you're doing

482
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,179
a blockchain application so you know how

483
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,820
how uh many applications I'm talking

484
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,460
about traditional applications you have

485
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,380
a um you're going to have to have

486
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,200
environment variables right and so what

487
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
you would do is you would put your

488
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,220
mnemonic or or or something like that in

489
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,080
the in the environment variable so when

490
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,059
the app boots up it has access to the

491
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:45,960
wallet

492
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
there was a plenty of use cases why you

493
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,740
need to have a private key on a server

494
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,780
but this is super important if their

495
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,299
private key I would say if it's used to

496
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,880
do uh you know Financial transactions

497
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,980
it's super important to keep their

498
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,919
private key in that server super secure

499
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,600
that's the main way somebody can get

500
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,059
popped is if that if that private key is

501
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,160
is doing Financial transactions and

502
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,539
there's some cases where you have to

503
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,799
have that

504
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,660
you might you need to make sure that

505
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,419
that it's good to go right and you can

506
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,100
even rotate these keys this is why it's

507
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,679
super handy to do this I'm going to talk

508
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,940
about a little bit of permissions and

509
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,100
stuff in a little bit but it's important

510
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,900
to be able to create a wallet to do

511
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,900
proxy transactions is what I call it it

512
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,880
makes sense we good

513
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,679
hey and y'all can stop me at any point

514
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,120
and ask questions

515
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,159
so any questions so far go ahead

516
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,460
yep

517
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,520
yeah so never never put it on GitHub

518
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
don't put in an openly all the regular

519
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,460
stuff that we have when we're keeping

520
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,520
passwords secure same same apply keep it

521
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,500
in an environment variable put it in a

522
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,020
safe or whatever the best uh thing that

523
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,000
you have to keep that secure

524
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
uh and also like I said you can what's

525
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,539
cool about this is you can rotate these

526
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,059
These are completely random

527
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,280
very low chance of any kind of collision

528
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,140
happening and I say like astronomically

529
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,640
it's like

530
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,500
it's like you you we get struck by

531
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,700
lightning two times when we walk out

532
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,620
this building uh for the Collision

533
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,520
happens

534
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,620
so you can create a random this is

535
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,900
secure you can create a random password

536
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,240
you can create a random keyphrase a key

537
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,980
pair and it'll be secure

538
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,919
all right solidity solidity is the

539
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,360
programming language for ethereum

540
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,280
blockchain there's there's a couple of

541
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,960
more different uh programming languages

542
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,059
but essentially what happens is this

543
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,020
gets compiled down to uh web assembly

544
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,600
essentially uh so when it when it's

545
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,760
compiled it's compiled the web assembly

546
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,580
and that's what runs on the Node okay

547
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,500
so the truth is you can actually

548
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,240
anything that compiles down the web

549
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,280
assembly can pretty much be used so

550
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,780
they're on other blockchains there's a

551
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,679
couple of different programming

552
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,960
languages used solidity was created by

553
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,360
the ethereum team uh there was a big

554
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,960
hack several years ago

555
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,020
it's pretty solid uh now but there it

556
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,520
was a big hack back in the day that

557
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,640
caused the split uh between ethereum and

558
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,260
dinner is like a new ethereum chain that

559
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,700
vitalik and his team is still running

560
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,980
but there's ethereum classic which is

561
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,260
the old version they got hacked big time

562
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,220
all right so this is something you got

563
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,539
to get familiar with too if you're

564
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,039
talking about doing solidity development

565
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:29,520
open uh it's called open Zeppelin uh

566
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,280
these people this company uh I'm pretty

567
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,720
sure they're funded they're really smart

568
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,760
people what they do is they make a lot

569
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,020
of uh

570
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,419
they make a lot of uh dependent

571
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,460
dependencies I would say so that you can

572
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,919
import into your solidity contracts now

573
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,080
and some of these are really cool uh

574
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,120
they have like a there's an honorable

575
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,520
one honorable means that uh you can

576
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,780
actually set up who owns it

577
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,460
automatically so if you deploy a

578
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,520
contract you own a contract uh so by

579
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,140
default a contract has no owner I'm

580
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,580
going to show you a little bit and this

581
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,159
is where some people run a file you just

582
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,900
like if it has money on it it has nobody

583
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,120
it has no rules on who can can withdraw

584
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,919
the money there's people out there

585
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,799
scanning for those kind of contracts

586
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,860
uh so there's also a re-entrancy attack

587
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,320
a re-entracy attack is a big attack I'm

588
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,640
gonna go over that and I'm gonna

589
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,039
hopefully get a demo uh show y'all a

590
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,140
demo for that in a little bit what a

591
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,780
re-entracy attack is is you is you you

592
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,360
export a contract by doing a transaction

593
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,380
multiple times before it can it can do

594
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,299
anything else you can you can

595
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,520
essentially create a create a a an

596
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,020
attack and I'll show y'all let's attack

597
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,840
and it'll can drain it can totally drain

598
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,600
all the ethereum out of a contract and

599
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,240
that happens a lot by the way we see

600
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,740
that a lot anytime you see these big

601
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,419
heists there's some kind of

602
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,400
vulnerability where they can they can

603
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,440
exploit the smart contract

604
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,900
we're going to be using this this says

605
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
remix IDE

606
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,559
what's beautiful about blockchain is

607
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,299
that you can there are so many tools

608
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,159
available now and you can write smart

609
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,580
contracts and deploy them from uh this

610
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,299
uh this remix IDE remix IDE it's also

611
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,679
another thing created by the ethereum

612
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,360
team I'm going to show you how to use

613
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,400
that in a little bit this is the easiest

614
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,140
way to learn blockchain I wish somebody

615
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,460
would have told me all this stuff a year

616
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,580
ago so oh look I've been through the

617
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,380
ringer and I and I've learned all this

618
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,500
stuff and I bring it back to my people

619
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,539
all right so this is a basic contract

620
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,400
here this contract does nothing of

621
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,900
course it's dot dot dot you can put

622
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,900
whatever you want in there right so the

623
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,880
thing up top is is kind of like the

624
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,080
licensing

625
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,539
then you tell it uh the minimum version

626
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,240
here of this this looks like a lot of

627
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
other other languages that's the basic

628
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
that's a basic contract and then that

629
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,240
contract you can do all kind of cool

630
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
stuff

631
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,620
dang this is hard to read sorry about

632
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,460
that

633
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,220
so this is a solidity event

634
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,340
and and uh and I probably I can share

635
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,720
the slides with whoever y'all can just

636
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,700
hit me up I'll try to share the slides

637
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,980
and make sure the team gets it but uh

638
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,520
this is a terrible uh this says event so

639
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,559
the reason why events are important is

640
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,299
because events allow you to write things

641
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,580
to the blockchain so a solidity event

642
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,860
allows you to write information that

643
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,260
information is going to be uh the the

644
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,840
amount of a transfer the the address

645
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,059
that it did you can put strings in there

646
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,159
like you know uh for instance a great

647
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,140
use case you know there was this thing

648
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,940
called the poor man's copyright back in

649
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,840
the day

650
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,000
and what a poor man copyright was is you

651
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,740
mailed a letter back to yourself

652
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,600
well what's interesting is I wouldn't be

653
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,640
surprised somebody you can actually do a

654
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,200
hash of a file

655
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,020
and then do an event on blockchain in

656
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,580
that hat you can write that hash on

657
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,080
blockchain to prove that you wrote it to

658
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
the blockchain on that date so there's

659
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500
all kind of Interest things like that

660
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,000
could be a product I mean I haven't

661
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,799
built that or made it but that could

662
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,240
definitely be a thing but if you think

663
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,100
about security logs and litigation and

664
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,559
things of that nature is how cool is it

665
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,299
now that what we can do from a chain of

666
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,520
custody perspective to be able to create

667
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,580
events on a blockchain where it's it's

668
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,840
kind of like it's it's International

669
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,419
worldwide and there's no no no no

670
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,159
fudging around with it because

671
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,600
traditionally when you do incident

672
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,159
response you're going to Hash all the

673
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,080
evidence well then you can hash all the

674
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,120
evidence and you can actually write an

675
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,940
event onto blockchain uh with references

676
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,340
to that hash that's pretty cool so this

677
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,960
is how you would write data to the

678
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,440
blockchain uh through solidity events

679
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,419
all right there's also uh modifiers

680
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,340
these are actually important because a

681
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,460
modifier allows you to to build uh rules

682
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,400
related to executing functions uh in in

683
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,100
this case right here uh so anytime you

684
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
you try anytime you do a transaction

685
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,419
with a smart contract that that's a

686
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,159
message that you send to the the smart

687
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,100
contract now missions.cinder is the

688
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,480
person who's sending the message every

689
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,640
time so every time you interact with a

690
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,320
block with a trans with a with a

691
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,720
blockchain contract message that sender

692
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,700
is going to be your address

693
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,860
now owner in this case and I'm going to

694
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,179
show you how this works in a little bit

695
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,700
the owner of the account is created

696
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,720
typically uh when the the when the

697
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,419
contract is created right now you can

698
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,220
use open Zeppelin has this honorable

699
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,340
library that you can use to import it or

700
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,779
you can just write it yourself and I'm

701
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,220
going to write myself in a little bit

702
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,320
when I get to the demo part I'm gonna do

703
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,779
a live demo I know I'm tempting uh the

704
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,179
gods of conferences and all that stuff

705
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,400
but I sacrificed Two Goats before I came

706
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,120
here

707
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,719
laughs

708
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,159
all right so

709
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,500
this right here token game is huge in

710
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,320
the nft community this is one of the the

711
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,840
best things that I think that we can

712
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,940
take from nft communities

713
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
so basically if I buy nft if I buy board

714
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,760
ape whatever whatever the you know and

715
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,220
there's all kind of nfts out there what

716
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,260
you can do is you can you can use that

717
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,539
token contract so nft stands for a

718
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,460
non-fungible token right

719
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,580
so that contract is a contract that has

720
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,220
everybody that owns the token so it

721
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,159
would have my public address if I own

722
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
the token on their contract

723
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,740
so what you can do here is you can

724
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,480
actually write JavaScript and this can

725
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,580
be front-end or back-end JavaScript this

726
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,480
is using ethers and you can say hey this

727
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,279
is signer again is essentially your

728
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,799
wallet and a provider a provider is a

729
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,779
RPC provider right

730
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,000
as I said earlier inferior is the most

731
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,500
popular one

732
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,080
now I want to connect to this contract

733
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,059
this contract will have an address up

734
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,520
here as we showed before the address

735
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,360
here is the address of my public

736
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,620
um address

737
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,080
so now I can I can do that call to board

738
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
apes and it will tell me hey yeah he

739
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,539
owns eight number ten ten you know 23.

740
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,299
Marcus owns that so now what I can do is

741
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,000
I can give authentication to uh an

742
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,620
application now

743
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,779
now this is actually great by the way

744
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,539
not talking about nfts but imagine if

745
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,460
everybody in your organization you could

746
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,860
actually give them an nft to log into a

747
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,659
web app

748
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:12,059
that's freaking amazing by the way that

749
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,500
could be like the new duo or something

750
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,880
like that

751
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,500
and like I said there's always

752
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,080
unintended consequences for technology

753
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,900
and to me like well they they did this

754
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,120
to like give their token their nfts

755
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,700
utility but dang I would really like

756
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,159
this because what happens is you can

757
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,440
actually from a contract perspective if

758
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,480
that key got compromised

759
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,520
you could get rid of it you you could

760
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
just cancel that nft

761
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
so now we can we can end up we can we

762
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,059
can create something like nft for

763
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,100
corporate and I I guarantee this is

764
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,440
going to happen I I just in my gut I

765
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,900
think this is gonna happen because uh

766
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,020
public uh public key uh infrastructure

767
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,960
and and uh asynchronous cryptography

768
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,240
this has always been a pain point now

769
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,159
you're telling me now I can download I

770
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,080
can download a browser extension

771
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,020
right and now I can do and you can issue

772
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,580
me a token and now I can do

773
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,020
authentication to that

774
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,480
that's the freaking it dream to me in my

775
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,460
opinion

776
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,159
voter registration all kind of stuff oh

777
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,720
so I take it in further voter

778
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,820
registration think about getting tickets

779
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,980
like a Ticketmaster bootle you know

780
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,779
compromises bootleg so all these

781
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,399
different things you can you're going to

782
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,440
be able to do with this same technology

783
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,000
even though we got you know a lot of

784
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,380
people got hot and bothered make money

785
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,520
off nfts this is cryptography people and

786
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,919
so there's all kind of you know there's

787
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,120
all kind of things that we can do with

788
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,220
the cryptography that we didn't expect

789
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,919
again you deploy the contract and and

790
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,020
you basically you would do some kind of

791
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,340
registration of everybody in your

792
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,080
organization here's their here's their

793
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,820
private key here's their public key you

794
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,799
say the private key remains on the

795
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,419
machine and they can authenticate to any

796
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,039
application you want to we're going to

797
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,260
see it happen somebody if anybody here

798
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,940
invents this technology

799
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,200
throw your boys and pennies

800
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,500
hard hat uh I love this logo it's a hard

801
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,120
hat with an ethereum logo on it

802
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,779
um

803
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,659
okay any questions so far

804
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,700
uh good I must be doing an amazing job

805
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,039
or a terrible job

806
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,039
all right so hard hat hard hat is super

807
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,559
important uh check this out hard hat

808
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,260
look up hard hat ethereum because what

809
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,820
you can do is you can have you can

810
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,760
replicate the a blockchain this is your

811
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,679
own private blockchain on your own

812
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,000
computer

813
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,279
right so if you're doing smart contracts

814
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,080
you can actually deploy these smart

815
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,179
contracts to your local machine and you

816
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,980
can do all your testing and you can do

817
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,440
automated testing too by the way uh like

818
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,140
traditional driver uh JavaScript testing

819
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,120
where you do it you know you describe

820
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,860
the test and then you try to do stuff

821
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,620
you can do this for you somebody's going

822
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,240
to invent this probably somebody in this

823
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,440
room hopefully

824
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,179
you're going to be able with hard hat

825
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,740
what you can do is you can you can

826
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,600
actually forward time so say if you have

827
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,299
a time lock uh contract right if you

828
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,100
said hey I'm gonna lock my ether in this

829
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,260
contract for a year you can actually uh

830
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,600
test that out in hard hat and you're on

831
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
your local environment you can deploy it

832
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,899
to the local environment and then what

833
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,279
you can do is you can deploy the fake

834
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,919
ether it comes with fake ether on hard

835
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,620
hat you get all these accounts and what

836
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,080
you can do is you can afford time uh on

837
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,120
on hard hat you can't do it on a regular

838
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,919
blockchain so if you deployed something

839
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,360
what I tested on a regular blockchain

840
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,440
and you thought it was going to be three

841
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,120
years you could have accidentally put it

842
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,380
in for three seconds and then people

843
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,480
grab all your crypto

844
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,340
so what's cool about this is any

845
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,500
scenario that you think that that can be

846
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,020
from a contract related uh perspective

847
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,240
hard hat is going to let you do this why

848
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,700
is this important oh us you're going to

849
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,320
be doing this you're going to somebody's

850
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,120
gonna give you a smart contract

851
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,520
and you're like how do I test this

852
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,120
right this is it right here now I'm

853
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,919
pretty sure that somebody's gonna there

854
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,740
are so many different kind of uh apps uh

855
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,020
every there's some standard apps like a

856
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,360
nft contract that's pretty standard

857
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,580
but people just writing these D5

858
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,080
protocols and all this different things

859
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,200
uh you can actually so first of all I

860
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,419
would ask them hey uh you created this

861
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,520
D5 thing did you create any kind of

862
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,520
tests did you do any automated tests

863
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,200
and if they did it's probably going to

864
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,760
be in this

865
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,620
grab the automated test

866
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,120
and then what you can do is you can

867
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,620
actually use their test and then you can

868
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,120
augment their tests as well go ahead

869
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,039
yeah so there's a there's a couple of

870
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,100
different things uh at RFC there's a

871
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,340
there's a there's eips uh ethereum

872
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,580
Improvement uh proposals eips is what

873
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,740
you want to look up so there's rfcs back

874
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,140
old school guys uh you know what I'm

875
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,200
saying he said

876
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,419
to look up specs go there also to look

877
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,220
up contract to look up really good

878
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,340
implementations of the specs for

879
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,380
instance nft there's a spec it's called

880
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,520
ERC

881
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,899
721 so efp is the proposal and an ERC is

882
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,260
the actual implementation of the

883
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,440
yeah yeah yeah erc20 is a typical token

884
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,000
so so usdc usdc is a very popular token

885
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,779
and that that's actually using uh that

886
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,840
was a EIP and then the Erp becomes ERC

887
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,059
which is official standard and also

888
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:28,799
what's cool about the open Zeppelin

889
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,899
thing that I showed you earlier it had

890
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,559
it implements really good solid uh

891
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,440
implementations of uh

892
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,799
of the dang ERC 20 or whatever it has

893
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
all those things that they Implement so

894
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,299
check out open Zappa again but hard hat

895
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:46,919
this is freaking awesome because what

896
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,279
you can do test test and y'all can make

897
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,899
a lot of money of testing these

898
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,159
contracts

899
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,620
right it's crazy

900
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,000
people paying a lot of money for this

901
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,899
how many people use nexgs in here

902
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,140
has anybody used an xjs

903
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,899
all right this is the absolute future of

904
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,859
I believe uh somewhat devops by the way

905
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,560
I believe that this is gonna replace a

906
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
lot of devops

907
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,219
type stuff right a lot of stuff you do

908
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,080
in your normal devops job if you do

909
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,940
devsecops or something like that next

910
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,219
yes is pretty awesome

911
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,619
so the reason why this is is relevant is

912
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,179
because most of the blockchain apps are

913
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,940
writing their stuff in next now

914
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,060
uh next yes as you see here is react.js

915
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,679
plus Express

916
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,440
so traditionally what you see in most

917
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,179
applications is you see people writing

918
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,918
applications

919
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,980
um in react for the front end

920
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,719
and then what they do is they write

921
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,000
Express so there's typically like even

922
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,918
if it's in one Library it's like two

923
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,440
distinct code bases when you're when

924
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,359
you're doing your uh from a from a

925
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,219
JavaScript perspective when you're doing

926
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,400
your whole npm yarn and all that stuff

927
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,260
you're you're doing it to two separate

928
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,839
instances right what's interesting about

929
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,060
next is it it combines everything into

930
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,260
one

931
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,020
uh it's a one experience

932
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,060
so you can write front end and back-end

933
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,760
code in the same repo and with the same

934
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,220
packaging and all that stuff so it's

935
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,440
cool for a couple of reasons what's

936
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,940
really cool about it is there's a thing

937
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,339
called versa so versal is the team that

938
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,460
made next year yes right

939
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,920
I I highly you're going to see if you're

940
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,800
testing apps you're gonna see this in

941
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,079
your near future because this is

942
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,300
killing it on the internet

943
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,800
the reason why it's killing it is

944
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,380
because you write your code in next.js

945
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,020
and the only thing I have to do is I

946
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,900
just have to put my repo

947
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,300
I just have to you know put myself on in

948
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,339
a repo like a GitHub or something

949
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,040
and then after that what I do is I just

950
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,560
go to versal and say hey here's my

951
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,140
here's my app and it does everything for

952
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,820
you

953
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,020
only thing you have to do is put

954
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,579
environmental errors in there

955
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,320
all the deployment that we've been doing

956
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,599
in traditional devops and all that stuff

957
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,060
how we do a kubernetes and this and that

958
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,760
now this right here is serverless

959
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,160
you you created and it does front end

960
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,859
and back end next yes is super powerful

961
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,480
because it allows you to write your API

962
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,540
in one folder in one directory and it

963
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,800
just works

964
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,440
and all your environment variables it it

965
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,460
understands the difference between

966
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,320
public environment variables and and

967
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,380
secret environment variables off the rip

968
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,960
so this is a groundbreaking technology

969
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,420
that a lot of developers are using and

970
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,800
some big companies are even getting on

971
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,599
board another thing that's cool about

972
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,240
this is in traditional react app what

973
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,400
what you what people are doing is they

974
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,140
write an app and they use something like

975
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,900
a react router and what react router

976
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,839
does is it it it uh it does fake routing

977
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,160
there's not another page and all that

978
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,640
stuff well what's cool about uh next yes

979
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,079
inversal

980
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,720
is what it allows you to do is allows

981
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,200
you to re it has real routes it has real

982
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,540
API routes the whole none it is

983
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,920
groundbreaking so if you're trying to

984
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,660
create a product or if you're looking

985
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,000
something looking for something if you

986
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,980
don't have a devops team it could be

987
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,140
good for any any company to do I'm

988
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,500
writing a lot of apps in xgs myself

989
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,140
all right cool so um we're almost to the

990
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,839
to the demo part here so rows and

991
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,240
permissions like I said by default a a

992
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,520
broad chain application has no roles or

993
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,400
permissions you see I said contract they

994
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,380
open and close and that's it that's the

995
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,900
smart contract

996
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,579
so remember this rows and permissions

997
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,560
there's no roles and permissions unless

998
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,859
we we build into the contract

999
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:48,540
well it says demo time

1000
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,640
kind of reminds me of hammer time but I

1001
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,480
promise when I be dancing everyone stage

1002
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,079
um

1003
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,119
I think that Slavs in this place but

1004
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,440
I'll talk about a couple more things and

1005
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,599
then I'm going to demo it hopefully live

1006
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,420
so frozen assets this happens

1007
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,460
there's contracts out there on this on

1008
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,960
the blockchain that have millions of

1009
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,820
dollars in ethereum locked into them

1010
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,720
could you imagine if you'd upload a

1011
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,220
smart contract it made millions of

1012
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,420
dollars and you couldn't get the money

1013
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,339
out of it

1014
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm gonna show you how that happens and

1015
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,720
this is a this is the least thing you

1016
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,700
could do if you're looking at contracts

1017
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,740
just make sure they get their money up

1018
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,660
this is this happens and it's easy to do

1019
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,520
and there's several examples of millions

1020
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,220
of ether out there that cannot be

1021
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,260
collected by the person who wrote the

1022
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,480
contract if I was that person I'd be

1023
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,380
pissed thank you

1024
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:45,900
this re-entry attack here if you take a

1025
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,480
picture I'm gonna you can actually take

1026
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,619
a picture of this maybe type the whole

1027
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,579
thing out

1028
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,260
but it's this really thing called

1029
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,480
solidity by example.org and they have

1030
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,339
all kind of different hacks so the

1031
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,200
re-entry attack that I'm going to

1032
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,240
actually display

1033
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,579
um I got code from them and I'm going to

1034
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,900
just show you because this is the E it's

1035
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,880
a really good explanation and watch that

1036
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,900
YouTube video because they're going to

1037
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,099
explain it way better than I can

1038
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,839
Okay cool so what I'm going to try to do

1039
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,420
here is go to remix

1040
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,640
all right so that's tiny but I'm gonna

1041
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,200
try to blow it up for y'all

1042
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,819
I think I can do it right here

1043
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,200
Okay cool so in in here

1044
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,760
um what you can do is you can have

1045
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,260
different folders and you can have your

1046
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,880
contracts in here

1047
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,980
the first contract I'm going to show is

1048
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,140
this one right here I commented some

1049
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,000
stuff out because I wanted to show you

1050
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,820
that you can deposit ether into an

1051
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,859
account and you can and I'm gonna show

1052
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,720
you the thing that you can't get it up

1053
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,160
and then we're going to add this

1054
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,380
withdrawal function right after that and

1055
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,280
we're going to show that you can

1056
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,920
withdraw the defense five minutes

1057
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,740
got five minutes God dang I can't do

1058
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,079
this in five minutes

1059
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,800
let's go

1060
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,060
all right so nope I have no contracts

1061
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,160
deployed and what's cool about this this

1062
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,599
thing right here is that you can

1063
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,940
actually different uh virtual machines

1064
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,660
this London Berlin all that so I'm going

1065
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,160
to use the virtual I'm gonna use this

1066
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,260
this ethereum VM

1067
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,119
and I'm going to deploy the contract to

1068
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,240
it so this says withdraw I'm deploy this

1069
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,099
contract every contract has an address

1070
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,020
you can copy that address remember I

1071
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,320
said it's hex 0x right here

1072
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,180
and so what's what's interesting about

1073
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,500
this is that

1074
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,359
on these virtual machines you have fake

1075
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,240
you have fake ethereum if I have fake

1076
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,700
ether ether is their currency ethereum

1077
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,980
is the network so fake you have I have

1078
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,040
90 it starts with a hundred fake eat but

1079
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,579
it cost me gas to deploy this contract

1080
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,740
so what I'm going to do up here is I can

1081
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,020
put a value I'm going to put 10 eat in

1082
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,880
here oh it's 100 eighth it's frugal

1083
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,160
it's fake so here that's right

1084
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,260
so I'm gonna deposit this right and when

1085
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,760
I deposit you're going to see the

1086
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,099
balance of this contract is 1 8.

1087
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,960
now it's showing me this this is just a

1088
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,000
helper here it says balance one

1089
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,160
but when I say balance

1090
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,680
it throws me to balance but there is no

1091
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,800
withdrawal function to this contract

1092
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,260
that money is locked in this contract

1093
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,060
forever and there's nothing you can do

1094
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,440
about it

1095
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,240
that would suck wouldn't it

1096
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,460
you never want to audit a contract and

1097
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,680
and give it back to them without the

1098
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,540
withdrawal function

1099
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,220
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm

1100
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,480
gonna delete this I'm gonna I'm gonna

1101
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,579
just that contract once it's written to

1102
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,200
the blockchain it's there forever there

1103
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,420
is a self-destruct function for

1104
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,640
contracts I'm gonna give you a book that

1105
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,020
you can read in a little bit it's called

1106
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,240
master ethereum I I have a reference to

1107
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,619
it

1108
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,839
but what you can do there

1109
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,579
what we gonna do real quick though is

1110
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:54,960
we're going to create we're going to

1111
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,240
uncomment this function

1112
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,460
right and now we're gonna we're gonna

1113
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,980
this automatically saves in here

1114
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,960
we're going to deploy it again

1115
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,480
so right now I'm going to say deploy

1116
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,200
and what we have there is we have

1117
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,960
withdrawal function now so I can deposit

1118
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,119
it oh I didn't pass anything because I

1119
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,500
didn't have no value here

1120
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,320
so I'm going to pop deposit five e

1121
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,599
and I'm going to deposit it and now you

1122
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,000
see the E is in the contract the balance

1123
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,619
is in the contract

1124
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:28,619
and now since I did my this I added a

1125
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,880
withdrawal function

1126
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,579
I can withdraw and it's zero each now

1127
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,859
that's how you get paid on ethereum

1128
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:37,800
so it's super important to that's the

1129
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,000
like one of the most important things

1130
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,579
you could do is is do that for your do

1131
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:42,839
that for your customers or whoever

1132
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,720
you're Consulting for your company all

1133
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,040
right cool next thing I'm gonna try to

1134
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,880
do

1135
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,619
and I got like three minutes to show it

1136
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,839
this is a very popular attack called a

1137
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,460
re-entry re-entrancy attack

1138
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,380
and I gotta go in here

1139
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,960
this is the code remember this code uh

1140
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,460
you can get this code from that that

1141
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,560
link that I showed you earlier you can

1142
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,819
go get this code and play around with

1143
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,359
yourself you just have to go just go to

1144
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:09,960
remix.othereum.org and play around with

1145
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,040
this stuff

1146
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,319
all right so in here I'm going to go

1147
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,740
back over here

1148
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,420
and and what what's what's cool about

1149
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,460
this is I put two contracts you see

1150
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,440
contract I put them in the same file you

1151
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,420
can do that right

1152
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,940
so now what I'm going to do here is this

1153
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,859
ether store this ether store is a

1154
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,839
contract that I'm I'm putting money into

1155
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,819
this is a typical scenario people pull

1156
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,339
money do all kind of crazy default

1157
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:37,859
schemes uh on here

1158
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,460
so the first one I'm gonna do is oh

1159
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,260
whatever okay so I'm going to deploy my

1160
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,599
ether store they eat the store contract

1161
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,280
is just gonna hold crypto and give it

1162
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,200
back to me so I'm going to deploy it

1163
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,339
I got it down here and what's cool is I

1164
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,839
can deposit money into this each of

1165
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,760
store contract what I'm going to do here

1166
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,500
is there I'm going to take money from

1167
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,119
several different accounts

1168
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,740
and I'm going to put I'm going to

1169
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,839
deposit money in here from several

1170
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,420
different accounts so I put money in I

1171
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,800
should only be able to drop my account

1172
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,660
or any interest that I that I earned

1173
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,579
that's the whole deal right it's

1174
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,800
starting it and I hope I earn interest

1175
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,020
is that's what most of these things do

1176
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,420
so I'm gonna do two

1177
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,119
I'm gonna just put one in here

1178
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,079
deploy and I'm gonna go to go to another

1179
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,000
account

1180
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,220
so these are all externally on accounts

1181
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,560
these are all fake wallets uh don't ever

1182
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,060
put any real money into fake wallets

1183
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,740
because people people scan them to steal

1184
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,780
that money all the time this is actually

1185
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,200
a valid you've done that

1186
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,740
go ahead

1187
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,520
the ethereum balance on the contract is

1188
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,500
separate from the balances

1189
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,720
correct Yeah Yeah so basically anytime

1190
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,540
you so these up here are the the

1191
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,099
externally on accounts they have they

1192
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,260
have ether on them and you can send that

1193
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,319
ether to a contract yeah but but like

1194
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,780
the in the previous example you had an

1195
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,500
app you had a variable called balance

1196
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,540
because the contract has that

1197
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,819
yeah but you can't see it unless you and

1198
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:16,200
I have a function so if you have a

1199
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,579
public function you can call it to get

1200
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:20,720
the get the balance okay

1201
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,099
oh what the heck am I doing I'm stupid

1202
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm deploying that's what I did let me

1203
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,260
try to get this this working uh

1204
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,720
all right cool so I I did play three

1205
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,339
Ethan here

1206
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,140
and what I need to do is I need to

1207
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,880
deploy I need to copy this address

1208
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,260
because I'm going to do this attack

1209
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,819
contract real quick

1210
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,740
so what this attack contract is going to

1211
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,500
do is before it deducts the amount that

1212
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,599
I put into the contract it's going to

1213
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,280
let me pull out all the money out of the

1214
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,079
contract by putting one Ethan that's the

1215
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,780
whole whole thing about this contract

1216
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,000
so I'm going to put in this address this

1217
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,859
address is a reference to the the the

1218
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,079
other contract so I'm gonna deploy this

1219
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,819
one

1220
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:01,740
and I can go to a complete random

1221
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,780
contract I'm going to go to a complete

1222
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,180
random with one 100 ether in it

1223
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,200
just to show so it's 100 ether

1224
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,540
and now what I can do now is I can I can

1225
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,300
do um one

1226
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,619
attack

1227
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,180
so what it's gonna do is going to deploy

1228
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,980
one ether and it's going to drain all

1229
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,359
the other ether out of that that

1230
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,760
contract so I have three ether in here

1231
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm deploying one and I'm gonna get all

1232
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,660
the ether back

1233
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,579
now my balance is four

1234
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,020
shoot up

1235
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,760
if I put one in I took everybody else

1236
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,800
money out and the reason why this attack

1237
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,020
is a lot to happen is because

1238
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,560
here at the end I set the balance to

1239
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,619
zero what you have to do is before you

1240
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:45,359
do it you have to move this up to the

1241
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,260
top

1242
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,060
and that would that would that would

1243
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,859
actually mitigate that attack you set

1244
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:51,900
the balance to zero because the next

1245
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,819
time they come into it they can't they

1246
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,440
can't get anything else up

1247
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,740
so what happened is before the the

1248
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,420
contract kept on hitting it to the

1249
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,700
withdrawal withdrawal draw before it

1250
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,420
would before it set it to zero anyway

1251
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,700
thank you very much for listening is

1252
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,440
there time for questions or anything or

1253
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,000
am I done am I worn out my welcome

1254
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,260
so anyway check this check this book out

1255
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,540
uh the book is called Master ethereum

1256
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,220
you must you check it out it's a really

1257

good read it kind of explains the

1258
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,339
philosophy you know every a lot of the

1259
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:24,720
things I've mentioned

1260
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,819
this is the Smart contract program on

1261
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:29,579
YouTube this guy is awesome so I I

1262
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:31,200
recommend building I've always told

1263
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,460
people if you want to get into hacking

1264
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,780
stuff build

1265
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,000
right that's my that's my philosophy if

1266
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,380
you want to get in a hacking blockchain

1267
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,980
hacking ethereum start building

1268
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,440
any questions we good thank you very

1269
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,160
