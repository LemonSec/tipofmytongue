00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,900
thank you thanks everyone always good to

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an introduction you wrote yourself</font>

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,619
helps it's great to be back presenting

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,239
at last<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm I always remember last con</font>

5
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,489
it's where they put the interrogation

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,870
light on the presenters so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,550
like i can't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">count yes welcome to my talk about cloud</font>

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,900
and enterprise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interaction of</font>

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,849
cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise basically</font>

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,129
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about is</font>

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,420
based upon my experiences doing

13
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:56,370
penetration testing so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> or get</font>

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,600
the benefit of seeing what we see with

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,419
our clients when we look at their

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,280
environments these days I've got so much

17
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,350
to get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the kind of maniac</font>

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,229
that shows up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 45-minute talk with</font>

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,240
60 slides so we'll see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes a</font>

20
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,908
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pictures are so I'm</font>

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopeful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I want to go</font>

22
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,049
through i'll do some really quick intros

23
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,610
and then we'll talk and set the scene

24
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,509
with regards to the types of cloud

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,969
services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist we'll look at the</font>

26
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,369
most common cloud services environments

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:29,669
that the I see when I look at company

28
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,159
profiles will talk about the idea of

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud versus on premises obviously</font>

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,829
there's typically a lot of opinion

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,908
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pros and cons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look the</font>

32
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,408
main part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this would obviously be</font>

33
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,719
about the security concerns around the

34
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,210
cloud environments and I'll delve into

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,710
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detail on that and of course</font>

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,020
I'll back that up with case studies from

37
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,298
pen testing and show you what we see a

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,560
lot and then if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got time and</font>

39
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're good enough we'll do lessons</font>

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,320
learned at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end just to round it off</font>

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,538
firstly you've probably all border this

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,100
by now but anyone in here a penetration

43
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:06,479
tester for a living yeah used to be you

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my right it's like Marines you never</font>

45
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,130
can live a life like this

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,239
yeah yeah I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right exactly python</font>

47
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:25,030
ruby or you know batch scripts or bash

48
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,189
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who here is just then</font>

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,230
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for security in a company or</font>

50
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,959
an organization yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of you</font>

51
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,548
just follow me right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the country I</font>

52
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,560
like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a little bit about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

53
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,750
company not many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of</font>

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,579
ncc group funnily enough even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

55
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,700
we've been doing this work for about 16

56
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:48,790
years we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200 employees in 24</font>

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,670
offices worldwide 200 of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,138
the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually have</font>

59
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,569
eight offices in the US now we've added

60
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:59,109
Toronto to the list but I am based in

61
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:03,220
austin the<font color="#CCCCCC"> austin office on 360 so i</font>

62
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:05,200
love traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously but we're all</font>

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,180
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US where where our clients are</font>

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,280
effectively we obviously put our offices

65
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,079
where our main client bases are if

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,340
you've not heard of ncc group you may

67
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:14,199
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of the companies that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,720
acquired and amalgamated together in the

69
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,970
US NGS software was the firm that I

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,389
joined long long long time ago in the UK

71
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,190
and moved to the US with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice tech</font>

72
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,260
partners mathesar<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and intrepid</font>

73
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,900
escrip are the three major firms that we

74
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">joined together in the US and that's</font>

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,949
been a great experience because all of

76
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,180
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we used to compete</font>

77
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:38,079
against for projects were now all on the

78
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,909
same team so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's great so yeah ncc</font>

79
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,419
though what do we do we do a lot we do

80
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,918
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's easier to it's easier to</font>

81
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,139
list what we don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what we do do</font>

82
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,629
right so we go for this total

83
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:51,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">information assurance idea but in in</font>

84
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,750
security consulting alone you hear those

85
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,549
types of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might get</font>

86
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,680
involved with on a daily basis

87
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,690
definitely out of my office so all of

88
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,810
the technology stacks you'd expect all

89
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,370
the types of testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'd expect</font>

90
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,790
red teaming and incident response and

91
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,709
forensics are my two main areas so

92
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,290
different sides of the coin a little bit

93
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,720
about me yes this isn't a very East

94
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,400
Texas accent right I'm from somewhere

95
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,699
else that's my visa not my

96
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,530
shot I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working for about 15</font>

97
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,780
years as an attack and penetration

98
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">focused consultant and in this very</font>

99
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,530
young business that we have after you

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,600
hit like the 10-year mark they make you

101
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,820
a VP or a director of something right so

102
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,860
that's kind of what's happened there I

103
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,969
run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin office and responsible</font>

104
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,729
for the Toller region which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

105
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously in I also run to development</font>

106
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,270
practices one is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategic</font>

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,889
infrastructure security which is

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,810
predominantly to do with red teaming and

109
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,490
pen testing all things to do with

110
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,590
servers and buildings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and</font>

111
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,720
hacking all of the above<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

112
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,400
other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coin I run the North</font>

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,169
team for NCC group so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to act stuff</font>

115
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,580
and I get to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> results of when</font>

116
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,469
things get hacked by the real bad guys

117
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,570
it's pretty interesting work on both

118
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,889
sides if I was to pick a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specialism</font>

119
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it's probably in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

120
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,010
aggressive form of pen testing that we

121
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,469
now I guess collectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> called red</font>

122
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,300
teaming where you combine everything

123
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,940
that realistically an attacker might do

124
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,729
physical social engineering you know

125
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:21,099
actual acts as well all together and

126
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:23,919
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great fun as you can imagine so I</font>

127
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:26,729
cloud a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys might have seen</font>

128
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,289
similar things like this or rants from

129
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">ex-members of Oracle perhaps on YouTube</font>

130
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">about cloud right there is no clove it's</font>

131
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,449
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people's computers obviously</font>

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,860
an oversimplification but is it because

133
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,030
really that is what we're talking about

134
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,599
and when you're talking about the

135
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,580
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> profile of a corporation and</font>

136
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,380
what they do with their data this should

137
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,130
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that people think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

138
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,080
most but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into cloud</font>

139
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,810
bashing and all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> above we'll just</font>

140
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a step back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at why what</font>

141
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,599
are the general deployment models that

142
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,000
we might see when we work with a company

143
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:03,909
that has some kind of footprint in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,099
cloud environment so the first one is we

00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:08,650
use cloud services to support a product

146
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,880
and a customer base this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

147
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,620
common with people that make software

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,949
right they use a cloud environment to

149
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,930
develop that software or the production

150
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,699
data centers that service their client

151
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,000
base using their software or in a cloud

152
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:24,070
environment they're not on premises we

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,950
use cloud services to support aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,500
enterprise IT and our user base so this

155
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where you are off</font>

156
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,910
setting parts of traditional IT that you

157
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,859
used to have on premises and you're

158
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,890
putting them in a cloud service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider</font>

160
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">five are great examples of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right if</font>

161
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,700
you take in what you used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have on</font>

162
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,350
premises and putting it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clan we</font>

163
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,539
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed service platform software</font>

164
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,160
or systems yep we work with those people

165
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well so the people that actually are</font>

166
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,170
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the platforms that you</font>

167
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,120
put your data<font color="#E5E5E5"> into we work with that</font>

168
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,100
side of the house and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course as</font>

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,840
is always<font color="#CCCCCC"> with consultancy you always</font>

170
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,490
have the fourth one where we talk to a

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,960
new client and they do something really

172
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,220
new that we've never heard of before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

173
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,859
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty of being a consultant</font>

174
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,050
and why I've been doing for so long so

175
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually though something like that one</font>

176
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,480
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we're talking about</font>

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay shamelessly stolen diagram from</font>

178
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,090
Wikipedia number one right so this is

179
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,340
the classic representation of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dmz this</font>

180
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,520
is what we typically think of the

181
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,190
external profile of a firm to look like

182
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you have your your border</font>

outer edge firewall your inner edge

185
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,530
firewall you have some environment where

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMZ services are your web services</font>

188
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,860
is that you're standing up and then you

189
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in the top left there the blue side</font>

190
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,650
you have your corporate network whose

191
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,180
organization still looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

192
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,580
okay if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does because there are plenty</font>

193
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,290
of you know industry verticals and what

194
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that this is still the very</font>

195
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,790
traditional representation of what the

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">outside of their company looks like</font>

197
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,050
nobody thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> they still look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

198
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,390
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody tells</font>

199
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,460
me they they do but really obviously my

200
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,200
point here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with the way in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

201
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we architect our systems now and</font>

202
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,520
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font>

203
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,440
cloud service providers not many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

204
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,969
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like this anymore so this must</font>

205
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,729
be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward-looking room it's</font>

206
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,020
fantastically yeah it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely</font>

207
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,120
different right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just</font>

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,700
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ with services in it we</font>

209
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,520
have cloud and all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

210
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,338
partner links that screw all of this up

211
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,530
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at just just kind</font>

212
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,660
of level set before we move on the types

213
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,549
of cloud services that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

214
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,370
familiar with from a category<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint</font>

215
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,339
you guys will probably now be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick sick</font>

216
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,720
to death of these types

217
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,120
acronyms with too many aids in the

218
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,990
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about SAS and</font>

219
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:54,000
pass and I ass I guess I should have

220
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">never really been on board with but so</font>

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's have a look</font>

222
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">software-as-a-service right we now know</font>

223
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,410
this this is ultimately again definition

224
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,540
shamelessly stolen from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikipedia</font>

225
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,800
because they are reasonable

226
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">software-as-a-service is a software</font>

227
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,949
licensing and delivery model in which

228
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,370
software is licensed on a subscription

229
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,100
basis and essentially hosted sometimes

230
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,010
referred to as on-demand software we all

231
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,930
use this now we do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

232
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,260
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here salesforce com google</font>

233
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,780
apps work they concur<font color="#CCCCCC"> citrix GoToMeeting</font>

234
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,840
WebEx this is all examples of software

235
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,180
on demand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we access how for a web</font>

236
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,400
browser right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most easy ubiquitous</font>

237
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,560
thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on every device</font>

238
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,290
everyone now knows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> relies on things</font>

239
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,109
like the software as a service platform

240
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,000
as a service slightly different but

241
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,190
smells really similar right at the end

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

243
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,420
do some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of development or host</font>

244
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,310
something and we need a platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

245
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,130
that and examples of cloud-based

246
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,349
platform as a service i have here as

247
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,930
well things like AWS and Azure and

248
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,260
Heroku and force com google app engine

249
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,790
maybe some Apaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stratos those are the</font>

250
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,100
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that in the development</font>

251
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,810
world you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using to you know host</font>

252
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,790
your middle middle tier or whatever it

253
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,780
might be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the platform as a</font>

254
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:15,400
service idea and then the infrastructure

255
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,410
as a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the big one right</font>

256
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,540
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one where you build entire</font>

257
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,089
environments using cloud service

258
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,980
technology so the players in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space</font>

259
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,400
there's some overlap but we're talking

260
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">about again AWS and as your Google</font>

261
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,280
compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> engine Rackspace open cloud IBM</font>

262
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">SmartCloud and and there are more right</font>

263
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,780
and this allows you to build entire

264
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:41,740
networks entire segment stand up servers

265
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:44,410
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you want in this room I</font>

266
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,270
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people will have been</font>

267
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,310
in one of these free categories in their

268
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,490
company because cloud service technology

269
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,130
adoption is on the right let's do it

270
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,910
real quick so anyone here at their

271
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,360
company

272
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,339
use like exchange or office 365 instead

273
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of traditional email yeah makes sense</font>

274
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,600
it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rise what about storage</font>

275
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,360
platforms like box and Dropbox and

276
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,740
Google Drive right<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely so you</font>

277
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,540
guys all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about and</font>

278
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,190
if you're in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering field or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

279
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,120
IT operations field you probably use

280
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:18,180
this kind of thing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

281
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure as a service or I asked I</font>

282
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,150
don't know if maybe you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

283
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,069
to say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way oh let's not forget</font>

284
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,750
them anyone that's sitting there really

285
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,700
smug at the moment thinking well we

286
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,590
don't do any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so this is not</font>

288
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:38,770
do this dirty worth of Denny Citrix now

289
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,510
this is not a cloud service type

290
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,790
obviously this is something that's

291
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,680
hosted on on-premises but I want to

292

<font color="#CCCCCC">honor honorable mention to this Citrix</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look at something in the pen test case</font>

297
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,490
it gives us so yeah for nostalgic pen

298
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,290
testers and people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are feeling smug</font>

299
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,700
if you have Citrix and you may still

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the same kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems i'm</font>

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,650
remind me to say disclaimer based on

307
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,329
what I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have a load of others</font>

311
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,469
hugely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right like most of the</font>

312
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,020
clients we work with now are either have

313
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,120
either made the move to this or they are

314
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,890
in a pilot discovery phase or they're

315
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,220
considering it you know at some medium

316
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,900
medium point the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> is typically true</font>

in the cloud somebody will yep

319
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,660
absolutely right so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,160
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Microsoft about office 365</font>

321
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,490
usually you're talking to them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

322
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,740
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> llaman and sharepoint and some</font>

other things Google Google Apps for

kind of deal right google apps for

things like collaboration servers

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:18,608
services like slack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> HipChat people</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably used slack and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hipchat</font>

335
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,579
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of how you might</font>

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,728
communicate with your team members and

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,589
then of course underpinning it all lots

338
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:29,019
of companies are hosting parts of their

we it almost now is the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

342
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,239
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than we're</font>

talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on premises at least with</font>

the clients that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work with so good</font>

345
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:48,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun so why why people make in this kind</font>

346
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:50,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">of move so if you google for you know</font>

347
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:51,910
pros and cons of cloud service

348
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,769
deployment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what have you you'll</font>

349
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,978
ultimately get to a similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of list</font>

350
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,989
as this this was from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

351
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:00,910
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found on vario calm but I</font>

352
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:02,949
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the points were</font>

353
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,499
repeating the same issue so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

354
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:07,899
condensed this for us let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">them really quickly so achieve economies</font>

356
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:11,859
of scale increase volume output and

357
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,449
productivity with fewer people it's

358
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:15,699
pretty might be subjective but that

359
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:17,679
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um reduce spending on</font>

360
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:20,229
technology infrastructure this is the

361
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,059
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> one right reduce spending that's why</font>

362
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I reduced this from 10 to six because</font>

363
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">mote the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other four were all talking</font>

364
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,549
about cost saving as well so most of the

365
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,069
time when when companies are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

366
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:32,410
this it's all about reducing us spending

367
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,539
capital costs no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend big money</font>

368
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,209
on hardware software software or

369
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:40,509
licensing fees globalize your workforce

370
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,459
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cheap well yeah we see that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

371
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:44,139
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't have to VPN into a</font>

372
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,748
central infrastructure to get to

373
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:48,730
critical data or systems then you have

374
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:51,159
this ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden</font>

375
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,119
not care where people work<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much so</font>

376
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,459
long as they have an internet connection

377
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:56,259
and a web browser they can probably get

378
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,929
to what they need to do their job so on

379
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:01,089
and so forth accessibility is what I

380
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:03,249
covered less personal personnel training

381
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,489
yeah using a web browser is pretty

382
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:08,589
intuitive and we do it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that</font>

383
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:12,729
complicated clients for desktop software

384
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:15,339
is starting to kind of drop off so pros

385
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:16,449
yeah this is definitely the type of

386
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,249
thing that you hear people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

387
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when I talk to my clients it's</font>

388
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:24,029
generally always about<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-saving</font>

389
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:24,029
which hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't surprise anybody</font>

390
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,139
but I can't end the talk there obviously

391
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:31,059
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've pros there's Kong's right</font>

392
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,939
and that's what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

393
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,829
mainly today about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security concerns</font>

394
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:38,889
to do with cloud service environments

395
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:41,319
and platforms these are the four main

396
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,999
areas that I could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and I'll</font>

397
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,729
expand on each each one of these of

398
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:49,329
course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is the actual security</font>

399
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,970
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform itself is AWS secure</font>

400
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:56,378
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of idea the platform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is</font>

401
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:59,740
Hiroko see secure the second is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

402
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:01,990
is your data secure with your cloud

403
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,730
service provider and this is a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

404
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,309
difficult question and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

405
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,829
question that will delve into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third</font>

406
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:10,689
one I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the beginning that is</font>

407
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,939
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for insulin response well</font>

408
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">incident response in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud has a</font>

409
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:17,170
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different feel to it or slightly</font>

410
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,209
different flavor so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much control and</font>

411
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,529
visibility do you have of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data in</font>

412
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,268
your system's if something really bad

413
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,879
goes wrong when we're talking about

414
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,939
cloud services that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really own</font>

415
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,279
you're just kind of leasing so that's an

416
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:32,620
interesting concern and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

417
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,019
one cloud exposure of systems and data

418
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,990
what important data are you placing

419
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:40,149
outside of your perimeter and that's

420
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,639
like really the main message around a

421
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:44,800
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

422
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">traditional perimeter right it's not</font>

423
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,170
behind your corporate VPN it doesn't

424
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,239
require me to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and plug in</font>

425
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,979
physically into your internal network

426
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,740
and get to a certain segment it's

427
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,929
hanging out there in in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clap so</font>

428
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:03,549
let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of these in</font>

429
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:07,059
more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok is the platform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> itself</font>

430
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:09,730
secure is the cloud service platform

431
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:13,569
being security tested to a comprehensive

432
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:16,179
level itself what could go wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

433
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,069
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pleasure of working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

434
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,439
security of cloud service platforms in

435
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:24,339
my career and there are a few areas that

436
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:26,319
it can go wrong right it can be to do

437
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,110
with the web application and the process

438
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,409
by which you provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> your resources or</font>

439
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,760
it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to do with them</font>

440
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,590
multi tentative nature of the

441
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,300
environment are you in a truly private

442
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,040
environment or are you actually sharing

443
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,399
either on the same box or in the same

444
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,950
network infrastructure it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

445
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,930
with the actual networking itself from a

446
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,490
software-defined networking standpoint

447
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,850
how they've configured things broadcast

448
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,740
domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs all that kind of thing but</font>

449
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,860
in the main what I found is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

450
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">last two it's the web app so the bugs</font>

451
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,280
that we've we found when working with

452
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,470
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cloud services have not</font>

453
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,060
been to do with the actual networking

454
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,650
and the tentative environments itself

455
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,290
it's been to do with a web app and

456
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,030
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the key to provisioning</font>

457
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,500
services you know you have all sorts of

458
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,560
really interesting bugs where you can

459
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,210
spin up on destroying resources in

460
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,860
another tenants environment all of that

461
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,270
kind of thing not because they've messed

462
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,860
up the networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> but because the</font>

463
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,900
controls around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web application</font>

464
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,429
itself not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough there were</font>

465
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,500
vulnerabilities we were able to get to

00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,810
other companies or other users

467
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,760
environments for examples so all of

468
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,470
these are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just examples of there</font>

469
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,570
can be vulnerabilities in the cloud

service platform or the applications

471
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,570
that control it whether it be web apps

472
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,540
or mobile apps or what have you that

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:48,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">could really put your systems and your</font>

475
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,409
interesting one for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

what data<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to put up in the</font>

all sorts of things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font>

well no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we use it for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

reasons you know employment reasons

security reasons what have you when you

489
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,690
put those emails and take your take

490
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,250
those emails and from your organization

491

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different problem don't you you</font>

so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about you know one of</font>

502
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,120
these big providers going rogue and

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something with their data but</font>

504
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,469
maybe they should from a marketing

505
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,939
standpoint at least and but they are

506
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,100
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what happens if that cloud</font>

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,450
corporate comps you have a question I've

510
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,030
been processed result for many years and

511
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">last eight months I've gone and become a</font>

00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:20,450
cloud person<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh good one thing I kind of</font>

513
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,970
noticed is that companies export their

crappy<font color="#CCCCCC"> c30 policies in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud expect</font>

515
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,850
not to be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you know I</font>

516
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,389
mean to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypting data at rest and</font>

517
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,340
it transit is just it's something that

518
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:38,810
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes naturally right find it</font>

519
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:40,970
surprising that it's done enterprises

520
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,440
and then they compound that problem by

521
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,390
saying we'll do you just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a move to</font>

522
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,240
the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots more productive well</font>

523
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great well the problem is that and</font>

524
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go onto this in a little</font>

525
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,740
bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem they have is</font>

526
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,570
encrypting the data in the cloud is one

527
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,610
thing but still having it in a usable

528
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,800
form for the cloud service provider to

529
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,270
perform operations on it is another and

530
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,560
that's where technologies like

531
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,210
searchable encryption have come into

532
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">play and there are companies are</font>

533
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,440
mentioned later but ciphercloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> volt</font>

534
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">eve those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always spring to mind because</font>

535
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have a solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that lets you</font>

536
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,050
encrypt your data before it leaves your

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,790
premises and goes up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud but</font>

538
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,470
it's still in a format that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud</font>

539
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,300
service provider can use it's still

540
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,280
email it's just the body is encrypted

541
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,500
for example so that is an interesting

542
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,270
dynamic and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting problem but</font>

543
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,130
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should we should apply</font>

544
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,300
the same security policies and

545
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,280
understanding that we have for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

enterprise data into the data when it's

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud</font>

548
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:37,550
practices that would be a natural thing

549
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">say well gee I can't do the same things</font>

550
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:42,980
in enterprise what can I do oh yeah

551
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely and the problem is it's not</font>

552
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,640
natively supported with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

553
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,010
platforms which is why and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read my own</font>

554
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind products like ciphercloud and</font>

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,309

556
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,479
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at and that's how</font>

557

they you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are third-party</font>

558
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,830
quite quick to market solutions that try

559
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to answer this problem you have an</font>

560
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,620
appliance on your network that is

561
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,720
effectively a gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> that holds the</font>

562

keys the keys never leave your company

563
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,190
so all the encryption and decryption

564
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:08,630
operation happens on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that box but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

565
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,429
happens in such a way that it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,260
functional email with a header and all

this good stuff so it can be searched

568
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,379
and used by exchange of all that so yeah

569
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:22,190
it needs to happen and it happens not as

570
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:26,000
much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insulin</font>

adequate adequate logging on these

577
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:43,280
platforms for a start you know can you

578
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,050
access those logs what's the lead time

579
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,090
in sourcing them I've worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

they also complain about this and its

585
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,540
provide running memory snapshots for you

586
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,070
well do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount of</font>

you do rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud service</font>

592
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,020
well usually but it's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a</font>

when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to clients about their ir</font>

when we do I our readiness reviews and

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,520
all that good stuff when they talk about

597
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,260
cloud cloud environments which I've seen

598
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more is happening I have to ask</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these questions with them I have to say</font>

600
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">right how do you have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IR response</font>

601
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,730
plan that looks at the limitations of

602
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,920
the cloud when it comes to this kind of

603
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,600
thing if they do then we obviously have

604
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,570
to test it and figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

605
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,399

service environment whatever it is how

607
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,540
its access to

608
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,090
of critical importance right how do the

609
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,250
users access those services how do the

610
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,199
administrators access those services and

611
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,030
by that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean your admin staff that are</font>

612
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,430
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> use of the cloud service platform</font>

613
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:59,260
what does an attack again if they access

614
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,030
a cloud service environment as the user

615
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,740
and what do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain if they access it</font>

616
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,260
as the administrator should be fairly

617
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,970
obvious right you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users data versus</font>

618
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,240
perhaps all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data or control of the</font>

619
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,010
data also<font color="#E5E5E5"> though what about the inter</font>

620
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,110
connection between the cloud environment

621
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,210
and your corporate environment the

622
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,070
on-premises environment this is an

623
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,450
interesting one that sometimes is

624
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,909
overlooked firstly is there any

625
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,530
connectivity most people certainly

626
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,000
security architects<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

627
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,540
them and asked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> question they say no</font>

628
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,010
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think a go apart from this</font>

629
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,750
so you know you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask that</font>

630
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,000
question right what is the connectivity

631
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,160
from clouds on prep if an attacker

632
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,050
compromises a cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> host are they able</font>

633
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to traverse on to your internal network</font>

634
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:46,300
you might also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of course not</font>

635
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:49,630
but it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I gotta speed up</font>

636
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,070
here so case studies and these are as I

637
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,380
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> based from pen testing that we've</font>

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,240
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last 12 months some of it</font>

00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">really recently I'm going to talk about</font>

sharepoint cloud storage email in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

641
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,770

642
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,690
and controlling cloud data centers I'm

643
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about sneaking into the</font>

644
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,620
corporate environment like I said free

645
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,060
domain trusts and then a good

646
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,709
old-fashioned Citrix hack if we have

647
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:17,919
time for there's a nostalgic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

648
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:19,540
smoke but first so how well this isn't

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a pen test 101 right but</font>

650
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,710
what I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

651
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,890
techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've been using as a</font>

652
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:29,110
penetration tester for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 12 13 14 15</font>

653
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:32,920
years whatever it's been are still the

654
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:36,310
same it's great you only have to learn

655
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,840
free things and it's been awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how</font>

656
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,050
do we break into these environments well

657
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,300
firstly a password guessing believe it

658
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,430
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not password guessing single password</font>

659
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,830
guesses so that means we only guess for

660
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,380
one password so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run into lock</font>

661
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">out that kind of problem targeted spear</font>

662
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,250
fishing with credential harvesting or c2

663
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:57,059
this is a big part of our red team and

664
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,230
attacker model pen testing methodology

665
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,940
and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense because it allows me</font>

666
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to harvest credentials from people and</font>

667
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">then access cloud environments as them</font>

668
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:05,549
and if their administrators as

669
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:08,940
administrators and social engineering

670
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:11,009
yes we call people that stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

671
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,620
always seem so hokey to you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> pen</font>

672
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:15,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">testing class it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely works so</font>

673
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,739
these free techniques are really the

674
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:20,610
main ways in which we would get access

675
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,830
to your username/password examples yeah

676
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,479
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is me doing a single password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

677
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the password welcome one with a cap</font>

678
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,049
or double anyone who<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks that's</font>

679
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:31,320
contrived has not done any pen testing

680
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:32,519
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not contrived summer 2015 right</font>

681
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,340
now is the password you want to be

682
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:38,789
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good with a capital</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> S with a</font>

683
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,490
capital S sorry so single password

684
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,019
guesses they work they work because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

685
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:46,919
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons I won't go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into but</font>

686
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:48,809
they work spear fishing spear fishing

687
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,009
has been great to add to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing</font>

688
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:53,158
repertoire because it almost always

689
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,080
works we'd be on pen tests where we

690
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,549
can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in via other means because</font>

691
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,439
patching some good conflicts been good

692
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:02,429
so on and so forth what's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

693
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,929
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> people no good so ultimately this</font>

694
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:06,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time right we</font>

695
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,379
pretend we we would go to great lengths

696
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,240
to make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> convincing I'm not</font>

697
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:10,949
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those broken canadian</font>

698
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,470
pharmacy looking emails that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

699

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google spam I'm talking about like</font>

700
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,759
well-crafted attacks you know we buy

701
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,759
domains that look like your company's

702
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,529
domain we craft emails that are quite

703
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:28,619
convincing this is one I use all the

704
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:29,970
time from IT support you hit my

705
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">punchline you hit my punchline the</font>

706
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,360
reason this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> works all the time is it</font>

707
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:35,279
comes to do with updating an asset

708
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,990
register and what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the bottom</font>

709
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,899
it says you may be eligible for an

710
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,580
upgrade everybody wants an upgrade right

711
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:44,129
because their corporate machine is

712
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:49,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">steam-powered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like okay I</font>

713
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:50,639
want an upgrade yeah exactly you will so

714
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:53,549
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we attached to an email like</font>

715
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:55,229
this something like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

716
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Excel spreadsheet with a macro enabled</font>

717
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,850
it's disgusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gaudy colors because</font>

718
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,259
this is what IT departments do with

719
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,539
excel when they get hold of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

720
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:07,619
trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of profiling at</font>

721
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,590
work here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but trust me so sure and you</font>

722
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,000
know you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

723
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,100
crew enabled there's a security warning

724
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,409
Microsoft took the step to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

725
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,809
against macros right at the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort</font>

726
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:19,880
of and you have to click enable content

727
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,260
and nobody will do that right unless you

728
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,270
tell them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this tells you</font>

729
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,980
it says click enable macro and it will

730
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,139
automatically take your service tag and

731
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,539
put it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spreadsheet how many</font>

732
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">have any users do that pretty much all</font>

733
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:35,450
of them oh you know yeah it's come on

734
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,710
like you know click enable content that

735
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,480
stops you having to look on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

736
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,440
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop to see the service tag</font>

737
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,510
right everyone's doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so yeah</font>

738
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,760
we designed it so that it actually does

739
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,950
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service tag off the laptop it's</font>

740
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,539
smart you know it's useful but it also

741
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,120
creates a<font color="#E5E5E5"> back door on their machine and</font>

742
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,970
gives me full control mean we designed

743
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,029
an entire platform around this right so

744
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,140
I just sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wait for shells</font>

745
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,700
send all those emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit there wait for</font>

746
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,899
shells these are all machines on a

747
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,880
particular test that Rhonda might

748
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:06,889
control both windows and mac we have

749
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,360
different payloads and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have full</font>

750
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">control of them i can see you who they</font>

751
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">are and know that person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can run a</font>

752
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">commands on their machine and i can do</font>

753
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:18,230
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> invoke mimikatz in memory</font>

754
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,879
and just take their password out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

755
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,380
memory and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have they use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name and</font>

756
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,510
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah blah blah that was a</font>

757
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,510
long-winded way of saying I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

758
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:35,970
yeah yeah cross-contamination it's a

759
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,710
pain but not for me I get everything so

760
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,330
that's fishing social engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

761
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,460
yeah social engineering works really

762
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,929
well sometimes we have to make the

763
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,580
expensive purchase of a high visibility

764
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,190
vest or something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

765
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,689
cell-to-cell the scenario but we can

766
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,160
definitely start just to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people</font>

767
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get their credentials out of them</font>

768
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this does work anyone who tells you it</font>

769
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:59,730
doesn't hasn't done it oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

770
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:02,250
do we see the most well office 365 this

771
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,260
is the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> 365</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logon portal right how</font>

772
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,300
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if a company is using office</font>

773
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,480
365 while this Porter will tell you it's

774
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:12,510
fantastic right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just try food and</font>

775
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,060
some domain name in the user and then

776
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,430
you hit tab and then it will take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

777
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:21,060
that company's portal if they use office

778
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,950
365 done deal if they don't it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

779
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,600
you an error message right random

780
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:28,350
example picking on coca-cola for<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

781
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,520
reason yes they use office 365 you can

782
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,050
do the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with google apps for</font>

783
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,060
business right when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Google</font>

784
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,740
Apps for Business to<font color="#E5E5E5"> login you see where</font>

785
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:37,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">it says enter your domain name here and</font>

786
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,470
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that's what you do if you</font>

787
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,970
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group trust that's our domain we</font>

788
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:46,710
don't use it so you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an error message</font>

789
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,750
right somebody who does use it UT you

790
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,430
get the login page so pretty

791
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,990
straightforward very easy for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

792
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:55,410
figure out if a company uses a cloud

793
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,820
service email sharepoint is also just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

794
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,220
easy because of google docs right

795
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,360
because most even like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharepoint login</font>

796
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,730
pages that have been configured

797
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,800
massively like this to not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look</font>

798
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,450
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharepoint still usually have like</font>

799
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,830
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says sharepoint in it</font>

800
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,730
somewhere so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can obviously use</font>

801
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:15,149
search indexing to find out sharepoint

802
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:17,340
um cloud storage that's directly you

803
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,980
know with a domain stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dropbox</font>

804
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,110
see this a lot it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> toss-up between</font>

805
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:24,330
whether box or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox is more used on</font>

806
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">our tests but obviously this is an</font>

807
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,970
example if you're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to</font>

808
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,970
user names and passwords for people and

809
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,710
they use office 365 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox or what</font>

810
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,640
have you like you get everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

811
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,250
this is me logging into somebody's

812
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,160
on a pen test I now have everything I

813
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,870
even had a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on IM as then I'm in</font>

814
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,150
their inbox i can send emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them i</font>

815
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,340
can see what meeting they're going to

816
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can cancel it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want all that</font>

817
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,110
good stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember when we did all</font>

818
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,300
that spearfishing before and we did it

819
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,790
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside now we can do it from</font>

820
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,490
the inside we can do it as this person

821
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,200
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that spreadsheet again</font>

822
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,030
as this person so it doesn't have to

823
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,400
come from some busted looking external

824
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,070
domain or typos matched external domain

825
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,480
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can be really devious and i can</font>

826
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just find a spreadsheet that they're</font>

827
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,760
already exchanging with each other for

828
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:18,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">some reason to put a macro in that tell</font>

829
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,080
them there's a macro into using so

830
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,490
access to email straightforward also you

831
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,990
get interesting stuff because you can do

832
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,090
admin operations right remember i said

833
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,520
earlier what about access as an admin

834
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,800
well you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the right permissions</font>

835
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,710
so you have to target<font color="#CCCCCC"> people really well</font>

836
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,450
so when we do our targeting especially

837
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,250
around spearfishing if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to</font>

838
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">find somebody that like on linkedin says</font>

839
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,460
there except the exchange administrator

840
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,990
for the company they're receiving an

841
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,500
email right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> receiving an asset</font>

842
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,030
update upgrade email from me the reason

843
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,920
is that if i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their credentials</font>

844
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,870
and they've designed their environment

845
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,310
in such a way then it means i can start

846
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,320
to do interesting things i can add

847
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,750
mailbox permissions to another account

848
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,340
as then Microsoft tells you how to do

849
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,830
this lo and<font color="#CCCCCC"> behold you won't be</font>

850
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,540
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell right this</font>

851
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,970
is me doing that I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't see it</font>

852
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,620
but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is me adding the permissions of</font>

853
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:13,600
one mailbox to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailbox and then in</font>

854
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,179
owa searching for that person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

855
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">full access to their mailbox the reason</font>

856
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,510
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most significant though is that</font>

857
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,550
anyone who's done pen testing is hacked

858
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,010
exchange servers in their life know that

859
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,240
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bit of pain but the</font>

860
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,670
significant thing about this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

861
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,490
did i do this from it was my hotel room

862
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,410
right I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their internal network</font>

863
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,450
because it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud right so all</font>

864
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this powerful stuff was possible with</font>

865
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,460
just a web browser in the cloud yeah

866
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:49,039
oh absolutely like ultimately the reason

867
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we don't worry about antivirus</font>

868
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,139
anymore is because we write everything

869
00:33:50,509 --> 00:33:58,669
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> powershell right done deal sorry AV</font>

870
00:33:54,139 --> 00:34:01,309

871
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,590

872
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing right where if one username</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

873
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,129
password you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to everything</font>

874
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,328
this is off a recent pen test I can't

875
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember what this is called one login</font>

876
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:11,599
that's the product one login so we

877
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,219
logged into one log in as a bunch of

878
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,589
users and lo and behold we have this

879
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,209
platform to go to all of their different

880
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,129
apps and it's just passing the cookies

881
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,980
through and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work day I</font>

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> username and password their entire</font>

884

life<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your cloud data centers</font>

885
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,500
belong to us so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the interesting</font>

886
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,210
things so moving away from that kind of

887
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,310
stuff a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and looking at the</font>

888
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,849
infrastructure as a service realm is

889
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,259
that because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think anyway my</font>

890
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:44,960
theory is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dynamic</font>

891
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,569
nature of cloud environments that you

892
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,668
can spin up and drop down servers really

893
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:51,409
quickly and also this new thing that

894
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're all talking about called DevOps</font>

895
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,250
right where you have your development

896
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,530
team responsible for bringing up and

897
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,510
down service and all that good stuff

898
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:02,060
we've actually seen a dip in traditional

899
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,260
infrastructure security just like the

900
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,299
guy was saying about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wouldn't you</font>

901
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,829
just apply the same stuff that you know

902
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,000
you've known about for 25 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

903
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,910
you'd apply that as a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

904
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,560
ideally you would but what we're finding

905
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:14,859
is that servers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting spun up</font>

906
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,020
and brought down are not patched well

907
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:20,869
all the time now the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font>

908
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,369
that DMZ environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can bet your</font>

909
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,050
bottom dollar that's patch well because

910
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,270
everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

911
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,430
outer perimeter but this kind of rapid

912
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,250
dynamic throw up and bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> down of</font>

913
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,259
resources for whatever reason it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

914
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,150
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being patched and configured</font>

915
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,849
the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be they have holes</font>

916
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,530
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example missing patches on a</font>

917
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:41,900
host an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet facing host that was a</font>

918
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,609
cloud service host<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm allowed us to</font>

919
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,020
compromise it as system it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a windows</font>

920
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,880
box facing the internet with a

921
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,059
misconfigured service traditional

922
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">pentesting 101 we</font>

923
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,319
on we become system we found a domain

924
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,669
admin token on that box for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain</font>

925
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's running in the cloud environment</font>

926
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,989
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all just pent s101 dump the</font>

927
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sam compromised the cloud domain</font>

928
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:03,449
brilliant and there were multiple cloud

929
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,848
data centers and that meant we could go

930
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:07,439
between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so this was just</font>

931
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,539
classic pen testing but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

932
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:11,538
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet externally facing yeah</font>

933
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:24,900
yeah so there's two things firstly we

934
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:26,849
are under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ingroup agreement with our</font>

935
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,249
client but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually an</font>

936
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:31,380
obligation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to notify the cloud service</font>

937
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:33,390
provider the testings happening now

938
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,910
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pressure from their</font>

939
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,609
clients to allow pen testing to happen

940
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:41,308
as a pretty standard practice that's

941
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:42,569
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blanket agreement so so yes as</font>

942
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:44,189
part of our engagements we do make sure

943
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are aware that we're going to do</font>

944
00:36:44,189 --> 00:36:48,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that happens when it's this</font>

945
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:51,059
kind of thing when its servers when its

946
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:53,759
exchange 365 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using a stolen</font>

947
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,140
password to access yeah doesn't doesn't

948
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:56,489
really matter because just the clients

949
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,939
data that we're accessing through their

950
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,939
platform

951
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:07,319
well no this was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

952
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,118
private virtual private cloud so this

953
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,700
was actually specific to that firm this

954
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,930
was not the cloud services admin because

955
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,669
that exists at a level above the

956
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:19,410
hypervisor right so but to that end what

957
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,720
happens when you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised cloud</font>

958
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,129
service environments or cloud data

959
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,348
centers as we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> call them as the</font>

960
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,440
main admin well you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly go</font>

961
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:30,180
between that and other data centers that

962
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,450
that client has set up because usually

963
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,879
it's one domain right so you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

964
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,950
know Australia<font color="#E5E5E5"> to different zone all</font>

965
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,380
that good stuff but then we also had

966
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,779
this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised the DC in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

967
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,609
once we were on the DC we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

968
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:46,319
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to trust to the internal</font>

969
00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:48,960
domain controller in their internal

970
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,150
network and a direct connection via IP

971
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">set so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this kind of situation</font>

972
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,599
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise the cloud</font>

973
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:56,400
environment and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just prover</font>

974
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,069
straight to the domain controller in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate enterprise environment double</font>

976
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,730
whammy yes sir

977
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:25,609
well it's it's both<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font>

978
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:28,380
the point that yeah right yeah that you

979
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:30,540
you're both you're both right basically

980
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's exactly that that they've</font>

981
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,240
people that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have moved things</font>

982
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,069
outside of the perimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not</font>

983
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,810
considered what a big move that was and

984
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:38,550
at the same time they've not taken the

985
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:40,049
enterprise security lessons they've

986
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,240
learned over the last 25 years and

987
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:46,319
applied it to the cloud environments and

988
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,640
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a certain amount of</font>

989
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,040
assumption that the cloud service

990
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,540
providers taking care of this for you

991
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,819
but the cloud service providers not

992
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:58,170
there to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you against yourself</font>

993
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:59,190
not really okay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> right exactly it's</font>

994
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">not then I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to call you up and</font>

995
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:04,550
say hey you've got a domain trust you

996
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,550
maybe want to like turn that off

997
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:14,790
potentially you just have a security

998
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,160

00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">i include citrix in here is because the</font>

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,189
because anyone who's done pen testing if

00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,598
I you have a worse problem to a degree

1011

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,880
just like a few clicks to get to this

1015

the corporate network usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1018
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,960
problem is the same if i can get to this

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I've got like five minutes so I</font>

1025
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:17,089
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to obviously do the lessons learned</font>

with you and by now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be</font>

directions but the easiest entry points

1029
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,250
still definitely deliver right from a

pen tester or attacker standpoint

1031

1033
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:32,920
that's all we really use on our honor

extreme pen<font color="#CCCCCC"> test or red team dentist</font>

1035
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,460
your general control of assets should be

1036
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,930
a worry for you because they're not

1037
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,089
really within<font color="#E5E5E5"> your control in the way</font>

1038
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,950
that they were previously your data

security and your confidentiality of

1040
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,480
that data should also be a worry for you

1041
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:48,769
the exposure of those systems just like

1042
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,140
this gentleman said like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're now</font>

people access these let me go through

1050
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,529
these really really quick so as I said

1051
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,450
easiest entry points still deliver guess

1052
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:12,829
the passwords fish the passwords as for

1053
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the passwords i don't care if it's about</font>

1055
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,460
passwords eventually probably quite

1056
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:22,308
quickly how much control of assets do

1057
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,140
you have it really does vary<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font>

1058
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:25,640
depends on the SLA it depends on the

00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,500
tiering you've paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1061
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,150

1062
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,950
environment all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different factors</font>

1063
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:35,839
definitely a trade-off you should use

1064
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,210
these considerations to decide which

1065
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,970
systems do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> host in the cloud which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">day what data do you place in the cloud</font>

1067
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would argue that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1068
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,750
like paranoid version of this from a

1071
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,839

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> email sorry forensics and incident</font>

1073
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:00,558
response now this is definitely getting

1074
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">better right things have definitely</font>

1075
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:06,079
changed we do have and we do routinely

1076
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:07,789
carry out investigations in the cloud in

1077
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,559
fact there's a lot of benefits to it in

1078
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,059
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that we're able to quickly take</font>

1079
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,670
snapshot or have the customer take

1080

snapshots share them with<font color="#CCCCCC"> RS free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucket</font>

1081
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:19,430
if it's amazon spin up a cloud forensics

1082
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,410
like investigation server attached to

1083

that image<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't actually have to go</font>

the you know write blocker acquisition

1087
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,880
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are definitely good good</font>

1088
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,080
things here when it comes to logging

1089
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,820
though and what the cloud service

1090
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,410
provider itself is going to give to you

1091
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,970
during investigation it can drastically

1092
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:42,440
vary some quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen shots as your if</font>

1093
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,169
you've ever used as yours pretty easy to

1094
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,630
do a capture of a running machine right

1095
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,020
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> is true with AWS take a</font>

1096
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:53,630
snapshot boom easy move that to your

1097
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,190
forensic investigators environment and

1098
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,600
now they can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it as a clean copy</font>

1099
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:02,360
of that data data security yes email

1100
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">great example so is online storage do</font>

1101
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,280
you trust your cloud service provider do

1102
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you trust their security for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">people their risk register stops with</font>

1104
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,799
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> question and they say yeah we do</font>

1105
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've made</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that decision and I'm not</font>

1106
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily going to say that's wrong</font>

1107
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,180
but I can definitely tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1108
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:20,660
our clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to that question</font>

1109
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,609
is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> we done so they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this</font>

1110
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,350
other problem you know perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1111
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:27,530
putting data in the cloud that you can

1112
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,750
either afford to lose or have exposed is

1113
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:32,240
one angle not great angle though is it

1114
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,250
which is why these companies like volt

1115
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">even ciphercloud and other people on the</font>

1116
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,910
market that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make cloud</font>

1117
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,010
encryption products of being so

1118
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:41,270
successful because it allows you to then

1119
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,390
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the cloud service</font>

1120
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:50,270

only ever has encrypted data exposure of

1122
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,859
those systems definitely there should be

what traversal paths does that afford to

00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:32,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">the attacker into our corporate</font>

1141
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:35,210
environment that's the whiteboard

1142
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:35,960
exercise you start with but it's the one

1143
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:38,780
that not many

1144
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,609
people are doing so take it from me you

1145
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:44,030
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at that just just do that</font>

1146
00:44:40,609 --> 00:44:45,890
assumption and move on last but of

1147
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,510
course not least authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1148
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,950
access control it should be screaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1149
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,960
you by now that use names and passwords

1150
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,118
are not a good thing to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it</font>

1151
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,420
comes to this kind of vital data in a

1152
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,920
globally accessible environment

1153
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,990
multi-factor authentication is of course

1154
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,089
the terminology that we now use to

1155
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,250
replace<font color="#E5E5E5"> the just the something we know</font>

1156
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:06,310
with the something we have as well the

1157
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:08,750
token the fault there are a few examples

1158
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:11,839
Google Authenticator if you want if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1159
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,970
like open source with no support you

1160
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,619
have to handle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself companies</font>

1161
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,970
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> doer Authenticator that a close</font>

1162
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,800
source of course but they have

<font color="#CCCCCC">Enterprise Support so they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help you</font>

1164

roll out RSA tokens don't laugh they

1165
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:26,990
will still be useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this purpose of</font>

1166
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,640
course also consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things like</font>

1168
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,960
one-time passwords right so exactly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1169
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,400

1172
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:42,410
gets the credentials the username and

1173
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,990
password mfa will stop them getting past

1174
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:48,859
that easily it won't stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> them getting</font>

1175
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:49,970
past it completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but by the way a</font>

1176
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:51,619
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't realize there is</font>

1177
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,660
native support for multi-factor

1178
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:56,599
authentication available in a lot of

1179

<font color="#CCCCCC">these platforms already like this may of</font>

1180
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:02,750
last year office 365 suddenly turned on

1181
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:04,730
the support for SMS based codes to be

1182
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,960
sent to your phone this used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only be</font>

1183
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,150
for administrators and now it's for

1184
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,089
every user type in exchange for office

1185
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:14,000
365 so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a cell phone right</font>

1186
00:46:11,089 --> 00:46:15,859
having a code texted to us is definitely

1187
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,839
a better additional step than just

1188
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:19,970
having a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password the same</font>

1191
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,690
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a silver bullet though of</font>

1192
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,070
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentest is a great kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">are always be other things something</font>

00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:34,430
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I broke into a system on a</font>

1196
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,130
site recently and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,849
can clone any Google Authenticator token

1199
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,320
that they use in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their organization this</font>

is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively the cryptographic</font>

1201
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,920
data behind that token so securing this

1202
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,230
is not a burden on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

1203
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,240
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had several pentest swear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font>

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,070

1205
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">google authenticator</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but things like RSA</font>

1206
00:46:54,070 --> 00:47:00,030
soft tokens by just stumbling upon an

1207
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:02,110
open file share that had them all in it

1208
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,550
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> not realizing what they've got</font>

1209
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,050
there right this shouldn't be stored on

1210
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,870
your network this is really important

1211
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,550
stuff and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our fishing and</font>

1212
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,380
coercion standpoint when we go up

1213
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:14,860
against a firm that<font color="#CCCCCC"> does have good MFA</font>

1214
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,630
we still create you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1215
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,700
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fool them into working with us</font>

1216
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:21,450
so if you have like Google Authenticator

1217
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:24,490
backup codes or you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

1218
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,790
token thing going on and code thing

1219
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,680
going on I'm it way how do you die then

1220
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,970
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to frog different</font>

1221
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,109
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages that make it look like</font>

1224
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,630
me the token out of your pocket and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,000
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on your behalf so there's</font>

1226
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">always another trick up our sleeve then</font>

1227
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,390
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle exactly it's a</font>
