1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,250
just by a quick show of hands how many

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:29,500
people were here from<font color="#CCCCCC"> claire's talk okay</font>

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,930
nevermind I'm leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,210
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this talk is really going</font>

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,990
to pick up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a lot of what Claire said</font>

6
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:41,290
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe her vision of it</font>

7
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:44,650
is slightly idealistic because it's like

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,320
I my kids always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well is this</font>

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,899
possible and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well yeah it's</font>

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an and could like you</font>

11
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,059
know fly around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 times in</font>

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,398
one second but is it likely no so I

13
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:01,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's sure that there is no</font>

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,760
perfect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication technology and</font>

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,970
probably there never will be but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,440
real world what what we really need to

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is is mitigate risk so the talk that</font>

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,830
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give today is about trust</font>

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,979
elevation which is sort of fancy to

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,280
terminology for if we if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

21
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,570
you how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we be more sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,530
you and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:32,860
technologies that we use to to make this

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:35,500
happen so so this this definition of

25
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,990
trust elevation comes from an oasis

26
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,189
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> oasis is a standards body</font>

27
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,770
they they make lots of standards and it

28
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:48,369
was surprisingly difficult to define

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,199
this to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this term trust elevation</font>

30
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:53,350
some of you might have heard of stepped

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,659
up authentication so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

32
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:00,570
different terms that we use for it and

33
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:04,150
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with so</font>

34
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,490
Maya my take on on two-factor

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,840
authentication is whenever people tell

36
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,940
me well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use two-factor</font>

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
authentication I kind of think that's

38
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,780
crazy

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,940
I the best I never want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,709
two-factor authentication I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,040
walk up to the computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

42
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:25,720
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:28,179
ideal so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is a quote and it</font>

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,910
basically is saying like the technology

45
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,790
is when we can not have to do something

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's cool technology so two-factor</font>

47
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,340
authentication by itself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,340
terrible we never want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but</font>

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,840
practically what we're left with is a

50
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:49,959
situation where to identify a person

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,060
there's a certain trade off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I like</font>

52
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,890
this triangle you know we have security

53
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,019
we have cost we have usability and and

54
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,119
we sort of have to like in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font>

55
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,400
world if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are going to do</font>

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,349
digital transactions we need to pick

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,900
like what what a witch what kind of

58
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:13,390
triangle do we want so in this talk I'm

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,030
just to give a quick overview Claire did

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,130
a really good job on introducing you to

61
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,959
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the different technologies about</font>

62
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,109
authentication I'm going to review the

63
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,060
give you some of my comments and then

64
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:29,859
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dive a little bit deep into</font>

65
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,950
OAuth 2 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a API architecture that</font>

66
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:35,620
we have today for for authorization

67
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,108
that's useful for authentication and

68
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,540
then I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,750
issues around authentication like how to

70
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,170
enterprises or organizations collaborate

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,090
to get agreement on if I both indicated

72
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,220
a person how do I tell this other

73
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,380
company that I did it and there were

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,420
some issues around that and then of if

75
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,010
we have if I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of time I'll</font>

76
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,488
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

77
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:05,500
challenges so just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about me</font>

78
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:09,940
I started isp back in the 90s after

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,970
selling that I worked in the for a lot

80
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,220
of big companies with three letters that

81
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,769
doing security consulting mostly

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,279
application security consulting I did a

83
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:26,350
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of centralized access management and</font>

84
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,450
let's see I've kids I like pigeons so<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

85
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,090
pigeons are interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

86
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the start of our data network</font>

87
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,109
security problems you know putting a

88
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,030
message on a pigeon and realizing it

89
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,960
could get intercepted so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

90
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:44,169
older<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you think okay a little bit</font>

91
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,930
about glue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started the company in 2009</font>

92
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:49,210
I felt I was wondering why are there no

93
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,880
free open-source tools for access

94
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,049
management this makes no sense so we

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:58,719
built the glue server or our goal is to

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,610
is to make this software available for a

97
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,300
lot of organizations and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

98
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:07,419
developers for free to make the internet

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,669
more secure and to make our business

100
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,010
model around the small percentage of

101
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,770
companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really value security and</font>

102
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,630
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> need support and and and and</font>

103
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,070
more services so if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font>

104
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">one percent definitely come see me so</font>

105
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,219
the basic problem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication is</font>

106
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,590
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about normally a website</font>

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,810
or a mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> application and that's a</font>

108
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:35,770
digital device connected to a digital

109
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:40,210
network and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have in front of us</font>

110
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:42,820
a person or in the book of<font color="#CCCCCC"> neuromancer</font>

111
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,469
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the meat space so the</font>

112
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,780
meat space is sort of the opposite of

113
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,490
cyberspace cyberspace was all digital

114
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,289
you know zeros and ones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meat</font>

115
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,960
spaces like pieces of meat walking

116
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,180
around and doing meat like things so

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is the basic problem and</font>

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,919
this is what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this gap between</font>

119
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,870
digital and analog in and somehow we

120
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,020
have to bridge that gap and we have all

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:07,930
these tricks to do that so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

122
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,750
oldest<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick the much-maligned you know</font>

123
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,570
something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and passwords is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

124
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,820
you know obviously it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main way but</font>

125
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:18,310
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other there are other ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

126
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,940
we we can try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what you</font>

127
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,250
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a crazy</font>

128
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,650
tic-tac-toe board that one comes from

129
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Japan I guess they like pictures better</font>

130
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,818
in Asia and this one with

131
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,249
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern based authentication that</font>

132
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,249
one's actually used by a bank in South

133
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:39,960
Africa and basically you learn your

134
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:46,169
pattern and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put in the numbers</font>

135
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:48,779
it's actually a one-step so biometric as

136
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:52,609
there's a huge explosion of biometric

137
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:56,370
technologies fingerprints are common

138
00:06:52,610 --> 00:07:00,809
iris authentication heartbeat

139
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication I used to joke that I</font>

140
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:03,900
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invent one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called ear</font>

141
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,909
authentication because I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

142
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,029
your phone to your ear your ear is

143
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:10,650
unique and then I was joking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

144
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:13,349
saw like two two different companies

145
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,650
start in ear authentication so this

146
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,599
seems to happen to me a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

147
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,810
the one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom I saw a demo of</font>

148
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,710
this I think at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rackspace where that</font>

149
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,509
sensor is a sonic sonic device it

150
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,938
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually it doesn't look at your finger</font>

151
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:33,180
print print it takes a 3d picture of

152
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:36,060
your whole finger so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard to</font>

153
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,849
UM you know if you what I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

154
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize is that everything about people</font>

155
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:43,050
is unique if you could pull out your

156
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,990
liver and present it it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unique</font>

157
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're going to continue to see like</font>

158
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,169
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more types of biometric</font>

159
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:55,830
authentication and I really like the

160
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:59,370
point about biometrics being user names

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,770
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is although if you can</font>

162
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:05,399
provide biometric evidence it is

163
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">evidence of who you are but it really it</font>

164
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,860
identifies you but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a good</font>

165
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,620
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it and there's also</font>

166
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,599
privacy implications of a biometric like

167
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,909
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't change your biometrics</font>

168
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,539
so you have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful about about</font>

169
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:24,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you store it and protect it so the</font>

170
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:28,110
mobile devices is interesting this is a

171
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:33,299
this is of something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have you it's</font>

172
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,969
basically the it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most it's</font>

173
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,598
the best of device that we've ever had

174
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,969
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of interface it knows where</font>

175
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,839
you woke up in the morning

176
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:47,269
knows the path you took to work it has

177
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,509
is just a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibilities of data</font>

178
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:52,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pull off the phone to get</font>

179
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:55,459
indicators that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the person who</font>

180
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:59,209
we think it is on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> end so a lot</font>

181
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:02,119
of a lot of innovation there Claire

182
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:06,800
mentioned fight oh I'm actually a big

183
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:10,939
fan of fight oh I am I carry around<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,209
you to f keys so i have a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

185
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole bunch of them actually the there's</font>

186
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,500
two standards of at<font color="#CCCCCC"> fido</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one's called</font>

187
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:21,349
you to F and it's for these these USB

188
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,779
tokens one's called you AF and it's for

189
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,959
biometric you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> f is getting lots of</font>

190
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:28,519
adoption uaf is a total mess they're

191
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to make a 2 point 0 version and</font>

192
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,290
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be going nowhere but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

193
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,810
like the you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> F standard and what's</font>

194
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,269
interesting about it is that so this

195
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,329
device I popped it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of a credit card</font>

196
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:44,300
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sim card and this</font>

197
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:48,219
one was on amazon for five bucks so what

198
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">i like about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

199
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,730
reasons why two-factor hasn't been

200
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,920
getting adopted is because of the

201
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,110
economics if we have to ship tokens to

202
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,360
customers that's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal but if we</font>

203
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,209
can tell our tokens our customers go out

204
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,579
and buy one of these tokens on amazon

205
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:09,319
which you can use at our bank and you

206
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:13,219
can use at Google and Dropbox and github

207
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:15,860
and a bunch of other services<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's</font>

208
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,930
not just a one purpose one site device I

209
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,660
can't carry around 50 different tokens

210
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,579
for 50 50 different sites but what's

211
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,219
interesting about the economic model is

212
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organization doesn't have</font>

213
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,480
to issue token so the economics of it

214
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,240
are good but the really good thing about

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,089
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the organization can say well</font>

216
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,019
you can buy this thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 bucks on</font>

217
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:41,720
amazon so it caps the liability if the

218
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,480
customer chooses not to buy the token

219
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,759
then the bank can hand them five dollars

220
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,470
and say well here's how much you value

221
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,679
your security because five<font color="#CCCCCC"> for five</font>

222
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,990
dollars you could have gotten am a token

223
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,880
and protected your account

224
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,070
so it sort of provides an insurance

225
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,260
policy and caps<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> liability of a</font>

226
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">class-action just by supporting it and</font>

227
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,189
it costs nothing to support so fight oh

228
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,310
I think so real it's a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

229
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it presents a token business</font>

230
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,839
model and economic model that's

231
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,630
attractive for consumer facing

232
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:20,080
organizations so okay oops we have

233
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,660
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of types of tokens these</font>

234
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,640
tokens on the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's a project</font>

235
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,500
to be being developed by google it's

236
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,959
like a whole like Sakura Linux operating

237
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,380
system on a USB and then we have the

238
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,199
traditional you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know time-based OTP</font>

239
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,450
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to see more</font>

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,570
tokens and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> price of tokens is coming</font>

241
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:45,940
way down and standards for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tokens is</font>

242
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:48,490
helping make that happen so crypto

243
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,920
technology either in the phone like a

244
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,350
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a PC there's</font>

245
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,670
actually a crypto device on most people

246
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,950
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about it but it's there on</font>

247
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,260
your motherboard the same type of thing

248
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,360
can be put into the phone or you could

249
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a secure crypto element on an SD</font>

250
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">card that you put in your phone</font>

251
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically think of it like a smart card</font>

252
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,040
but be cut but the smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> card how do you</font>

253
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,339
put a smart card into your phone there's

254
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,910
no way so I think smart cards are next

255
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:18,490
so yeah we the government loves smart

256
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:21,730
cards a lot of national<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments are</font>

257
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:25,690
issuing smart cards they're issued used

258
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,880
for state and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also for companies use</font>

259
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:31,980
them the problem is is you need a smart

260
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,959
card reader nobody has one of those so

261
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,579
anyway but is these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are around</font>

262
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,680
we're probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see more smart</font>

263
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:40,239
cards in certain industries like the

264
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,819
construction industry where they need

265
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,540
actually like a photo ID to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font>

266
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,209
multi-purpose and these smart cards are

267
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,770
better than the traditional like ID like

268
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,630
actually the 1i have pictured here

269
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,399
because that having a chip on the card

270
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,839
makes them hard to counterfeit so if

271
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,520
you've seen burn notice or something

272
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,529
you're not going to be able to like you

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,350
know whip up a smart card<font color="#CCCCCC"> in like your</font>

274
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">apartment it</font>

275
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,470
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so they're better than</font>

276
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:09,710
like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these corporate IDs and</font>

277
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:14,240
wearables this is a tattoo developed by

278
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:20,060
motorola it's being considered for to

279
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,310
use in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luet dog tags so and then Claire</font>

280
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,770
mentioned like fashion like but yeah

281
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,900
it's true you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this a ring</font>

282
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,000
rings an occasion or it could be

283
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,470
blinging dedication like maybe you have

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,260
a necklace a cool necklace or something

285
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,570
and that identifies you like that I

286
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually going to happen</font>

287
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this has an NFC chip in it and just in</font>

288
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,960
general NFC is interesting it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not big</font>

289
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,650
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store like NFC's writable it's</font>

290
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just readable which means that now</font>

291
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:54,130
the downside is it's not big enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

292
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,540
store a whole like large key on it

293
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,300
however you could use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of</font>

294
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,120
rotating token system because it's

295
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,130
writable which could make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard makes</font>

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,500
it a good option for<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and</font>

297
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:09,200
actually as I've been saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I saw</font>

298
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,650
I think two patents filed on that idea

299
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:17,980
so i think that's that's coming the pill

300
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:20,630
this is be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you swallow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pill and</font>

301
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,430
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours we would</font>

302
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:28,939
know it was you and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> google has this</font>

303
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:32,569
new like smelling capability google

304
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows and so basically you know my she</font>

305
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,460
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows it's me so basically you</font>

306
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,180
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put your phone under your arm</font>

307
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:45,230
and I don't know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laugh but it's</font>

308
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,479
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen so one of the</font>

309
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,250
interesting things about about

310
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,440
authentication as I mentioned going back

311
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,250
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first slide it's about risk</font>

312
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,320
mitigation and there's a lot of this

313
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,480
isn't actually authentication but it's

314
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,670
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like fraud detection the way that</font>

315
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone is very unique you</font>

316
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,339
use certain games<font color="#CCCCCC"> use certain apps you</font>

317
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,800
send certain messages actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

318
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,990
when i type on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone it's like i'll</font>

319
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,540
say will and then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to go pick</font>

320
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,370
up

321
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,050
kids at karate it's like it knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

322
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,330
whole sentence i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so</font>

323
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:22,490
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that you use your phone</font>

324
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:25,170
is very predictable and so this company

325
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,870
looks at the graph information basically

326
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,870
off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can detect if it's not</font>

327
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,760
you so this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very useful</font>

328
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,350
but it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complimentary it's</font>

329
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,840
not actually authenticating you it's a

330
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,660
tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> kitty you and it's not you and then</font>

331
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:43,140
risk scores we're seeing that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

332
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,900
banks are looking at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and</font>

333
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,030
comparing your IP address versus the IPS

334
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:52,680
have known hackers and getting a risk

335
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:57,390
score based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so this leads us to</font>

336
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,910
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation so in authentication we want</font>

337
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,240
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with like a good score now</font>

338
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">NIST had one two three or four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

339
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like our you know our</font>

340
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,210
threat level for our country it's orange

341
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what does that mean do I not go out</font>

342
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">today you know if it's the member after</font>

343
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,010
nine eleven there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these crazy like</font>

344
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,870
you know what do you do so we you know

345
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,700
so for is what the NIST has that's

346
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,060
clearly inadequate everyone knows that's

347
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,950
inadequate and then companies maybe want

348
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make more grades and they want to</font>

349
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,690
make grades that are perhaps

350
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,090
transferable between companies but it

351
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,520
starts to get really complicated because

352
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:39,690
even if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at let's say password</font>

353
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:43,170
is one and you be key or you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> F is too</font>

354
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:45,450
and you know etc etc well is that

355
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,589
password a strong password or a weak

356
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:53,100
password and is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> password how often</font>

357
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,410
was a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a device a</font>

358
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,940
mobile was it entered on a device that

359
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,290
is rooted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is that device you know</font>

360
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,880
have some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> look so there's all these</font>

361
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:09,440
factors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically go into making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

362
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,540
impossible to get an apples-to-apples

363
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,100
comparison of like how good is this

364
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication versus another</font>

365
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:20,089
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it basically leaves us</font>

366
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:23,640
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very uncomfortable situation</font>

367
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft did some research and they it</font>

368
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,829
was like a study of studies

369
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,500
they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at all the different</font>

370
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:34,639
types of authentication and how do they

371
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:38,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">compare for usability deployability and</font>

372
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,110
end security and in my initial slide

373
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:45,169
deployability kind of equals cost but

374
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,168
and what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found was was sort of</font>

375
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:51,169
interesting they said although<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

376
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:53,059
these technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more usable and</font>

377
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:55,700
some of them are more secure none are as

378
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:58,100
deployable as passwords and I think

379
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,549
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we see the</font>

380
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,309
vast majority of websites and and other

381
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:08,690
services using passwords is because

382
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:10,908
organizations to savoy authentication

383
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,120
technology and deploy ability is

384
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:17,630
normally the main the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern I</font>

385
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,418
have to say so as a company that

386
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,340
specializes on authentication I probably

387
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked to 20 different companies a week</font>

388
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,620
and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask okay is strong</font>

389
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,789
authentication an important to you do

390
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,729
you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> something better than</font>

391
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:34,760
passwords and ninety-nine percent of the

392
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,510
time what they tell me is yeah that's

393
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,970
it's not the main goal but it would be

394
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,340
nice to have maybe in the future so I

395
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,740
think it's maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the awareness of</font>

396
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,220
consumers has gone up about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two factor</font>

397
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,070
but the commitment of organizations to

398
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:57,409
do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the area as far as I can tell</font>

399
00:18:52,070 --> 00:19:00,260
it's pretty non-existent or rare another

400
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with them deployability is I</font>

401
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:08,390
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that deployability is basically a</font>

402
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:12,110
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offs if I have to go to</font>

403
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:14,390
each application and integrate it for

404
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,129
this technology or this suite of

405
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,570
technologies it's basically a

406
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:22,880
non-starter so I really think that the

407
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:26,418
lack of standards in the industry has

408
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,260
been a key factor in our keeping us with

409
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:32,270
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see by consuming yeah good</font>

410
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:36,350
so so what happened why don't we have

411
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,889
any standards and so to just to give you

412
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,309
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of history</font>

413
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:46,660
we in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old days and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking like</font>

414
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:51,970
the 90s we we had older protocol

415
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:54,820
standards like radius and kerberos and

416
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,070
Elda I mean these are primarily you know

417
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:01,059
password technologies they ran on their

418
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,889
own port and then you know the web

419
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:07,120
started to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big let's say</font>

420
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:09,610
around 97 98 you know by the year 2000

421
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,669
somebody said I know let's use the web

422
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,030
as a protocol for authentication and

423
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:19,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">then at that point everybody and their</font>

424
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">brother basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of a way I a</font>

425
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:25,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">web api for authentication and we had</font>

426
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,550
this explosion of like protocols there

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,160
might have been 50 this is only a small

428
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:33,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">subset of like of some of the protocols</font>

429
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,850
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft of course had their</font>

430
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,809
own stuff WS star<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry if you ever</font>

431
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:44,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">used that we had old versions of open ID</font>

432
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,450
open ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and open ID</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too we had old</font>

433
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,490
versions of hola there's a sample of

434
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,460
standard called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liberty there was an</font>

435
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,410
open standard called Kaz and and

436
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,540
literally there's there's there's a

437
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:00,210
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of others that were out</font>

438
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:02,260
there so sometime around you know

439
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:05,950
2004-2005 we started to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

440
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,840
consolidation and sam'l became one of

441
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,270
the most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> and continues to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be one</font>

442
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most popular standards for</font>

443
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:16,960
authentication web standard so

444
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:19,330
everything looks great and then in 2007

445
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,960
of basically Samuel T was finished

446
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:26,050
around 2006 around 2007 the iPhone comes

447
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,030
out and we're like oh damn we didn't

448
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of this Hughes case native app</font>

449
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,700
calling api's that we dis assume that it

450
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,620
was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a browser and it's not a</font>

451
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,330
browser and then there's all these other

452
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were like oh what about unix</font>

453
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,070
authentication and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

454
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,910
started to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that the use</font>

455
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:48,428
cases for<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication extended beyond</font>

456
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,350
the browser mobile was going to be

457
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:50,970
really important

458
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,709
and of course none of the all the

459
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,120
vendors who built<font color="#CCCCCC"> sam'l software were</font>

460
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,710
like well we're not changing it that's

461
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,168
why we have the standard its final it's

462
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,789
done and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there started to become the</font>

463
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:04,890
need for new standards and the luckily

464
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:07,500
there was continued to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be consolidation</font>

465
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,690
the open ID and oh all communities

466
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,210
combined and that's where this open ID

467
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,970
connect came out of so the good news is

468
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:19,280
is that today there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

469
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:24,200
authentication standards in let's say

470
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,840
TCP TLS coming out other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than</font>

471
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">open ID connect so that no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else is</font>

472
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on anything the problem is is</font>

473
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,120
that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last 15 years we've been</font>

474
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,740
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know use open ID everyone's</font>

475
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,959
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're saying</font>

476
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,030
well use open it2 everyone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

477
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,919
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we're saying use open ID</font>

478
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,539
connect everyone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it and</font>

479
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">no one believes us at this point they're</font>

480
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,408
like a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm waiting for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like next</font>

481
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,150
year there'll be another standard so I

482
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:55,470
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry has sort of a boy who</font>

483
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:57,240
cried wolf problem but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

484
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,159
standards we have today are<font color="#CCCCCC"> Samuel and</font>

485
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,200
open ID connect this is forest or

486
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,850
research by the way and foresters

487
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,039
basically giving guidance on which

488
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,408
standards to move towards and which to

489
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,570
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from and so they're bullish on</font>

490
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:14,520
open ID connect as is pretty much

491
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:17,610
everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's in this industry so</font>

492
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">sam'l was great it was also an xml soap</font>

493
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,740
standard and developers were just not

494
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:24,929
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it so the large websites</font>

495
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,760
ended up adopting it but the smaller

496
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,600
websites were like no way we're using

497
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">json rest so there's there's in parallel</font>

498
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,590
to mobile apps there was really a sea of

499
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,770
change in AP is that led them to a oh no

500
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:43,260
aw<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 based protocol being selected so</font>

501
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:46,830
diving<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a little open ID connect a</font>

502
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:50,520
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so open ID connect is not an</font>

503
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,149
authentication protocol it's neutral on

504
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,470
how you authenticate the person or

505
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify the person so you got to figure</font>

506
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,090
that one out using like all the slides

507
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I went from before after you know</font>

508
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,100
who the person

509
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,710
is open ID connect helps you say to an

510
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:11,209
application I've identified this person

511
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:13,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's information about that person so</font>

512
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:17,090
there's two there's two actors in this

513
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:19,790
open ID connect one is that is so I

514
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,470
should add that open ID connect is a

515
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:28,100
profile of 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> op 2 is a very high level</font>

516
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:32,660
framework for authorization it has some

517
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:34,790
very basic flows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication one</font>

518
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,500
called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource owner credential</font>

519
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,300
ground and one called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font>

520
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,880
credential grant but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

521
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:44,120
simple protocols for exchanging like Kia

522
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,230
a user Damon and password basically but

523
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,939
if you need to do anything more

524
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,420
complicated you're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

525
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">profile Oh auth to in a certain way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

526
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">what open ID connected is they said</font>

527
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,820
let's use all the o2 jargon and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

528
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,180
infrastructure and let's define a

529
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:05,899
specific profile of OAuth 2 that could

530
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">be used for for for application</font>

531
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:13,220
authentication so Mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam'l there's two</font>

532
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,979
actors in sam'l you have the identity

533
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,690
provider and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider the</font>

534
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,400
service provider they should have just

535
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,060
called it a website cuz it's always a

536
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,610
website so it open ID connect you have

537
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,710
the same thing except they change all

538
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,929
the jargon so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having the</font>

539
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,860
identity provider we have the open ID

540
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:36,080
provider and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having the SP or</font>

541
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:38,090
service provider you have the RP<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

542
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,460
relying party and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having</font>

543
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,050
attributes we have user claims and I

544
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">could basically go on but if they say</font>

545
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,030
they're all the jargon I'm change and I

546
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,590
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to Microsoft then they looked</font>

547
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,960
at me<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what do you mean jargon what</font>

548
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,490
does that mean and I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave them</font>

549
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> example they said oh you mean</font>

550
00:25:52,490 --> 00:26:01,310
taxonomy we call that taxonomy so yeah

551
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:05,000
but it's it's working pretty well let me

552
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,649
dive a little bit more so so open ID

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect is for</font>

554
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,690
authentication and this protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

555
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:15,070
it's also a profile of 0 a 2 called<font color="#E5E5E5"> uma</font>

556
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,510
this is for authorization so

557
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,030
authorization is after I know who you

558
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,060
are you're going to start calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's</font>

559
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,940
and how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I centrally control what</font>

560
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:29,389
api's you're allowed to call so luma

561
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:32,960
defines this thing called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpt token</font>

562
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:36,470
the resource protection token and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

563
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,470
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through this the flow basically</font>

564
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:44,350
the requesting party is either a mobile

565
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:49,370
app or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website and it calls an API and</font>

566
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:53,750
the API looks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this rpt token if the</font>

567
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:56,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpt token is not there it obtains a</font>

568
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,030
permission ticket from the authorization

569
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,520
server that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number and and</font>

570
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,520
registers what scopes are required

571
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:09,050
scopes just a keyword it could be let's

572
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,030
just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's view so it returns that</font>

573
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:14,659
permission ticket to the requesting

574
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:16,850
party so the requesting party says<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

575
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,550
drat I'm not authorized but I have this

576
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,350
permission ticket so it presents this

577
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,570
permission ticket to the authorization

578
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:27,199
server and says I want to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

579
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,840
basically the authorization server looks

580
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,350
up all of the policies associated with

581
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that permission ticket what's the IP</font>

582
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">address what person is it what client</font>

583
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,139
are they using you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know time of day</font>

584
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,060
whatever whatever the authorization

585
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,340
server might consider let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

586
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,740
they say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm issuing you the</font>

587
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">rpt token then the requesting party</font>

588
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,470
presents that rpt token and can get

589
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:57,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to the API so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is the</font>

590
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:00,350
basic idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complementary to open ID</font>

591
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:03,470
connect so uma wasn't going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> redefine</font>

592
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,560
how we authenticate the person or how we

593
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,350
authenticate the client it's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

594
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,659
defines a way to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> API access</font>

595
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:16,939
management using a profile Oh ought to

596
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,850
so diving a little bit more into open ID

597
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,530
connect

598
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:25,419
so in 002 it just talks about a token it

599
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:29,470
doesn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what's in that</font>

600
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:33,310
token so an open<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID connect says okay a</font>

601
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">token an ID token gives you details</font>

602
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:40,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what type of authentication happen</font>

603
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,690
so the issuer is what Opie authenticated

604
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,490
this person the subject if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

605
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,240
gmail it would that would be your gmail

606
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">username the subject can either be a</font>

607
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,520
persistent or a non-correlated will

608
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,810
identifier it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the provider what</font>

609
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:03,400
to give the audience is which client

610
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this token was issued to or clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X is</font>

611
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,040
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> does a token expire I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad is when</font>

612
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,690
was it issued auth time when did the

613
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,790
person authenticate you might have

614
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,890
noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some websites don't ask you</font>

615
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to authenticate for a long time I feel</font>

616
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I can go for months on linkedin</font>

617
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,950
before they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Rio thent acade is</font>

618
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,990
that if i have a token in my browser so

619
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,150
that the tokens can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued for quite</font>

620
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,800
some time and and the app might want to

621
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">know when did this person actually</font>

622
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,320
authenticate this ACR one is really

623
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">special and it says what type of</font>

624
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,100
authentication happened and AMR am also

625
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:45,280
gives additional details<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what type</font>

626
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:47,860
of authentication happened the and I can

627
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">just mention that the claims let's say</font>

628
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,260
the person's first name last name can be

629
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,690
contained in the ID token or sometimes

630
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,470
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can separate this and</font>

631
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:01,240
have the ID token in one call and get a

632
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:08,460
different token that has the user claims

633
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:11,260
so so I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CR and AMR</font>

634
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,880
authentication contact class reference I

635
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,670
don't know why there's two season here

636
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
but it's a CR and authentication method

637
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:21,820
reference so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it</font>

638
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,610
stands for and so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is important</font>

639
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:28,770
because only the opie knows how the

640
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:31,159
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> was authenticated the convention</font>

641
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:36,110
this is sort of a best practice

642
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:39,350
to use the URI as the identifier the you

643
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:42,379
could use a string here like let's just

644
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">say duo or password but the problem is</font>

645
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,010
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose do or whose password is</font>

646
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,020
this you know is this password as

647
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,790
defined by bank of america or password

648
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:55,310
is defined by you know XYZ<font color="#E5E5E5"> com so the so</font>

649
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:58,280
using the URL gives you more context

650
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,250
about whose policy is this some people

651
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">would say use your ends or oids I find</font>

652
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,540
people don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your ends</font>

653
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,260
are and oh I DS if you like something

654
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:12,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 dot one dot for dot 7232 then use</font>

655
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:14,780
your OS there also though globally

656
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,820
should be globally unique so if you ever

657
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,470
do a merger with<font color="#E5E5E5"> another company you</font>

658
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:23,750
won't both have an AC are called

659
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:25,700
password so when you make a when the

660
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,460
client makes a request so you're either

661
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">a website or a mobile application the</font>

662
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,940
client can request a certain type of

663
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:38,210
authentication so the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say I'd</font>

664
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:43,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TV give me TV authentication</font>

665
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:45,200
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it's very hard it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

666
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:47,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not hard it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to have</font>

667
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,080
one authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology that's</font>

668
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:55,730
going to work in every situation so if

669
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:58,100
you have a for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a phone there's</font>

670
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,720
no USB input on that so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no point</font>

671
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,699
that you're ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to use</font>

672
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,280
that USB so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation that</font>

673
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,770
the if you're in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a door and the</font>

674
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,210
door reader has an NFC reader the door

675
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,190
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I need to use NFC</font>

676
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,070
authentication so the type of

677
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:15,230
authentication has to adjust to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type</font>

678
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:18,590
of device the person has in their hands

679
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and companies can't just support one</font>

680
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,490
type of authentication there's no one

681
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,290
workflow for authentication that's going

682
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:27,650
to work for every device and every

683
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:31,340
configuration this is discovery actually

684
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:34,430
I got it wrong so discovering the opie

685
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,649
the provider can advertise publicly what

686
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,430
type of authentication is required how

687
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm doing bad</font>

688
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:45,310
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the client registers what</font>

689
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:49,070
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication it would like</font>

690
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:50,720
the request it can override its

691
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:56,060
preferences so a client can say I

692
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,210
support duo and password but give me but

693
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:02,270
in this case I'd like password and I'm

694
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,460
gonna have to fly here the ACR tells you

695
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:06,920
after the request happens what type of

696
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,720
authentication actually happened so the

697
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,360
client might say give me do or a

698
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,790
password the ID token would confirm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

699
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay duo is the type that actually</font>

700
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,680
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm if I got the</font>

701
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,590
five-minute warning so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

702
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,100
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast here and because we</font>

703
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:29,139
have to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust elevation so</font>

704
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:32,000
what happens if the client requests a a

705
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:37,100
resource let's say I let's say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font>

706
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website and I I use password and</font>

707
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,659
then I go to send ten thousand dollars

708
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,240
and the bank decides it needs something

709
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,880
better so when i call that when i

710
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,490
perform that other transaction i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

711
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,490
the ooma protocol basically it would

712
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:55,250
return a 403 unauthorized but that's not

713
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,890
helpful to me as a client what so what

714
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">uma does is it provides some extra info</font>

715
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:04,550
it says yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your 403 but if you provided</font>

716
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:10,820
this extra piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> info you we would</font>

717
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:13,340
allow you through so there is am yeah so

718
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,130
the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the response the</font>

719
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,230
403 you can say need info if you get

720
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this type of authentication and it uses</font>

721
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,750
the ACR jargon required ACR equals this

722
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,409
so the so there's and then the client

723
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">can basically take that ACR and go back</font>

724
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:34,179
to the open ID provider and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

725
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:37,219
need this type of authentication and

726
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:40,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we did really bad on time so I'm</font>

727
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:43,520
gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end I'm going to</font>

728
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">go all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to the conclusions one of</font>

729
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,239
the things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going to talk about is</font>

730
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:48,850
UDP Claire mentioned this in her talk

731
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,389
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

732
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:54,159
cause in IOT land all of my previous

733
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,730
conversation assumed that we were

734
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,370
talking about TCP and and it turns out

735
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,560
IOT devices don't have TCP they only

736
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,080
have UDP so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

737
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work that's going to go on is not to</font>

738
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,540
reinvent open ID connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> and uma that</font>

739
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:14,560
that basically stays the same but to

740
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:17,620
define new to bind them to new transport

741
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,790
mechanisms come to reuse to reuse those

742
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:24,970
protocols the chant is to quickly talk

743
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:29,140
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> new challenges you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Google is</font>

744
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,970
sort of running up sort of the gun

745
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,170
really on the cutting edge like Google

746
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:37,299
Docs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I could sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

747
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,400
delegate some type of authorization to a

748
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,980
person this is really what i think is

749
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,770
the cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge how do i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify that</font>

750
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,440
other person and manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own policies</font>

751
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:51,610
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of the</font>

752
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,530
new challenges that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so i guess</font>

753
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:57,100
that maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you like a quick</font>

754
00:35:53,530 --> 00:36:01,690
idea I probably went over to fast but I

755
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:03,790
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the idea is is don't use</font>

756
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,700
two-factor authentication unless you

757
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to based upon the transaction</font>

758
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:15,910
elevate to the trust level that that you

759
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:19,840
need try to centralize as much of your

760
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:22,029
authorization policy as possible them if

761
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,880
you push out your policy into the apps

762
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,850
if you have it the authorization policy

763
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard coded in your code it becomes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

764
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,589
hard to update so you have to wreak you

765
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:36,040
a the app because you have a new type of

766
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:38,410
authentication you then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

767
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,610
be stuck so so centralization is a good

768
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:45,160
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Federation because we have a</font>

769
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:48,460
really heterogeneous environment where

770
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:51,790
we have we have open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source apps we have</font>

771
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sass apps we have mobile apps we have</font>

772
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,990
cut you know we basically have such a

773
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,510
variety of apps that no top-down

774
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,520
approach to authentication and

775
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,410
authorization is going to work so we

776
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,349
need we need these Federation

777
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,368
standards in order to to make sure that

778
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:10,569
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-off thing you know</font>

779
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:16,750
applications which is never never going

780
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:19,660
to happen use a free open source which

781
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a p mentioned is not free but at</font>

782
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,640
least there's no the license there's no

783
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,990
right there's no cost to use the bits i

784
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,839
think Foss is really important because

785
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:31,000
it increases the<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engineers and</font>

786
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,578
can eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> it our total cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ownership</font>

787
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,049
one of the biggest cost has been there

788
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:37,089
just aren't enough people out there who

789
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:39,640
know this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the only way for us</font>

790
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to increase the supply is to make the</font>

791
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,819
software available to them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and</font>

792
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,680
you can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that by preferencing</font>

793
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:50,170
the use of free open-source in your

794
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,230
organization because that helps fund the

795
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,930
software for all those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who who</font>

796
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe their organization can't afford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

797
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:01,299
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's really important and it</font>

798
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:03,009
helps make by making the internet a

799
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:07,538
safer place I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all sort of</font>

800
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:15,670
collectively benefit so that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

801
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:17,470
thanks questions Claire thanks Mike so

802
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you were talking about</font>

803
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:24,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">uma user managed access what do you</font>

804
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is going to speed up or slow down</font>

805
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:34,270
or have any effect on its adoption well

806
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:38,129
so Emma was just when final<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was</font>

807
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:40,450
this past year at RSA security and

808
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,430
personally so that's a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

809
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:46,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">Illuma group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it doesn't agree on</font>

810
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:49,270
I know I my opinion is that tactically

811
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:53,020
organizations can use it to solve API

812
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:58,230
access management and then so I think

813
00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:02,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it used in lieu of</font>

814
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:05,260
proprietary web access management

815
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:09,420
technologies and that over time will see

816
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,420
that it can't expand to other use cases

817
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:22,030
the questions okay well thanks here I'm

818
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,400
sorry you know anyone using humor like a

819
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,430
big player I don't know open ID connect

820
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,670
seems to be in facebook already Google

821
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:34,828
etc how about humor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm trying to</font>

822
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:40,589
implement at least early<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well so the</font>

823
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ummah was developed by Ford rock Oracle</font>

824
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:47,320
glue RSA so there's already a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

825
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,300
commercial implementations glue glue has

826
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:54,480
it in production and big customers like

827
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:58,450
Toshiba and and many others though so

828
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,490
yeah open ID connect is used by Google

829
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,740
for Google authentication and Microsoft

830
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:06,160
Azure Active Directory so it's it's it's

831
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,770
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of magnitude more adoption but</font>

832
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,759
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know if your choice is</font>

833
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:16,150
using some proprietary API protocol or

834
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,400
API gateway for API access management

835
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,099
and some open standards by using an open

836
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,460
standards it gives you some options so I

837
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:28,390
would look at it less of you know is

838
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:30,430
google using it and more of can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

839
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,740
tactically within my organization in

840
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,549
Luke's on proprietary API that I might

841
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,549
have otherwise used

842
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,070
okay all right just go outside thank you
