00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,720
thank you hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody I appreciate you</font>

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,250
hanging in there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last talk of</font>

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,579
the day I know it's tiring so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try</font>

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make it interesting so a few words</font>

5
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:37,600
about myself I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the security</font>

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,670
space for a long long long time over 20

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,129
years now<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big part of it in</font>

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,110
application security today I'm with

9
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:46,720
synopsis which is a company that

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,859
acquired Coverity and seeker which was

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,469
my company and code nomicon which is a

12
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:55,390
company that discovered heartbleed and

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,949
if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know more we have a booth</font>

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,129
and all that stuff I don't want to spend

15
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:02,649
time on that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacker and pen</font>

16
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,690
tester at heart but over the recent

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:07,570
years I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing a lot more work at</font>

18
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,729
the higher levels working on building

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,029
the right processes for security helping

20
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:15,970
organizations was integrating security

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,580
into the agile world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why you're</font>

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hear this talk and seeker my</font>

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,250
product was acquired is very focused on

24
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,530
helping organizations with agile so it's

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's not a product pitch I'm trying</font>

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,670
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard not to make it product pitch</font>

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,140
but just for a disclosure the cases I'm

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,750
talking about are using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,299
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to stay away from the</font>

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,939
commercial side as much as possible I'm

31
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,860
also a photographer which I usually

32
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,350
prefer talking about but apparently it's

33
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the right material for last con so I</font>

34
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,460
just put the closest thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could do to</font>

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:54,159
agile<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my last trip to South Africa</font>

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:55,658
so so I'll just go really quickly over

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,759
that I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like a bunch of</font>

38
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,079
talks about agile and security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,060
don't want to spend too much time on the

40
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,110
problem but just to make sure we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,350
the same page the main problems was

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,899
agile right is that it's fast it's fast

43
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,090
it's short cycles and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

44
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,489
lot of the things that used to kind of

45
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,489
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us in the non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Agilent world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

46
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,230
saying kind of because we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

47
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,880
security and development has not really

48
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,000
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for everybody for anybody</font>

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever but even the stuff that was kind of</font>

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,019
working does not really work when you

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,730
have cycles that are three weeks long or

52
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,519
one hour long which

53
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,950
we see more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more off there's too</font>

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,349
much data all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools that find</font>

55
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,649
vulnerabilities and help you automate

56
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,420
things tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> generate too much data</font>

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,150
which makes it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to sift through</font>

58
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,000
in a very short time it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

59
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,470
prioritize risk with developers that

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
don't necessarily understand anything

61
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,790
about security and so all this makes all

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,879
those big problems that we see terrible

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">and agile and I remember using using to</font>

64
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,530
read stuff that says well we'll build a

65
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,349
side process to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agile development</font>

66
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,810
that's slower so the developers can work

67
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,250
and then after we already deployed our

68
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,190
products will find the vulnerabilities

69
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,680
and fix them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty dangerous</font>

70
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,910
approach is you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">with high-level vulnerabilities so what</font>

72
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,329
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this talk today I'm</font>

73
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,709
not going to talk about best practices

74
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm not going to talk about all the

75
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:31,510
problems I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take three</font>

76
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,970
customers that we helped build an agile

77
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,560
process and just see what we did with

78
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,840
them what were the challenges where the

79
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,340
problems and those are real world cases

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,220
I wouldn't say they're perfect but

81
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,209
they're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font>

82
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,790
a good start so you'll see me repeating

83
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,239
that throughout all the cases everything

84
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,459
is around automation right with agile

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,160
security with agile anything really

86
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,530
everything's around automation we need

87
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a process and technology that</font>

88
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be automated continues and practical</font>

89
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,578
and the practical but is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important</font>

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,589
and I go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

91
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,419
through the cases out we'll come back to

92
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,978
this automation is the key for

93
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:21,010
everything so case<font color="#E5E5E5"> one let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start so</font>

94
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance company transforming to agile</font>

95
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,949
and this is an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when</font>

96
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">people talk about agile we have all this</font>

97
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,919
wonderful concept of scrum and DevOps

98
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:35,800
and continues testing and full

99
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,169
automation but the reality is the only

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,930
very small chunk of the customers that I

101
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,870
meet are actually there the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customers are moving to agile trying</font>

103
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,689
to

104
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,449
be agile trying to do test automation

105
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:51,969
trying to do this and they're always

106
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:53,889
somewhere in between and when we came to

107
00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this customer they were before</font>

108
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:59,590
everything they said we are starting our

109
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,090
agile transformation we need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

110
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,330
we've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

111
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,789
development until today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we want</font>

112
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is start to build insecurity into</font>

113
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,930
our development as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to agile</font>

114
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,688
they brought the dev ops manager that

115
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,960
was driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and but you have to</font>

116
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:19,629
bear with us that will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,068
agile and full DevOps in place for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

118
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,500
next few years but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still want to</font>

119
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:25,569
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we're</font>

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">working with them since closely they're</font>

121
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving they're progressing but in fact</font>

122
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,849
they're still very far from being an

123
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,199
agile shop right there have some stuff

124
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's better than some stuff that's</font>

125
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:42,639
worse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that requires a process that's</font>

126
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:45,339
very dynamic so they have stuff that's

127
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,919
already fully see I that builds every

128
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,990
night they have stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't they</font>

129
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,080
have stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has full test automation</font>

130
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,839
for the most part they don't they still

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,300
do most of the QA manually that's the

132
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,930
reality and so we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate into</font>

133
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,199
that so some of the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

134
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,759
had obviously nobody in the development

135
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,240
ever knew anything about security

136
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,370
they've they they're a very immature

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,289
company and sense of not just agile but

138
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and development so they've</font>

139
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,938
never done any development training and

140
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,589
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

141
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,139
they didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be practical</font>

142
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:26,349
for them as I said very different agile

143
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,629
maturity levels very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little</font>

144
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,878
test automation even today two years

145
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,680
later we're looking at less than twenty

146
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,069
percent of what they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test its</font>

147
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,110
done with automated testing if you go to

148
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,669
a customer if you go to organization

149
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,830
that tells you that they have their

150
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:44,919
entire functionality covered by test

151
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,109
automation they're lying I have never

152
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,839
seen anybody you know the really good

153
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,269
ones get to seventy eighty percent

154
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:54,250
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always some part of legacy code</font>

155
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:56,330
some part of functionality that ended up

156
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,650
is it yeah we have everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> cover</font>

157
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,560
and then we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about</font>

158
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:05,479
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this yeah this we have a guide</font>

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,090
that tests once a week or whatever and

160
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,590
their security group was very small so

161
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,789
it's an insurance companies now the

162
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,500
giant insurance company it's a

163
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:14,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">medium-sized insurance company their</font>

164
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,289
security team was<font color="#E5E5E5"> four people mostly</font>

165
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,969
dealing with firewalls and policy stuff

166
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:22,120
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have anybody work</font>

167
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:24,620
closely with R&D and of course

168
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,509
regulatory requirements and of course

169
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,490
they have all the technology the war in

170
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:33,319
the world like every big financial

171
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:35,120
institute um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and and the first</font>

172
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,030
thing and this very important when you

173
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,340
want to go and help build agile security

174
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,318
it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process before the</font>

175
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,878
technology we need the supporting

176
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,370
technology but we need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right process</font>

177
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,379
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them build a process and the</font>

178
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,560
first part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this process and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

179
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:54,229
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> true is get the R&D on board so</font>

180
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,789
the thing was in the past right we would

181
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,710
have developers writing code and

182
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,659
security coming and disturbing them at

183
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,969
some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> right oh no now we have to</font>

184
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,979
test that and will block you and will

185
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:07,190
disturb you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process doesn't work in</font>

186
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:10,128
three weeks cycles the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

187
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,919
can do security in code are the

188
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:15,289
developers and the only way to make a

189
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:19,339
process like this work is by getting

190
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:22,190
someone from<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rmd taking</font>

191
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:24,199
ownership over security every time and

192
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,849
trust me I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen them they're not in</font>

193
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,879
here because they're bad case studies

194
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:31,279
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we see somebody where the</font>

195
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">security guy is responsible for the</font>

196
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,179
security in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps it fails it needs</font>

197
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,029
to be someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> from their side their side</font>

198
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:45,260
right and so in here we had a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

199
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:48,019
candidate the dev ops manager was is a

200
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,019
very talented lady and she saw the

201
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,600
importance of security and she took

202
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,040
ownership of this and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she created a</font>

203
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,079
very good working relationship with

204
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,670
security security were there to guide

205
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,800
what they want what they need in terms

206
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,899
of risk and management but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

207
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">day-to-day is managed by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps and</font>

208
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:08,540
that's very crucial the other thing to

209
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:09,889
make the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel</font>

210
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

211
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:15,139
something that security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being taken</font>

212
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:17,509
from them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that security needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

213
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,119
in the process they need to feel they

214
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,619
have visibility historically security

215
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:24,769
people don't know what developers are

216
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:26,629
doing at all so in this case they

217
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,790
actually said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give all the</font>

218
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:30,649
security people access to our bug

219
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,849
tracking system because everything goes

220
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,029
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Braga tracking system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

221
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,089
about it in a second and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

222
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,999
use it they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it but they know</font>

223
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can and that gives them assurance</font>

224
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:46,939
that nobody's trying to hide<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

225
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,350
from them or cheat them or whatever the

226
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:51,079
other thing that they wanted because

227
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:54,379
they're slow slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> anjel right they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

228
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:56,628
release every hour and so on they wanted

229
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:59,540
approve of committees so there's a

230
00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:01,220
committee for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's devops guys</font>

231
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,829
and the security guys they get a pdf

232
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,109
report not the bug tracking stuff that

233
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:08,689
says this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lead of</font>

234
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:10,879
the application from the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> test can</font>

235
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:12,769
we go live or not there's a clear policy

236
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,019
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> going live or not but there's</font>

237
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,549
still a committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> that approves that</font>

238
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:19,339
sometimes it would commit they would

239
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:22,429
approve going live despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

240
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:24,860
vulnerability and so on again give

241
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:28,488
security a very comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling</font>

242
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,249
about the process being run by R&D there

243
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:32,779
about 15 systems so whoever needs to go

244
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,569
live is brought up to the committee not

245
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:39,319
all 15 just the ones that are want to go

246
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:40,579
live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next version and we did</font>

247
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the training if you remember it</font>

248
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,089
said they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want our indie training</font>

249
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,489
the reason we did are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> training is</font>

250
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,889
was very basic training it was basically

251
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:51,319
awareness training why awareness

252
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,389
training just to get the R&D people to

253
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:55,189
understand what the heck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

254
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,259
here why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we getting those new bugs</font>

255
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:00,860
in our systems why is all this happening

256
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:02,539
and it's been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it was just two</font>

257
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,939
hours three hour training<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think for</font>

258
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:06,919
each developer just what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

259
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,379
security what sequel injection a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

260
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:13,730
them didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that and what's</font>

261
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:15,709
this new product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we brought in next</font>

262
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,230
thing was creating the right risk policy

263
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,329
so that's important a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these tools</font>

264
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,059
are a lot of all the tools we do right

265
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a basic standard of risk</font>

266
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:29,509
sequel injection is high or critical or

267
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:31,339
whatever whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is low it's not</font>

268
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,989
always the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each organization</font>

269
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,419
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance when we came to this</font>

270
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:37,309
organization we have if if you have

271
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:39,259
passed a sensitive data stored in

272
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:41,569
browser cache right they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

273
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:44,119
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache flag for us it's usually low</font>

274
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:47,929
or medium for this it's a regulatory

275
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:49,549
thing it had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be high so we helped</font>

276
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:51,799
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a new policy they're not</font>

277
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:54,108
using an OS top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 policy but rather</font>

278
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,228
their own policy to determine what slow

279
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:59,719
what's hi what's important and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

280
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:01,669
before multiple output channels so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

281
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bug tracking system but it</font>

282
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:06,889
also goes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PDF report that</font>

283
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,738
security can consume it goes to various

284
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,949
places where every person feels

285
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:16,509
comfortable so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their CI</font>

286
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:19,189
DevOps environments they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins</font>

287
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,159
which is what most people have for their

288
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:25,868
built server and it pulls code from

289
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:28,549
their repositories builds this builds

290
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:30,439
the build deploys it to the test

291
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,999
environment this was a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

292
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:34,519
environment in the sense the test

293
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:36,709
environment was static the actual

294
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,159
servers that are used every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day the same</font>

295
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,598
servers for the testing go to my next

296
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,169
cases we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all dynamic</font>

297
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:48,829
servers which makes life a lot harder

298
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:50,629
they use HP QC for bug tracking they

299
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,569
used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some or they still have</font>

300
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:56,809
some static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis open source for</font>

301
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:59,478
quality not<font color="#E5E5E5"> security but unlike what</font>

302
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:02,059
they did with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it runs after every</font>

303
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:05,449
build but the results are not used as a

304
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:07,848
blocking decision for the build and the

305
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:10,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because open source static</font>

306
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:13,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis would create a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of noise and</font>

307
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:15,019
if it will block it would just be too

308
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:16,699
slow so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes into a separate</font>

309
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,679
channel where they sift through that and

310
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:22,339
open tickets from that based on what

311
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:25,848
they see is real as I said very very

312
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:28,069
very basic test automation and there was

313
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:29,839
manual QA so they're not doing very

314
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,819
short intervals there but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

315
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,849
projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are already agile are</font>

316
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,649
about 1 month cycles and then there's

317
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:38,139
manual q

318
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,529
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that was a challenge for us</font>

319
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:45,100
as an automatic tool and then what we do

320
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:48,009
with that so obviously we integrated to

321
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,589
work from CI so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time a build is</font>

322
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:53,920
finished after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the automation that</font>

323
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in place a launch of security test is</font>

324
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,899
done security test and the sea the way

325
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,939
our product works it will it likes to

326
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,249
learn from existing testing because it

327
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,540
sees really use cases so what we did to

328
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,550
enable that because they have very

329
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,300
limited automation is that we actually

330
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow to record the manual QA and put it</font>

331
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,498
into automation so we could replay

332
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,860
manual testing in an automated way and

333
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:22,540
then do the full testing and of course

334
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they are automated we would</font>

335
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,429
record daily so make sure that

336
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is covered run the test after</font>

337
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,869
each build and then they built a policy

338
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,429
into their Jenkins they would see the

339
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:35,949
results if there was anything that's

340
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,410
higher than high right higher critical

341
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,929
that would break the build because in

342
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,959
the policy higher higher means you can't

343
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:46,360
go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> production later everything</font>

344
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,008
medium for them was fine they said we

345
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to block the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjunct process</font>

346
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,029
for medium level in their abilities if

347
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,699
we get stuff that's medium you still

348
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:57,879
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it but it can be done in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

349
00:14:54,699 --> 00:15:00,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">next cycle again we have other customers</font>

350
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:02,589
that break and meet you so the Jenkins

351
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,470
breaks and high the script is built<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

352
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:07,149
that whenever there's wrote hi it you

353
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,360
get this red<font color="#E5E5E5"> little icon I show you in a</font>

354
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:12,399
second then all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> findings are pushed</font>

355
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,040
to the back tracking system<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their</font>

357
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,748
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open this blocker because it</font>

358
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:21,790
breaks the build and a PDF report is

359
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:26,649
generated and sent to security so they

360
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:29,949
can audit the test so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it</font>

361
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks I had to put gray boxes and stuff</font>

362
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,579
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would give the customer name but</font>

363
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,189
essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see there's a</font>

364
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,888
different systems run in<font color="#CCCCCC"> different times</font>

365
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:41,709
those are all the project right this

366
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,329
one's broken because it has a lot of

367
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:45,849
vulnerabilities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause it to break</font>

368
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:47,378
the rest are green and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get this</font>

369
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,609
dashboard you can see

370
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,639
any given<font color="#E5E5E5"> time what's the problem</font>

371
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:53,679
whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I build breaks all the bugs</font>

372
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,160
including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level bugs are being</font>

373
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,988
pushed to the ticketing system next day

374
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,519
the developer comes fixes those because

375
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:02,919
they're blockers or the highest priority

376
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they consume so they consume the</font>

security bugs together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font>

automation finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all funnels to the</font>

fix and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next day hopefully it's</font>

382
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:19,179
good see this this bill tends to break a

383
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:25,539
lot because somebody here is doing a lot

384
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:27,879
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ulnar abilities questions okay you</font>

385
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:30,129
can keep questions to the end so that

386
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:34,409
was the first case probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least</font>

387
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:38,319
mature customer we had in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of agile</font>

388
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:41,199
this one UK retailers actually one of

389
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:44,738
the more mature customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen this</font>

390
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:48,399
one was the most textbook agile customer

391
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:50,109
we ever had UK retailer in case you

392
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,589
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know retailers are the best</font>

393
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:55,449
adopters of agile in the world whenever

394
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:58,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">you talk to retailers they tell you if</font>

395
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:00,789
we're not agile amazon kills us amazon

396
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">is moving very fast they're very agile</font>

397
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:08,230
and so all the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the retailers are</font>

398
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:10,628
driven<font color="#CCCCCC"> by this so this was a pretty</font>

399
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,730
simple case it's a single platform it

400
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:14,829
has flavors it's a retailer that has

401
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,419
different brands so it has flavors but

402
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,658
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the same application</font>

403
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:22,809
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's run-of-the-mill agile shop</font>

scrum methodology<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-week long</font>

405
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:27,428
Sprint's very strict enforcement which I

406
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,320
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very impressed when they got there</font>

407
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:32,110
what do I mean by strict enforcement of

408
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sprint's if a feature is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done if it</font>

410
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:40,090
three weeks over its out it has to wait

411
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:46,418
another three weeks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in very very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">strict what if there's a new version</font>

416
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,669
don't push two days to fix this now

418
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:06,789
it's not common that's the methodology I

419
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,190
have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the customers i see</font>

fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> their leather like super rigid the</font>

423
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:21,309
couldn't fix it over the weekend it's

424
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:24,700
out good and and we took that and use

425
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,220
that for security as well so very strong

426
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,019
automation they had again not everything

427
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,029
but they had really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good coverage in</font>

428
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:34,809
terms of automation which was fun to

429
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:36,999
work with they had very very very low

430
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,279
maturity in terms of security quite

431
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:42,159
surprising for a retailer of their size

432
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:45,429
the european-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say generally</font>

433
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:48,580
Security's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little later to Europe</font>

434
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:51,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> few years ago already they were</font>

435
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,220
hacked and we came<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and apparently</font>

436
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:58,659
they were doing once a year a pen test

437
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,399
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so great company and so as we</font>

438
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:03,039
put our product there we found like

439
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:04,600
bunch of problems and all kinds of

440
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't expect to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find it a</font>

441
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:12,459
retailer at this size and had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

442
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,070
limited security resources knowledge

443
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,830
their whole security department was two

444
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,710
or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and that included</font>

445
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,299
physical security for some of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

446
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,859
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had like a big</font>

447
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,359
warehouse that they were they didn't

448
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:27,489
have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of physical stores but they</font>

449
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,590
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of warehouses so there's</font>

450
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:32,799
three people the head of<font color="#CCCCCC"> security came</font>

451
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,629
from the police was very physical focus

452
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,929
than a couple of information security

453
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:39,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">specialists they had absolutely no clue</font>

454
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,769
how to tackle all this they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

455
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:44,320
you know bring pen testers once in a

456
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,539
while and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they didn't find</font>

457
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,090
in their reports seriously we found like

458
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:54,249
easy cross-site scripting which you'd

459
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:58,809
expect a pen tester to find so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

460
00:19:54,249 --> 00:20:00,609
a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting case so again</font>

461
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,710
the good thing about this and whites

462
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:05,289
again on this board is because the

463
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">process was driven by the R&D it wasn't</font>

464
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">even driven by security security</font>

465
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,248
initiated that we had an incident but

466
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,059
then a guy from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> R&D took ownership</font>

467
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:16,590
of this

468
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:19,120
we have to do this inside our Andy and

469
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,980
security were just yeah we want to

470
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,600
supervise didn't even know what what

471
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,990
they want to supervise so we we just

472
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">created for them the right framework so</font>

473
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,440
we created a security work full they

474
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:31,658
were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different they wanted</font>

475
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,149
to say we we're not going to test for

476
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:36,789
security every build or every night is

477
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:38,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">their their platform pretty big and in</font>

478
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:40,840
terms of time and performance that was

479
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,379
an issue for them said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll test for</font>

480
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,889
security weekly once a week and

481
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:50,889
essentially in week 1 and week 2 they

482
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:54,879
find vulnerabilities and ideally find

483
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:57,100
that they're fixed in week 3 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixes</font>

484
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,299
everything has to be fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally and</font>

485
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,830
that's how they worked the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first few</font>

486
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,940
weeks were new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week was</font>

487
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:06,759
just about fixing out of the sprint and

488
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,480
in week 3 everything that was breaking

489
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:12,759
build was supposed to be fixed and as I

490
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,659
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strict they apply the same</font>

491
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:19,960
principle on of security on their system

492
00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:23,289
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wasn't fixed for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

493
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,570
last test on Sunday before the build has

494
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,970
to go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday this feature is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

495
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of a security vulnerability it</font>

496
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,249
will now have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait until the next</font>

497
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">sprint and they're enforcing it pretty</font>

498
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:39,249
strictly and I'm pretty impressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

499
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:41,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">it again weekly reports in PDF for the</font>

501

place didn't want access to the bug

502
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,289
tracking system that was too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for</font>

503
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,590
them they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

504
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:54,149
so they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a report i share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

505
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:57,759
report in a minute again they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

506
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:59,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">jenkins for CI they had grf for</font>

507
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:04,210
backtracking which is extremely popular

508
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:06,369
today the nice thing about them or

509
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,950
chalant not yet challenging for us

510
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:11,709
initially it was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer that</font>

511
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,779
we saw in the real world doing it they

512
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,580
have all their testing environment in

513
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,610
the cloud in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon which makes a lot of</font>

514
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,559
sense but it's all orchestrated

515
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,689
dynamically every day they don't

516
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,369
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a test server and Amazon</font>

517
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,580
that they use they create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

518
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:27,800
every day ever

519
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,330
thing was scripted so there's a script

520
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates a server a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scripts that</font>

521
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">initializes it a script that uploads</font>

522
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,860
their latest build uploads their

523
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,200
database uploaded smoke mock the data to

524
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,679
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database and so on and so on and so</font>

525
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,910
on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a challenge back</font>

526
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,110
then our product required some

527
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:51,710
installation and so on and we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

528
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:55,699
that so we give the next slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

529
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:59,300
everything automatically deployed tested

530
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:04,430
with selenium and of course daily

531
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:07,820
testing so what we did was first of all

532
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,590
based on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> request we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help them well</font>

533
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,990
they did that really they created a

534
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,850
separate environment for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

535
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,220
testing because they orchestrate

536
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,750
everything automatically they didn't

537
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to run on their normal</font>

538
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,530
orchestrated environment because that

539
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,330
was already fully booked<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

540
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,250
created every night it's working all

541
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,260
night long until the morning they

542
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,910
couldn't they could put security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

543
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there there was no time so they</font>

544
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:35,000
orchestrated a new set of servers that

545
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,180
would be security testing servers so

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,190
once a week another script runs creates

547
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:44,890
another instance of all these servers

548
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:48,590
one more to include our product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

549
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,870
it runs all the security tests now we

550
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,459
integrate with selenium so the

551
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,500
integration part with selenium is

552
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,270
running on their existing server so we

553
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,460
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> record all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that the</font>

554
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,950
selenium is generating so we can replay

555
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,550
that later for security testing now and

556
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:08,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that into the new environment</font>

557
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:10,520
and you know we run the test again the

558
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,379
results are returned to JIRA where is

559
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,750
the policy that breaks builds pretty

560
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,970
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody goes the same path we</font>

561
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,440
create this little HTML that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

562
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,810
view with gr edges the summary of

563
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,820
findings and PDF report that the

564
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:26,659
security can look at so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks</font>

565
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that that's the HTML</font>

566
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,890
results coming out of the product so

567
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,380
they can integrate to JIRA and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

568
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the daily reports so there's security</font>

569
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,880
people whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want they can go to</font>

570
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:39,320
this page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Co a test was run</font>

571
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,920
a test was run if they want they can

572
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,240
click it give them link to the PDF I

573
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,860
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they use it much but it's</font>

574
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,550
there it makes everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

575
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,590
comfortable that it's in process and the

576
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,480
security happens they still bring a pen

577
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,600
testing company i think they upgraded to

578
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,000
a better one our recommendation at once

579
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,139
a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they're in a much much much</font>

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,530
better space position right now for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

581
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm good with time good so case three</font>

582
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:15,470
ecommerce giant one of the largest

583
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:18,230
e-commerce players in the market so this

584
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,780
had a lot of other challenges so this

585
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,240
was our most mature customer in pretty

586
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,240
much every aspect they are maturing

587
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,760
security they do a lot of pen tests they

588
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,400
do the own<font color="#E5E5E5"> product static analysis their</font>

589
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,300
own dynamic analysis they do production

590
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing and they're also very deep in</font>

591
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,129
their agile transformation so they've

592
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:42,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing this for years they moved all</font>

593
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:45,950
their systems to a new infrastructure

594
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,310
built in an agile manner very advanced

595
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps in fact they develop their own</font>

596
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps environment their own private</font>

597
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,160
cloud their own elastic amazing all

598
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,100
internally they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do so</font>

599
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,330
they're a high big retailer as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

600
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine they don't want to depend on</font>

601
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:08,090
amazon for their cloud services so they

602
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed a lot of stuff in house which</font>

603
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:14,240
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive and very challenging</font>

604
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,980
and they really knew what they wanted to

605
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,380
do but at the same time they have

606
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,950
hundreds of people building this so

607
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,760
developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> devops QA and even though</font>

608
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,560
they do some security training security

609
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,620
training is very hard it's very very

610
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:33,200
hard for for keeping up people change

611
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,239
jobs every 18 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get new</font>

612
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,530
hires and they forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't</font>

613
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:41,420
care the reality so again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was</font>

614
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this word we came they had static</font>

615
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,550
analysis which was used in development

616
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,740
but static analysis as we know it

617
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:50,480
produces a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has to be</font>

618
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,340
worked with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's hard for some</font>

619
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,920
developers it requires specialized team

620
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,919
and they had stuff running in production

621
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,960
that would test things as they are

622
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:04,860
deployed already white hat right that

623
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,980
white hat in production and for them the

624
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,870
fact that stuff through all their

625
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,730
process the fact that sometimes white

626
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">hat still found vulnerabilities and</font>

627
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,680
stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to production that was a</font>

628
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,360
trigger said well if we you know we have

629
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,550
static analysis we have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

630
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet sometimes stuff goes to production</font>

631
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,010
with vulnerabilities that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unacceptable</font>

632
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,659
we can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're big retailer</font>

633
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,700
we can't afford any vulnerabilities in

634
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,310
their production<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when we came and</font>

635
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,020
all this process started<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a new</font>

636
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:38,280
your customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still in process but</font>

637
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:41,580
for them they criteria of success at the

638
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">end would be we never ever again find</font>

639
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything in production which is a strong</font>

640
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:51,480
criteria but it's a good place to hang

641
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">too again they completely understand</font>

642
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,340
that security cannot be involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,620
process and so they had to introduce

644
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,510
security automation to the QA and DevOps

645
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:06,479
which never dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to date it's</font>

646
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,820
a very big organization so the you know

647
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,640
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a their online site but it's</font>

648
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really made out of tons of small sites</font>

649
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,170
and applications and components<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

650
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,060
front-end and back-end and each of that

651
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,440
is a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and it's a big</font>

652
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,629
challenge right you write an automated

653
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,720
tool you want to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> tickets where do</font>

654
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,120
these tickets go to you don't want a

655
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,070
person now sorting through sand oh this

656
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,449
is this component goes to this team so

657
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a challenge getting all that</font>

658
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,360
done again automatically everything's

659
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,880
it's not automated breaks and fails

660
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,590
every time we try to build a shortcut

661
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,150
with the customer on something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font>

662
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,340
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to automate and say well</font>

663
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:47,550
there'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a guy looking at it once a</font>

664
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:51,000
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's not fully automated it</font>

665
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:53,310
will die it's how agile works because

666
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,820
even if the customer is a four weeks

667
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:58,679
long sprint which is fairly long it will

668
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,500
die and they will want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shorten it</font>

669
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,840
people that start seeing the benefits of

670
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,790
agile they shorten and shorten and

671
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,709
shortening the cycles and some of these

672
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font>

673
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:15,289
long Sprint's because it's great they

674
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:17,418
also had a very challenging dynamic

675
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:20,480
testing environment if in my last

676
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:22,340
example they had four servers that were

677
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,520
orchestrated automatically every day

678
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,918
here they also had orchestration but it

679
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,809
could be five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten or twenty that</font>

680
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,899
would create elastic servers based on

681
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:34,970
you know today we're testing really

682
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:36,709
testing hard the search component so

683
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,320
that will take a lot of resources so

684
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,760
let's load 10 search servers and put a

685
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,860
load balancer in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and all</font>

686
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,590
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great it dynamically and you have</font>

687
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,750
to integrate into that as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

688
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:52,789
homegrown DevOps of all the integrations

689
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:55,580
we had required adaptation but it's

690
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:58,549
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool customers oh so in terms of</font>

691
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,678
process again<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case whoever</font>

692
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:02,480
started the process was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

693
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,490
again they saw something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in production</font>

694
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,000
that was unacceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them said we</font>

695
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,850
need another layer at the DevOps level

696
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,919
but they got the DevOps on board it took

697
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,139
a while to get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board they were</font>

698
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,390
not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy in the beginning this was</font>

699
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,169
challenging in this organization but

700
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:23,270
eventually we were there we did a lot of

701
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:27,260
trainings but the training was on the

702
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,820
process not on security right we didn't

703
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,500
teach the DevOps what sequel injection

704
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,840
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crosses scripting and how to fix</font>

705
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,940
them we<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach the DevOps how to test</font>

706
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,889
every day what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do when you have a</font>

707
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:41,360
high or medium or things like that it's

708
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:44,570
all about process for them they wanted

709
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,689
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing every day as part of</font>

710
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,700
their testing so again very<font color="#E5E5E5"> elastic so</font>

711
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,200
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just they just slightly increase</font>

712
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,559
their environments to support more

713
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,789
testing and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> every night the full</font>

714
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,020
functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing runs then the full</font>

715
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:04,879
security testing runs and so on

716
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">preservation policy for them everything</font>

717
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,049
medium or higher is a blocker remember

718
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:14,600
that was the criteria and so they break

719
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,809
a lot of bills for security which is

720
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,809
good

721
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:23,639
and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the verification process</font>

722
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">if if it passes this process it goes in</font>

723
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,990
production and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's found by their</font>

724
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:34,440
production scanning which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now white</font>

725
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's we failed and again security</font>

726
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,520
group supervises they have access to

727
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:44,010
reports it's pretty common so as I said

728
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">they use JIRA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is the only standard</font>

729
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,750
thing they use which is about tracking

730
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:51,780
all their CI DevOps clouds internally

731
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:56,549
built we integrated that they create

732
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:59,490
builds<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day they create a cloud</font>

733
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:02,610
cloud private kind of environment as I

734
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:06,510
said it's elastic and they orchestrate

735
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,540
everything and they had what we called

736
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:12,510
hybrid automation so they use selenium

737
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:15,470
for all the front end stuff and it's not

738
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,460
even hybrid it's a multiple bridge and

739
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,590
hundreds of different types of

740
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,190
internally build scripts and tools for

741
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:28,830
testing all the api's all the back ends

742
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:30,900
and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as we came in we had to</font>

743
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,610
adapt again<font color="#E5E5E5"> our automatic installation</font>

744
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,530
scripts and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the previous</font>

745
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">retailer to support all their complex</font>

746
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:43,200
orchestration and did the full of CI

747
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,899
integration again everything it's very

748
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,340
similar everything that we did before

749
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,230
getting all the automation integrated so

750
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,490
whenever they have selenium scripts

751
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,440
running they're running through our

752
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:55,320
products so we can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> how normal</font>

753
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,299
usage of the application is done it

754
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:03,439
makes the security testing better than

755
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:03,440
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the pages by parameter</font>

756
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:09,889
and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I mentioned</font>

757
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole infrastructure</font>

758
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:15,120
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request that we could</font>

759
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:18,020
decide based on where in the code we

760
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,820
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerability based on</font>

761
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,850
basically servers types of servers and

762
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,129
classes where does it go to in terms of

763
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,350
opening the bugs so there was a one-time

764
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,290
project which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little nasty of</font>

765
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,020
mapping all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

766
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,879
but now whatever a new vulnerability is

767
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,610
introduced it's automatically assigned

768
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,010
to the right team and this is very

769
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,610
crucial because otherwise it gets lost

770
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,920
there another 12 14 different teams on

771
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,110
the systems that we're providing some

772
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,450
front and some back-end it has to open

773
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:54,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ticket</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the right team otherwise</font>

774
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,450
the tickets lost it's gone and and and

775
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,520
it's not possible to test each team

776
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,130
separately right because we're product

777
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,050
or test the entire application so you

778
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">always find things that maybe belong to</font>

779
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:15,409
another team so oh I even finished on

780
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:20,080
the original time so questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh wait</font>

781
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:20,080
where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the speaker right</font>

782
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:28,280
can you give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> some example of what</font>

783
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,290
kind of automation did you do you

784
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,900
mentioned several times if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

785
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,770
automation it's going to break so what

786
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,010
kind of automation did you do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

787
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:41,929
so test automation so everything is

788
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,600
tested automatically and then the

789
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,940
findings are pushed automatically to the

790
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,199
bug tracking system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision on</font>

791
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:53,810
whether build is good or bad is

792
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:56,629
automatic did they do static analysis

793
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:59,799
testing so some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the groups</font>

794
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:02,300
that you some of them did I mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

795
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,550
the thing with static analysis as I

796
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,580
mentioned and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's problem that</font>

797
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,740
still needs to be solved static analysis

798
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,790
tends to produce a lot of results<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

799
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,140
of data and the charging of that is

800
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:18,170
complicated one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

801
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,690
these customers picked our product was

802
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:24,680
because our product does the charging

803
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:26,330
automatically and so it's it produces

804
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,419
results that are much more consumable

805
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:32,930
without requiring human<font color="#CCCCCC"> intervention are</font>

806
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,850
you saying that static analysis is not

807
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,500
going to work well with the agile is

808
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:40,370
that what you're no I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

809
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,740
excited it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> require first of all</font>

810
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,670
depends on on products or different

811
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,089
products some of them

812
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:49,579
harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make work with agile than</font>

813
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:53,960
others it requires building the right

814
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:57,710
policy and the right rules to get rid of

815
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,589
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data the point is okay</font>

816
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,780
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis is focused on finding</font>

817
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:04,609
not just vulnerabilities but also bad

818
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,880
coding practices and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

819
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:11,270
poorly written and I'm all as a security

820
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,579
expert i'm all for fixing everything but

821
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,740
in reality the cost of fixing everything

822
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:18,859
or the time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix</font>

823
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,259
everything maybe too big for a very fast

824
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:23,240
process so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same if</font>

825
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,270
you want to use static analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> in agile</font>

826
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,490
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at the most</font>

827
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:30,589
important things that verified the

828
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level things and fix them as part</font>

829
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:34,730
of the process and the rest you push

830
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,920
into the backlog that can be fixed in

831
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:43,730
future versions and how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

832
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:46,579
dynamic testing you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a security</font>

833
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,829
team should not be involved so are you

834
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,710
teaching that group to do the dynamic

835
00:36:48,829 --> 00:36:53,990
testing or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen I think</font>

836
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,500
the product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use is doing the</font>

837
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:00,709
dynamic testing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that I will to</font>

838
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,990
teach QA people to do security tests it

839
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:06,349
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun concept it did not last very</font>

840
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:08,750
long I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can expect QA</font>

841
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:11,960
people to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security testing I think I</font>

842
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,329
think and and honestly if you look at a

843
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,609
girl you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even want QA people to do</font>

844
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:19,420
functionality testing anymore you want

845
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:25,520
scripts to do that you want automation

846
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:30,349
automated tools sorry yeah so QA<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

847
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">days as we move to yeah they they do</font>

848
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:37,730
less of actual testing and more writing

849
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:39,770
scripts the test and security people do

850
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,980
write the scripts to test for security

851
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:44,750
but again they can use products and I

852
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,549
don't want to pitch my product on this

853
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,480
stage because it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspen that's wrong</font>

854
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:52,130
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a lot of products</font>

855
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,900
into space that are focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on finding</font>

856
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,280
vulnerabilities in an automated manner

857
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

858
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:10,080
need it for this what a journey yeah

859
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:14,400
more questions thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for giving</font>

860
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:21,540
three examples set some involving early

861
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:25,530
stage and mature and like I dl a case so

862
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:29,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondered in these three different</font>

863
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases what it do you have different</font>

864
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:39,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">strategy when you start to engage with</font>

865
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the team like like for the early stage</font>

866
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:47,820
agile team whether you will going

867
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:52,140
immediately like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start oh</font>

868
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:56,900
you will wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like 10 to sprint and</font>

869
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:59,640
then start to going as security<font color="#E5E5E5"> expert I</font>

870
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,800
would say that realistically it would

871
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,850
usually take more than one to do sprints

872
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,350
anyway these things take time it's you

873
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,960
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start right away</font>

874
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,940
but it takes time it takes time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

875
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,240
the people on board it takes time to

876
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,580
show them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it gives them value i</font>

877
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,520
would say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with organizations where</font>

878
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:23,220
the agile maturity is low a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

879
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,590
we start with a much more manual process

880
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,020
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that somebody is actually</font>

881
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,330
clicking through the UI to start the

882
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,340
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do the test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and review the</font>

883
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,460
results and then click another button to

884
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:38,340
push them to a bug tracking system

885
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:41,400
because they're not mature in in the

886
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,040
whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fully automated testing</font>

887
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,530
bug reporting and so on whereas when you

888
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,300
go to the more advanced customers they

889
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,430
don't even want to see the manual stuff

890
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,490
they even<font color="#CCCCCC"> like even before we set right</font>

891
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:56,069
we come to the POC and they say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> POC</font>

892
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,990
criteria is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it in automated</font>

893
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,910
they don't even that for them the

894
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,220
process is more important than actually

895
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,649
seeing how the product finds

896
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,810
vulnerabilities how accurate it is

897
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they understand that without it</font>

898
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,720
being fully automated

899
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:21,250
doesn't matter if it's good or bad cool

900
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:23,680
thank you more questions no but how long

901
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,900
typically for in your case studies to

902
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,270
kind of get a program started from start

903
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of not just the software</font>

904
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,538
installs with the culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and</font>

905
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:35,010
where it's returning values of the

906
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:38,950
business after you've said to them I

907
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:42,299
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between four or</font>

908
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:45,250
five months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a year it takes time and</font>

909
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:48,940
i would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had customers it</font>

910
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,920
takes them longer than a year so we

911
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,319
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of small companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

912
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,660
customers so it's hard for me to talk

913
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:58,119
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's faster with</font>

914
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,089
highly technical organizations you know

915
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,950
if you go to a tech company they are

916
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:05,859
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> more agile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're generally</font>

917
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,598
more agile as an organization so it

918
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:12,509
takes shorter than when you go to an

919
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,510
insurance company which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not so agile</font>

920
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,399
but then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for the retailer</font>

921
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:20,410
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it one side the last</font>

922
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,539
case they're very big but the same time

923
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:27,250
their tech group is very strong because

924
00:41:22,539 --> 00:41:29,410
they're so big and and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

925
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,569
they're a big organization in many ways

926
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:35,440
they were easier than an insurance

927
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:38,470
company that's much smaller it's a it's

928
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:44,980
a mix of size and technological

929
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:47,759
advancement good thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much I</font>

930
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,760
hope you enjoyed
