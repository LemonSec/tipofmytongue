00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,009
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone this talk is based off the</font>

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,160
talk i did in London<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a month back</font>

3
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:34,980
and this this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin that's</font>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,809
actually London and as mentioned my neck

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,910
yolo's are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> special phrase we use it</font>

6
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:45,070
our company so appropriate I live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Los</font>

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,709
Angeles has put this slide here just

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:51,330
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a jerk signal science is</font>

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,489
based there it's good living and i am

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a physical therapy aide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am closest</font>

11
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,430
to a web developer although after this

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,680
gig i might go into the next one and

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I love is actually software</font>

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,430
engineering and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these slides</font>

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,409
are based on right before the talk I

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,570
took a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation in Rome and</font>

17
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">London to see lots of through force</font>

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,610
travel photos no babies no family to

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,190
serve nice creatures um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anyway</font>

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">software engineering and I'm using this</font>

21
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,860
word a lot because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a good</font>

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,660
phrase for all of us to start using and

23
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,280
you know the definition might be you

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,899
know technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned with the</font>

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,260
design and<font color="#E5E5E5"> building the software which</font>

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,750
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little you know academic but what I</font>

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,580
mean by it is it's not necessarily

28
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,800
computer science you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fancy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> degree there's no</font>

30
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,100
requirement there it's not even

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,649
necessarily codeine you know it's it's

32
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,289
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us in that definition that</font>

33
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,680
goes around like product<font color="#E5E5E5"> management to</font>

34
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:57,900
security to QA to dev ops 2 operations

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,840
people everyone is writing building and

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,850
using or validating software so we're

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,400
all software engineers I think that's

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,769
actually even better than say like

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">DevOps or a developer programmer because</font>

40
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,360
it really is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just extremely inclusive</font>

41
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's writing software that</font>

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,090
everyone should be sir playing by the

43
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:21,159
same rules the talk in london which is a

44
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,050
very developer focused talk was really

45
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,138
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plea for developers to get</font>

46
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,220
interested in security it's just there's

47
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:31,770
not a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crossover and</font>

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,890
for this talk Mike Lee is to get you

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,580
guys if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not primarily developers</font>

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:43,130
is to get much more active involved in

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:47,330
how software is made and deployed and

52
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:50,430
how is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software industry doing and</font>

53
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,370
the next set of slides are a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:59,220
of abstract but in my mind it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

55
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:01,709
paint a picture of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us winning Jeff Moss</font>

56
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,680
I mean as punk rock sigas he founded Def

57
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,190
Con and black hat he's saying time's up

58
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,940
we we failed software liability is

59
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,609
coming that's huge for the guide<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up</font>

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">black hand Def Con st. Nick yep it's</font>

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually worse than this he actually he</font>

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,980
actually is promoting it saying things

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">will not get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better unless legislation</font>

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:27,209
is done followed up at the black hat

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,130
talk is Jennifer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Granick and this is the</font>

66
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,600
part that is near and dear to me my

67
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,450
background is startups and small

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,600
companies we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a really</font>

69
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,399
crappy job of doing it and small

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,980
companies and independent people are the

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,530
ones going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really take it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the head</font>

72
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:48,720
first so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solutions this</font>

73
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,820
this I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> these over like a month ago</font>

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,220
these are this I find this fascinating

75
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,959
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Treasury Department feels they</font>

76
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,799
know how to write software that they've

77
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,739
got the answer right these two guys got

78
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,070
the answer and you know there's nothing

79
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually wrong per se with immediately</font>

80
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,970
detected port stop hacking times in

81
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,880
their cars except where is that going

82
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,830
and it's a whole new new bottle worms it

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,440
can of worms like where is that data

84
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,299
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> our car companies even remotely</font>

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,590
prepared to handle that onslaught of

86
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:25,260
data doubt it and that be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who</font>

87
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,270
is coming from somewhere else but the

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,969
government ranking laughs and actually

89
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,010
clean up their own house so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

90
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,050
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and then need to make it</font>

91
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,349
more interesting a two-way street of

92
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,270
saying one

93
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,890
government saying oh yeah clean up your

94
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,560
act on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand well actually</font>

95
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,620
we're gonna hack your stuff this article

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,770
is doubly fascinating because it's news

97
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,810
free who's in you know the Financial

98
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,450
Times there's actually no news in it

99
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just saying how bad China</font>

100
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,520
and Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> arcs they use hackers to do</font>

101
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,800
bad things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's no</font>

102
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,549
circumstances a UK or USA government do

103
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,220
that right so it is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this whole</font>

104
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,080
sort of corruption of stuff so it's our

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,740
software companies our security company

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,560
is going to save us this came from Mudge

107
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,300
this is sadly not a public report but

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,260
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the DoD I asked him about it</font>

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,210
he responded and DOD data clearly shows

110
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,980
on average one third of vulnerabilities

111
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,299
and government systems is in the

112
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:32,050
security software itself that's not

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,300
terribly surprising one is two things of

114
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,670
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diversity of systems the</font>

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,070
government might have the number of

116
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,320
security software systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> install is</font>

117
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,620
actually much smaller so there's a

118
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,130
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one it has a much higher</font>

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:54,970
proportion um yeah that's a tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

120
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so um yeah it's not surprising</font>

121
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,840
another reason because security

122
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,400
companies at least historically have

123
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,429
been founded by people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,710
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking things breaking things</font>

125
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,840
and building things really different

126
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:13,270
cultural mindset so again this isn't

127
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,760
terribly surprising but again you know

128
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,250
here's an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it no offense to</font>

129
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,320
kaprisky but they had a really nasty one

130
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,240
but you know the good news is they

131
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,700
patched and pushed in a day that was

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,740
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has probably</font>

133
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,180
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

134
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,940
impressive they're able to turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

135
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,120
around that fast the more negative

136
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,320
example um developers at the London

137
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,060
conference you know they hear the word

138
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero day but they don't really quite</font>

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,060
know what it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's like you</font>

140
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,930
know here's a zero-day in 2015<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

141
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,910
called dot dot slash at sea password<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

142
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,190
whoa that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero-day it's like yeah</font>

143
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not some exotic mystery stuff and</font>

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security product and then</font>

145
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,990
it apprentice a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole ton of</font>

146
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,860

148
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,580
this one is it sort of especially

<font color="#E5E5E5">painful there's a conference going on</font>

Japan it's actually pretty hardcore<font color="#CCCCCC"> HP's</font>

151
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,860
pulling out and they spent over 1

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,479
million researching if they could go

154
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,639
that conference does not cost a million

155
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,070
dollars to run right but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is money</font>

156
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,050
getting sucked out of our industry going

157
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,949
somewhere what makes absolutely nothing

people that's not raising salaries so

164
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,710
this actually does affect all of us and

165

way things are trending what's going to

174
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:14,050
happen is it just slower bloated more

175
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,039
expensive let's secure and honestly a

176
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:20,020
lot less fun industry to be in when

177
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,240
surance gets their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands in if you love</font>

180
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,560
fun your job will quickly shift to

181
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:34,029
something a lot less interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

182
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,589
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened and a lot</font>

183
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,450
of it is you know hey the Internet's

184
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,900
still a new thing it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20</font>

185
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">years you know really for adoption it's</font>

186
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:46,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> new it's sort of caught a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

187
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,829
include us meaning people who write

188
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,349
programming languages people who write

189
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:52,680
compilers people who write websites call

190
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,910
all of us a little bit off guard and

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,920
before the thing that was kind of a cute

192
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,839
little desktop problem is now like a

193
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,769
major security thing and as if security

194
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,869
is just not

195
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:06,129
volt to most things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it's you</font>

196
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:07,660
can't see it just not valued and you

197
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:12,249
know it's been sort of a new thing and

198
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,079
this is a very antidotal but back of the

199
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:17,889
envelope is this is the ratio most

200
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:23,019
companies have hundred devs<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten ops one</font>

201
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:26,679
security person and you cannot hire out

202
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,149
of that if your plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a pair i got</font>

203
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,100
even a better slide to emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

204
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">you cannot hire out of this if your</font>

205
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,199
planet your company is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hire</font>

206
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">more security people you're you're in</font>

207
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">for trouble because I hear routinely</font>

208
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,949
companies a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money than you</font>

209
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:46,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah our goal this year is higher</font>

210
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:49,719
50 security engineers where you know

211
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,399
where they might do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they got</font>

212
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,299
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of money but that's that's not</font>

213
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:58,029
really a sustainable thing so what what

214
00:09:55,299 --> 00:10:00,129
what else is sort of wrong is and this

215
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:04,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">is sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we view software how it's</font>

216
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:07,329
built this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft agile sdlc and</font>

217
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,399
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in it but</font>

218
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:12,339
it's completely disconnected from how

219
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,949
anyone i know right software training

220
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,720
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the devs off to security</font>

221
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:20,019
camp once a years they know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

222
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,519
people just don't learn that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> um the</font>

223
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,860
part I like there's a bunch of some good

224
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,540
stuff in there most of which is really

225
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,879
applicable to a lotta different people

226
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,110
is deploy and then infinite response

227
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,799
imagine you're the CEO of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company like</font>

228
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:40,209
here's a security sdlc it's like good

229
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:41,470
camp build stuff deploy get breached I

230
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,508
mean that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it says</font>

231
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,549
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very and then you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

232
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:49,540
right then it's done all<font color="#E5E5E5"> done we got</font>

233
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:52,629
breach we're done sdlc complete at the

234
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time like you know the stuff in the</font>

00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,649
newspapers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys might know this it's</font>

security product failing at the easy

240
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:11,589
stuff right this is actually by our work

241
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,819
you translate this I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

242
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:18,609
language this is it this

00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:20,769
is a real special culinary gift it ends

244
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:24,819
with tortilla the whole thing's this

245
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:26,799
very special right uh as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

246
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:29,589
hire out of it so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

247
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,689
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficient maybe you can help</font>

248
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">out with tools but maybe need to</font>

249
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:36,309
distribute some of the tasks especially

250
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,069
the easy stuff there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really</font>

251
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,929
hard problems in security patching

252
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:43,959
sequel line cross-site scripting is not

253
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:47,350
one and that is a task<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font>

254
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:50,618
definitely be distributed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh's</font>

in this room or next door he<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

256
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:55,929
sort of project I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am the cavalry which</font>

257
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,600
is honestly saying for basically

258
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:00,329
internet of things no one else is going

259
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its people in this room</font>

260
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:06,519
my take on it is there's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

261
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,989
actually that's not true there's not

262
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,379
enough people even to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to</font>

263
00:12:07,989 --> 00:12:14,019
spread out and really this more for

264
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,209
developers but I did this in London

265
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,509
really we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cowboy it's not an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eye</font>

266
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:22,238
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wee it serve a team thing and</font>

267
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:25,539
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about what's going</font>

268
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:27,909
on here so rugged and so the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

269
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:29,829
all that before was maybe things we've

270
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:31,869
done before<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't working so well we got</font>

271
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,138
try some new stuff some real basics

272
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:39,129
stuff and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> rugged and this is</font>

273
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:41,739
not a term I coined is the word security

274
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,139
is a little damaged for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

275
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:45,850
and a lot of developers this completely

276
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,639
check out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they see stuff like</font>

277
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,929
this all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> long and it's like is this</font>

278
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,189
helping is this advertising generating

279
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:56,439
the right message for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people as</font>

280
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:57,819
generating sales sure but it's it's not

281
00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:00,789
really saying like hey let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make our</font>

282
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:02,409
stuff better it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very reactive</font>

283
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:04,149
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of people where</font>

284
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:08,739
security it's like yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> those guys</font>

285
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:11,139
always say no duh and hey I understand

286
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:13,779
why say no if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a hundred to 10</font>

287
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:16,329
to 1 ratio and your job is like

288
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:18,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">mission-critical like that's almost the</font>

289
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,399
only tool you have is just say no

290
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,989
because you're so<font color="#E5E5E5"> underwater so maybe</font>

291
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,539
it's an unfair comparison<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

292
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:26,630
security and rugged or the current stuff

293
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:30,710
that's being

294
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,420
tossed out but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

295
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,460
words been poisoned so try a different

296
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,579
word you know dynamic risk-based

297
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,220
continuous cross-team hopefully

298
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:44,150
appealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs who doesn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

299
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">rugged right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versus surf static point in</font>

300
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:51,230
time list based etc anyway the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real</font>

301
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,060
point of software is is my former boss

302
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,690
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've said this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

303
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,729
fantastic really<font color="#E5E5E5"> software development</font>

304
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,680
she thought as a cycle of continual

305
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,630
learning and improvement rather than a

306
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,469
progression from start to finish or as a

307
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:09,710
search for correctness<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says a lot</font>

308
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,920
that's how a real sdlc<font color="#E5E5E5"> should take into</font>

309
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,680
account it's this type of type of

310
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,530
thinking it's it's not one time release

311
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,890
it's a continual release software

312
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:25,160
engineering takes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it</font>

313
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is a team sport definitely</font>

314
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,630
building things together this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

315
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,510
our interesting outside space at our

316
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,970
office but what's great about a team

317
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,800
sport is it's all building things

318
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,310
together and what's great about security

319
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,650
is you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an adversary and that's</font>

320
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,319
an awesome tool to use to get people

321
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,050
engaged this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I think the Getty</font>

322
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Center in Los Angeles and these guys put</font>

323
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,640
like big metal rocks or rocks or metal

324
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:57,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know did boxing and stuff so</font>

325
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,150
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do to sort of get things</font>

326
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,910
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of back on track because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font>

327
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,939
don't I really fear legislation might

328
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:11,449
happen but<font color="#E5E5E5"> depend on how we do it will</font>

329
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:13,280
change and this will sound style matters

330
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:17,810
let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> how software is actually</font>

331
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,250
built and a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> glass stuff have</font>

332
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,109
done over the last year's on social

333
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,110
continuous deployment development and

334
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:29,840
I'd say I've been harshly successful in

335
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,390
those talks partially<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I focused</font>

336
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,150
just on the delivery piece and haven't

337
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,319
really taken an account security and

338
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,819
evidently taken account the engineering

339
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,220
is purely circle

340
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,610
system of getting stuff in and a lot of

341
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">times I did these talks people just</font>

342
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">threw up their arms like that's</font>

343
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,550
impossible we can't do it because the

344
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:55,819
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cycle wasn't really taken</font>

345
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:58,729
into account so um let's talk about so

346
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:02,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy he i think is i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

347
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,210
quite as title is um pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much runs</font>

348
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,770
bsd security 3 SB<font color="#CCCCCC"> is DITA security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

349
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,830
bumped<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this action that's making</font>

350
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:13,520
the talk previously as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow Collin</font>

351
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,250
that's that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last part makes</font>

352
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,810
much easier to find and fix bugs and

353
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,000
that style<font color="#E5E5E5"> conformance worse is</font>

354
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,199
monotonically<font color="#CCCCCC"> they asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him about thing</font>

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,680
goes oh you like that you should go

356
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,080
check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> my slide 8 in 2012 which is a</font>

357
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,630
fantastic if you take nothing out of

358
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,900
this talk please go track down this this

359
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,720
talk he sort of makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that most</font>

360
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,699
bugs are actually found sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ad hoc</font>

361
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,400
inspection it's not formal code reviews

362
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,540
and you'd go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the whole thing and</font>

363
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,459
he makes it a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font>

364
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,199
great points on how to do bug bounty

365
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,230
using crowdsourcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs and all this</font>

366
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,320
other stuff but way in the back he

367
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,750
chopped up the bsd source code into two

368
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,390
sides and basically they're just

369
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:59,990
formatted or not formatted just purely

370
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:02,510
stylistically stuff and goes security

371
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,459
bugs in the non stylish files are

372
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,640
present on average four times longer

373
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,670
before they are found<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fixed ugly code</font>

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,730
has more bugs would get less attention

375
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:16,880
that's a blockbuster that's the same

376
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,459
doing proofreading prevent accidents

377
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,900
like that's a pretty pretty significant

378
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:26,329
statement um this book also mais doing

379
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,189
it came up on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use this</font>

380
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,360
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> or seen it in their life a few</font>

381
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:36,530
people have read and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was reading it</font>

382
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,770
and as it's like wow wow this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

383
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,200
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to software you know be clear</font>

384
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,900
if you need to be weird be obscure

385
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,480
purely don't take shortcuts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cost</font>

386
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,060
of clarity avoid foreign languages me

387
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,809
don't do something random and prefer the

388
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,120
standard to the

389
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,100
be young writers will be drawn at every

390
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,689
turn toward e centricity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> language</font>

391
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,850
basically soon as the new language

392
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,499
version comes out it's a race for the

393
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,449
developers to go use all the new

394
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:06,769
features and toys and tools and stuff

395
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:09,799
like that so the example of this is like

396
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">heartbleed and I was I've looked at the</font>

397
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,559
openness before this<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened i looked</font>

398
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,809
at the codes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to do some</font>

399
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,330
programming is like oh my god i got even

400
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,970
know how to start and some absolutely

401
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,309
convinced that these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> were based</font>

402
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,610
on truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the code was unfriendly</font>

403
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:28,668
for people to inspect and lo and behold

404
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:31,399
if you look at a leaper ESL that the

405
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:33,379
first 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they basically said like</font>

406
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:37,100
first thing we did we reformat the

407
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:39,590
entire code base we so unfriendly we had

408
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:44,119
to redo it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this came out two days ago</font>

409
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:46,668
and it is a great great<font color="#E5E5E5"> article on all</font>

410
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,279
the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google did to sort of make</font>

411
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:51,409
open SSL work<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's their environment and</font>

412
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:54,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">its really just nuts and bolts how to</font>

413
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:56,179
make software it work well and the first

414
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,639
thing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention if all the stuff is</font>

415
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:03,139
wow we reformat it made documentation um

416
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:06,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you some an actual example of</font>

417
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:08,629
like why it matters<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit more why style</font>

418
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,460
and formatting matter this is sort of

419
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:15,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the canonical example of which I have</font>

420
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,799
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and personally done myself is hey</font>

421
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:21,769
you don't need braces super cool here's

422
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:30,769
your dip approve that<font color="#E5E5E5"> diff looks</font>

423
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:33,049
harmless this goes out oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh you know</font>

424
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,730
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem you've now just done a</font>

425
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,090
log and<font color="#E5E5E5"> done your critical thing every</font>

426
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,860
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have personally done this it's</font>

427
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,699
easy it's like you don't you don't do

428
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,699
any thinking on it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do other</font>

429
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,179
variations of it if you know one line

430
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,139
statements better but then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

431
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the diff becomes much uglier it's</font>

432
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:57,229
just harder to know it's just harder

433
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,320
visually for people to see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

434
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,929
on so again there's nothing wrong with

435
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,129
making rules in the language making

436
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,640
style just because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> wear it</font>

437
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font>

438
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,010
you get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> church this isn't</font>

439
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,930
Italy<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey and they hand out like little</font>

440
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:14,300
dresses and stuff and things to wrap

443
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:21,500
funny this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has a point and</font>

444
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,510
there's this whole sort of broken

445
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,030
windows theory of stuff like stuff

446
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,340
that's maintained actually sends a

447
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:31,100
signal that actually reduces other

448
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,290
problems things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look well</font>

449
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,820
maintained are kept up as maintain

450
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,790
things that look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap typically</font>

451
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,500
sort of atrophy even further and to

452
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,149
further make it more interesting this

453
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,700
guy came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how this is like turned the</font>

454
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:49,010
century stuff the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heinrich theory of</font>

455
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,510
sort of general accidents and again you

456
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">can sort of look into all this more but</font>

457
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,160
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you get rid of the little</font>

458
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:58,520
stuff you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> end up solving</font>

459
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,280
problems that are much more severe now

460
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,560
there's sort of lots of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues</font>

461
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,570
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sweeping the floor doesn't</font>

462
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,610
prevent people juggling chainsaws I mean

463
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,649
it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a correlation and severity</font>

464
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,250
of the accident but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think its software</font>

465
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:15,980
it actually makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense the more little</font>

466
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,020
stuff you can clear out the more you can

467
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on much more interesting things</font>

468
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of you guys has been in that</font>

469
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,710
many code reviews but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guarantee you</font>

470
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,260
the first 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes is people arguing</font>

471
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:33,500
over white space and variable naming

472
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:36,470
conventions and junk those making style

<font color="#CCCCCC">upfront</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lymon aided goes a</font>

474
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,990
long way on people focusing on really

475
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,430
important stuff so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results</font>

476
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about an indentation</font>

477
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:51,890
style rules faster code reviews more

478
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,160
code reviews smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks less merge</font>

479
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,650
conflicts it's a whole different topic

480
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,830
faster bug detection faster onboarding

481
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,990
for new people<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's super important to</font>

482
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,669
typically simpler code because a lot of

483
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,100
times complexity is sort of hidden by

484
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,200
compressing white space or sort of

485
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,929
compressing how the code is and it's

486
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,430
easier to read for everyone now you you

487
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,229
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you programming might not be your</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks familiar every time actually</font>

493
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,978
makes a difference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

494
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:31,559
into your build pipeline start blocking

on violations really get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

496
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,109
the engineers my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know your</font>

497
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:39,059
VPN probably interested in this

498
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:41,279
especially your slum like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4x</font>

499
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:43,889
improvement on detection ad-hoc stuff

500
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,869
they might be interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now the</font>

501
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:49,379
beauty of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is indentation by itself is</font>

502
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:51,928
cool but once you have that working you

503
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:55,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">can layer on the good stuff because</font>

504
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:58,139
actually turns out once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font>

505
00:22:55,379 --> 00:23:01,498
clear way of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of communicating code</font>

506
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:03,178
all the other stuff works better static

507
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:05,429
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> works better and by the way you</font>

508
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:07,499
are absolutely nuts if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not have</font>

00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:09,179
this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your build pipeline doesn't have</font>

510
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:12,059
to block sometimes they're little

511
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:14,669
expensive sons they're not but getting

512
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:16,999
this in and helping developers fix bugs

513
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:19,739
before they go into production

514
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:21,119
absolutely should be your job it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font>

515
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like hey it sounds awfully</font>

516
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:27,448
suspicious the QA hey prevent security

517
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,668
bugs who cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> right results work</font>

518
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:31,679
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter and the closer you can</font>

519
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:35,219
get the static analysis to developers

520
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,190
the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so great got stack</font>

521
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:40,440
analysis go layer on more good stuff add

522
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,839
security testing I'll enough game just

523
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,749
talking about gauntlet and beaming your

524
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:48,479
code this week but um start adding

525
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:50,309
security tests you have pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

526
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:53,190
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> codebase you got most of the</font>

527
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,719
junk removed start hitting up finding

528
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">out where you're not validating puts</font>

529
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:59,489
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't forget you got</font>

530
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:03,479
the home field advantage you can use

531
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:05,369
off-the-shelf too late but you know your

532
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:08,579
sight better than anyone else where the

533
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:10,948
inputs are you can write very fast

534
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests you found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sequel I</font>

535
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:16,019
before and someone's code it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take</font>

536
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,269
you what 23<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to write something</font>

537
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,770
that tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> that specific input so it</font>

538
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:23,420
never

539
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:25,010
happens again it's great and again this

540
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,620
isn't just for the software development

541
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,110
team basically even security people

542
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,270
write code I'm told right this is came

543
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,820
in today chef sent me a webinar this

544
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:37,730
morning actually static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis for the</font>

545
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,200
chef cookbooks<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right it's only this</font>

546
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">building the machine image that might be</font>

547
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,710
important to make sure you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

548
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,330
little but it's good stuff so it's

549
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,920
really for everyone that's why i made

550
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,800
about software engineering we're all

551
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,810
software engineering we all gotta start

552
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,820
leveling up our game and actually

553
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:57,919
production of code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part right</font>

554
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,689
there is something I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been missing</font>

555
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,640
saying it talks about continuous

556
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,530
deployment because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

557
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,330
people are like wow but the crap coming

558
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,860
from the engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> team is so bad like</font>

559
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not gonna let little bits come</font>

560
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,149
out it's like if you have whole thing of

561
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,520
like got good style get good static

562
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,280
analysis you know you you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your able</font>

563
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,200
to write security tools you gotta build

564
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:21,889
pipeline contains the climate doesn't

565
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,600
sound is scary anymore however this is

566
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,510
still sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think how most people</font>

567
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,929
view continuous deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh god</font>

568
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:33,560
please not the alien egg bonus<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

569
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:36,470
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that and I understand for</font>

570
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,179
many people in engineering and security

571
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,400
this is their idea where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plant which</font>

572
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like mmm big chunk of meat</font>

573
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,440
well cooked all the goodies but in

574
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,830
actuality you really want this it

575
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:55,070
doesn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> as tasty I admit but it's a</font>

576
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:57,620
lot easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage and the word</font>

577
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:00,740
continuous i understand it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

578
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,370
continuous integration but really

579
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,620
meaning fluid not meaning all the time

580
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,820
slightly different and world and then

581
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been sort of missing on</font>

582
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,899
continuous deployment and this is again

583
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,050
something that I really should work on a

584
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,690
training class for is how you write code

585
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,610
is a little different and it takes a

586
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,370
while for people to understand it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

587
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,199
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by this is let's say this is</font>

588
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,479
what's getting the point that's it

589
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,330
that's your diff it doesn't matter

590
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,070
what's on the inside and you see that

591
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">commits go out just one function right</font>

592
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:38,760
what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say about this deployment</font>

593
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:41,790
very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well I didn't see</font>

594
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,150
the test go with it I didn't say any it

595
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:48,180
super easy to QA now what your process

596
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,780
is internally is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but a very</font>

597
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:54,120
small change you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Bob you</font>

598
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,889
just pushed out something please fix it

599
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,590
you want a different flow that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

600
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,710
too but very small changes make it very

601
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,689
easy to see what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

602
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,320
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 page code reviews might have to</font>

603
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:10,020
occasion that's okay other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

604
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,909
do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the oh if you're making</font>

605
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,970
a big change just leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old stuff</font>

606
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,770
there just write a new function it makes

607
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,470
it easier in context to see the

608
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:23,670
differences and you can swap things on

609
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,680
and off very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a flag I could</font>

610
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:29,250
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for another hour on this but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

611
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,830
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> on 2010 and this guy really walks</font>

612
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,310
through a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tricks and how to</font>

613
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,199
enable continuous deployment it's a

614
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:41,220
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but again everyone's got</font>

615
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,660
different risk profiles you know if

616
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,660
you're primarily you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

617
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,000
webshop you might different code bases

618
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:51,450
of different segments like CSS going up

619
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,540
not so scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> um previous place i was at</font>

620
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,670
we could only deploy once a week because

621
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,409
that's all our customers could handle

622
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,460
like this it took so long<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

623
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:05,310
uncover problems is once a week at best

624
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:07,010
that's ok so the mechanism super

625
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,750
important are you able to deploy quickly

626
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,700
but what your policy is that really

627
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,470
depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own risk nothing wrong</font>

628
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but when you do it shouldn't</font>

629
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a big deal like you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

630
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:26,700
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy quickly it shouldn't be a big</font>

631
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:28,470
deal and this is why this Jeremiah phone

632
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,730
white hat average time to fix a

633
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,920
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred fifty days I've</font>

634
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,050
been reported that's not due to

635
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,940
technical problems and if you know a

636
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,909
white hat does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's frequently like</font>

637
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,100
sequel I across<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's gripping the basics</font>

638
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:43,500
150 days they cannot actually deploy a

639
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,719
fix out because the fix i guarantee you

640
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,050
I can see I can just see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixes or</font>

641
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,580
I oh yeah they didn't spit in parameter

642
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">chorea they didn't you know Escape</font>

643
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:56,669
something like the fix is 30 seconds

644
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:59,850
these can't get the code out right and

645
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:03,270
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't apply only just to as said</font>

646
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,129
we're all software engineers don't

647
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget the server this actually is in a</font>

648
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,170
some English newspaper telling ms for

649
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,690
people that make sure their smartphone

650
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:16,830
app is updated right now I was like wow

651
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:20,630
that's that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that applies</font>

652
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:23,179
the OS as well right for servers

653
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:27,300
stripping out junk you don't need and

654
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,860
being able to update patches I would

655
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,629
date security<font color="#E5E5E5"> badges fifty percent I</font>

656
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,169
don't know how true this is it's

657
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,430
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> true yeah security conferences</font>

658
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,300
security comments I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> see anyone</font>

659
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:42,180
talking about patch man ever right super

660
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,370
weird so continuous deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font>

661
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this funny thing that every other</font>

662
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,360
person sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not not my backyard</font>

663
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,810
problem like I want it but don't let

664
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,850
that guy have it security<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks love it</font>

665
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,370
when they need patches not so crazy

666
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,080
about regular deployment Ops guys

667
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,250
typically don't whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> any deployments</font>

668
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of something's going to break</font>

669
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're gonna be able to hook for it</font>

670
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,250
and developers love it but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

671
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,330
don't care about security and operation

672
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:11,850
so it's kind this funny thing where

673
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:15,810
everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants it so it work on it</font>

674
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,580
let's see so the last part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sort of</font>

675
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:21,540
talked about getting higher quality

676
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,929
stuff to to deployment get<font color="#CCCCCC"> anythings to</font>

677
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployed and so the last part is sort of</font>

678
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:32,430
like the runtime once it's live what

679
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,620
happens and again for security folks or

680
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,540
maybe understaffed under-resourced this

681
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,810
is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other piece that makes</font>

682
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,360
things possible like every engineering

683
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,120
organization in the world is trying to

684
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,250
go faster like there's no doubt about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

685
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,860
the number of velocity product

686
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,020
performance everyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do it</font>

687
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,080
and what sort of securities answer to

688
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,480
that like no go no<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do it like it's</font>

689
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,929
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a viable solution anymore especially</font>

690
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">since like</font>

691
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,400
the productivity of a single developer

692
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,000
has probably gone up<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100x in the last 10</font>

693
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">years right manner of libraries same of</font>

694
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,720
operations to operations definitely a

695
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,470
hundred x over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

696
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,900
stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do now is pretty amazing</font>

697
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,490
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to help security</font>

698
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,030
people be more comfortable at the rate

699
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:24,640
of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I take a sort of run time</font>

700
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,139
monitoring for security you know we're

701
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,650
really good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine level monitoring</font>

702
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,130
we might be good at a application<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

703
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,750
monitoring is your appt up or down more

704
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,790
advanced shops are good at code level

705
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,350
monitoring this are like the stats d

706
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,030
stuff for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start able to MIT</font>

707
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,240
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want from the application</font>

708
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,590
anytime but application security

709
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,870
monitoring in my mind these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sort of</font>

710
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:53,860
some key questions if you're doing a web

711
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:57,000
app what are the attacks where are they

712
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:00,129
attacking and are they being successful

713
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,770
now what's weird is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so hey I'm in</font>

714
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,620
this business<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor alert what's</font>

715
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,690
fascinating about this is when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

716
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,939
sales calls i talked to like large

717
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,340
customers this actually is an alien

718
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:16,330
concept to them it's like oh but that's

719
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,220
network security like oh really and it's

720
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,600
like now we're guys like no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

721
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,340
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not our problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

722
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,129
different thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you just step</font>

723
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,929
back from whatever your<font color="#E5E5E5"> businesses it's</font>

724
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:30,730
like that's a pretty natural thing to

725
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:32,910
ask right and what's important is it

726
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,320
closes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feedback loop to developers</font>

727
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:38,260
where are you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going through</font>

728
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">these questions no we just said like it</font>

729
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,800
takes hundred fifty days to close a

730
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,740
vulnerability like there's no sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

731
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">urgency so it's completely abstract is</font>

732
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone attacking eyes and when trying to</font>

733
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,880
exploit it what's happening where they

734
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,940
tax basically where are they attacking

735
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,010
that's someone's code someone wrote that

736
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">code like they're attacking your code</font>

737
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:02,110
it's a very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of empathetic</font>

738
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,490
response you'll see from developers it's

739
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,168
like yeah there's a bug in my code it's

740
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,509
like they are attacking your code

741
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,429
okay I'm responsible for totally

742
00:33:08,509 --> 00:33:11,899
different mindset and are they being

743
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,820
successful everyone's concerned about

744
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:16,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">that part but it's a really different</font>

745
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:20,119
view of your able to show what is

746
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,129
happening and where it changes the game

747
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:24,559
so you got higher quality stuff going in

748
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:26,629
you have smaller pieces going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we're</font>

749
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,799
able to see what's happening and then

750
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:32,869
loop it all the way back through so this

751
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a sort of like what there's always</font>

752
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:38,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bits and bobs false positives</font>

753
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:41,149
things happening just just the internet

754
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,539
right just that's that's the world we

755
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:47,359
live in now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does a cloud-based</font>

756
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:50,480
scanner look like fairly well behaved

757
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,879
actually any 20 requests I don't

758
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,789
remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> units the world of graphs</font>

759
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:57,918
right per minute for a second I camera

760
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:01,090
highly per minute well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll behave</font>

761
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and when someone in a you know</font>

762
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,619
country with strong economic incentives

763
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:11,059
to attack as many sites as possible it's

764
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:14,179
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> different right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2004 sex is this</font>

765
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:16,280
they probably curl bash sequel map they

766
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:19,040
type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your website right and that's</font>

767
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,899
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes you know that's all it</font>

768
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,980
takes we just saw like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zero day and</font>

769
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">fire I the hardest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

770
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,319
discovering that was probably installing

771
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,069
fire on in the first place right

772
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,869
seriously that's why it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took so long</font>

773
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:33,969
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one has access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the box</font>

774
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:36,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">they go sign some NDA or something right</font>

775
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,270
cool when you start digging in and

776
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:41,329
you're showing developers they're

777
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacking what code and where first of</font>

778
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:46,190
all most developers might not have ever

779
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,868
seen a sequel I attack I know it's like

780
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,569
what really it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

781
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:52,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and that's a nose go duke on my talk</font>

782
00:34:50,569 --> 00:34:53,839
is a little long-winded is a little like

783
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:56,359
yeah and they get to the point this

784
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,599
slide people like oh what's that like

785
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:02,690
they've never seen it before you know

786
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:07,160
it's a really different view of what's

787
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:08,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yeah and there's a whole bunch</font>

788
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other good stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do to you</font>

789
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,680
know like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things coming in</font>

790
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,450
through tor and malicious IPS is coming

791
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,399
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data center or an actual person</font>

792
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,379
you know it's all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very</font>

793
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,640
interesting people start getting really

794
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,290
interested

795
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,000
just and security but how is the website

796
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">working how is the thing they are</font>

797
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening bad inputs</font>

798
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:32,120
aren't an abstraction all sorts of weird

799
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:34,370
stuff going on all the time and so the

800
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,799
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all this is like with the</font>

801
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:40,160
runtime moderated one if something goes

802
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,190
out they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see if someone's picking up</font>

803
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,589
on it is the attack happening right away

804
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,600
as fast the developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> push code the</font>

805
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,550
security person can also see what's

806
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,319
actually being attacked and if so the

807
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,080
new code is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually being exploited or</font>

808
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,030
not and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my favorite picture</font>

809
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,370
actually this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of famous</font>

810
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,490
picture developers actually get

811
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:04,910
interested in security and it's like you

812
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:08,509
guys have so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to do you cannot</font>

813
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:10,279
be worried about hassling a developer to

814
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,870
fix their sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I code or the</font>

815
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,820
cross-site scripting code or these all

816
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,650
these other little knits and bits and

817
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,880
bobs that sort of take up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> enormous</font>

818
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,890
amount of time actually have security

819
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,630
consequences so you we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

820
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,450
hire out of it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to push</font>

821
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:33,560
the people writing the bugs to be

822
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:36,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible for the bugs right so what's</font>

823
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,650
rugged I don't know but I'm sorry we're

824
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend our I don't know but</font>

825
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:45,800
really if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of software's being</font>

826
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,780
written by a team huge win writing code

827
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,020
that's meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be read by the team and</font>

828
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,970
an ad if it's great get rid of filtering

829
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,620
out the dumb stuff so you have more

830
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,980
confidence in your engineering team

831
00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:00,859
super important deploying small chunks

832
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,660
regularly let me tell you like you can

833
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,520
just sit the deployment logs and see

834
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,310
stuff and you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

835
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,990
what every change is not every change is

836
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,509
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have security components to it</font>

837
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,259
and can get more advanced and say like

838
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:17,630
hey if it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading sort of</font>

839
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:20,900
stuff live you know you're getting post

840
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:22,100
requests if it's calling out doing a

841
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
shell command like you can actually

842
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,610
trigger that like well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh deploy just</font>

843
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,230
went out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just you know issued a</font>

844
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,530
shell command but you can go in there

845
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,910
take a look developer hey gotta fix this

846
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,490
stuff

847
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:36,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">ree push out you can do this almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

848
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,410
real time making security visible

849
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,730
there's two things I started talked

850
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,129
about development and how making

851
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,799
security visible to developer so they're

852
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,900
interested these little sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

853
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:49,150
of like the background noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's</font>

854
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also interesting</font>

855
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:56,319
that CEO and CFO because their idea of

856
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:58,599
security is basically the sdlc<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

857
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:00,190
presented we deploy code it gets

858
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,170
breached except they all know that last

859
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">part everything's fine everything's fine</font>

860
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,119
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss got a problem we got breached</font>

861
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,950
like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand that risk is</font>

862
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,990
a continuum they think everything's fine

863
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:14,379
until there's an accident<font color="#E5E5E5"> so actually</font>

864
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">building awareness a level up super</font>

865
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,690
important super important as well

866
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">where'd I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go here yeah yeah so watch</font>

867
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,770
what happens at the end the end of my

868
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,220
trip to Rome went to this restaurant and

869
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:29,200
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually on our menu which i'm</font>

870
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,689
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite sure what it means</font>

871
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,730
but there's a mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it haha I</font>

872
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:40,180
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect I'm sorry do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

873
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any strong opinions on language</font>

874
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,960
safety so like coding and rust is much

875
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:48,579
safer than coding drunk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> C but there's</font>

876
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,450
only 11 people in the world who can code

877
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:55,390
in rust which means yeah that's funny

878
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:59,259
you mentioned access and meaning to

879
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:02,740
write a topic on is an insurance-based

880
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:04,059
world what what wouldn't your premiums

881
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,950
look like assuming the insurance guy

882
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:07,720
doesn't do what they're doing what's the

883
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:12,819
mean time to failure in different

884
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:14,709
languages definitely some languages

885
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:16,839
appear to be safer than others i'm

886
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,200
actually very curious in the PHP talk

887
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:22,180
that's coming up next yeah because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

888
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious to see basically anything that</font>

889
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:28,450
touches<font color="#E5E5E5"> c code is will have a failure</font>

890
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,339
rate in it that will be severe what's

891
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,460
tricky about that as PHP is mostly

892
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:34,869
sea-based you don't program in it but

893
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,359
the vulnerabilities are all in c

894
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,920
occasionally you get logical problems

895
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,348
logical problems i'm fine with like

896
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,230
people make mistakes stuff happens

897
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:46,980
memory overflows

898
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,200
buffler pointer over in overflow uh it's

899
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,570
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the same story for 30 years</font>

900
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,270
maybe 40 years actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't see</font>

901
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:57,270
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thank You ed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something make</font>

902
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that me file about so yeah there</font>

903
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,330
isn't risk-adjusted return through

904
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,830
programming languages unfortunately most

905
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,560
security people don't have enough

906
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,799
influence to like band entire classes of

907
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the programming languages because if</font>

908
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,560
they did there would be some changes

909
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,850
very rapidly yeah companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that use</font>

910
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,070
continuous<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment force companies</font>

911
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,410
that don't and what the cost-benefit

912
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,210
analysis is and so I company does it do

913
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:25,200
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if it's caused a</font>

914
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,300
correlation much more successful that in

915
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,029
terms of general but also its stock

916
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,700
price and financial performance time to

917
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:34,320
market so we're looking at sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's</font>

918
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:38,879
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security and actually almost</font>

919
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,260
they tire I'd say two-thirds of the talk

920
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,270
was not security of software engineering

921
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just straight up how do you write code I</font>

922
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,790
think there's actually everyone wins

923
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:54,710
great well thanks everyone's never join

924
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,710
up I'll see I'm around anymore
