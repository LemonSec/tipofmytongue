22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,280
of some things that I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a</font>

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable yes I do love them I've been</font>

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,720

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved in in austin community in</font>

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,610
particular and as often mentioned i run

29
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,130
the security operations team and

30
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,750
advisory board so i have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been hands</font>

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,280
on keyboard for many years which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not giving a technical presentation</font>

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that I was any good at it when I was</font>

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the keyboard but largely i hack</font>

35
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,909
relationships and I have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,009
rather than technology so that's that's

37
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,240
what I'm here to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today so in</font>

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,979
terms of that let's make sure we're all

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the right same page as far as</font>

40
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,140
expectations go what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font>

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,929
of me is that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an expert in this</font>

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,790
field by a long stretch and I hope to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,369
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate that accurately to</font>

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,830
you i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am not an expert here this is not</font>

45
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,000
by all means clearly in 35-40 minutes

46
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,490
whatever they've given me there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be comprehensive and there's no</font>

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,869
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can do this without your</font>

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">participation so please please</font>

50
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,670
participate what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should expect of</font>

51
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:15,629
yourself out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic and hopefully</font>

52
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,030
during the during this session as well

53
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,920
is that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people out there</font>

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,140
that you have to work with or do work

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,018
with or enjoy working with but none of

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,339
them are all like you so we have to

57
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,959
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about what other people</font>

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,810
are like because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all like us</font>

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,520
and please be open as we go through

60
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,080
to some different ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that</font>

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may not have considered it before in</font>

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,470
terms of how you work with people and

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,720
what you consider in either your

64
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,630
existing position or future kind of

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,609
roles you want to fulfill what what you

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,810
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do differently then</font>

67
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,050
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and you have done in the</font>

68
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,340
past if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any me at all or if</font>

69
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,530
you've heard talks that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given in</font>

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,750
the past you know that I have a

71
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,209
particular emphasis or enjoyment of the

72
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,319
topic of leadership this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

73
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,730
favorite quotes about leadership so

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,170
collaboration communication is really

75
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,149
what I'm talking about today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,530
ultimately it's because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

77
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,290
in learning more about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

78
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,110
effective leader and communication is a

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,548
big part of what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is why</font>

80
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that now and have kind</font>

81
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,319
of rejiggered some of my talking

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,030
opportunities towards communication and

83
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,599
collaboration versus just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concept of</font>

84
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,920
leadership but in altum Utley what we

85
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,500
have to learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how to listen</font>

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,720
well for communication communication is

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,290
largely about<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening and not more not</font>

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,820
so much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you have to say</font>

89
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,560
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and leadership in</font>

90
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,299
particular are not about the role you

91
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,880
have so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about your job position</font>

92
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,320
or your title right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about what</font>

93
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think it's really about what you do</font>

94
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's not about you on your own or</font>

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,410
acting by yourself that's about how you

96
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,630
work with other people that's kind of

97
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,150
the source of leadership so what more<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

98
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,440
leadership is about is what the actions

99
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,850
are you taking what do you what are you

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,410
doing here not what are you thinking

101
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,358
about what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing how are you</font>

102
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,420
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative in your role in the</font>

103
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,250
office and or or outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the office</font>

104
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,619
and how do you how will you work with

105
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,019
other people my emphasis in leadership

106
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,359
both in talking at conferences like this

107
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,100
in working with my colleagues in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

108
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">office and in working with friends</font>

109
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,060
outside of the office is in finding

110
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,339
opportunities for all of us to lead

111
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,899
where we are right now not to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

112
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,060
that future position I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

113
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,710
leader when I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next job i'm</font>

114
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,120
gonna be a leader when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get elected</font>

115

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,320
leader in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have more</font>

117
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,389
wisdom and experience leadership isn't

118
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,789
it is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you are right now it's</font>

119
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can do today so keep that</font>

120
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,479
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we go here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my kind of</font>

121
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,930
overview we again so we'll start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

122
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,440
why why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we talking about this at all</font>

123
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,510
we all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

124
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,430
people whether we like it or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

125
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,099
our job done<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in security</font>

126
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,420
right I think everybody in the office

127
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,520
the stuff or everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the audience</font>

128
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,290
rather everybody in the audience can use

129
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,330
something of what I'm talking about

130
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">today none of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is exclusive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

131
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,150
particular job role or a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font>

132
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,330
function in any way we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talking</font>

133
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about even though you could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

134
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in a security role we're not</font>

135
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,090
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to coerce or mandate</font>

136
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,800
folks to do something but we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

137
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,640
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to influence them and guide</font>

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,010
them into making good decisions and

139
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,659
secure decisions in particular so the

140
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">way or the place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to begin with</font>

141
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason that that that I think</font>

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you can learn something here is</font>

143
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,000
because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and start</font>

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,480
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about intuition and about</font>

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,180
behavior so our own intuition the kind

146
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of human intuition process and then the</font>

147
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,070
behavior of ourselves and the behavioral

148
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,900
style of ourselves and other people so

149
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,520
start with intuition and in order to do

150
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,140
that I have a few quick tests you may

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,979
not have expected a pop quiz but well

152
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:54,640
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> all take the pop quiz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

153
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:58,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so here's the first question focus</font>

154
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:01,150
here think pop quiz<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much does the</font>

155
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,610
ball cost that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowl together is</font>

156
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,520
110 that is a dollar how much does a

157
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,440
ball cost right that's kind of the first

158
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to jump to mind and that's wrong</font>

159
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,250
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> cents if you do the math in your</font>

160
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,050
head one more time the math okay cost

161
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,280
five cents now here's the second one so

162
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,110
now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a hint that these are trick</font>

163
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,570
questions right five machines five

164
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,580
minutes five widgets what is a hundred

165
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,150
machines and 100 wizards<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

166
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,310
minutes right no five minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

167
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,049
intuition intuition games what's

168
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,760
happening here there's a patch of lily

169
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,540
pads in the lake that<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch doubles in</font>

170
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,520
size right it takes 40 every day 48 days

171
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,550
to cover the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> lake you guys are</font>

172
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,930
binary mathematicians right it's not 24

173
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:50,230
days it's 47 right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so intuition</font>

174
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,360
plays games with this intuition our fast

175
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,340
thinking mode is not necessarily

176
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,870
something we always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> working we want</font>

177
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,229
it working when we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to be cut</font>

178
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,030
off on

179
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,770
highway right we won it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in we want to</font>

180
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,359
intuitively turn away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car</font>

181
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,460
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run into us but we don't</font>

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,550
always need or one our intuition working

183
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,620
the way that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font>

184
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,330
whatever reason built to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

185
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,950
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tried to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fool as you fool you in</font>

186
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,710
the sense that i highlighted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quick</font>

187
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,300
version of these tests and if you don't

188
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,849
stop to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and you</font>

189
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,850
will get it wrong because your brain you

190
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,830
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> good jumps to an answer this kind</font>

191
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">of all comes from some foundational</font>

192
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:34,990
research by two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different groups led by</font>

193
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,030
Kahneman and Thaler so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is decades</font>

194
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,650
old this is stuff you can read about if

195
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,590
you've heard of this book Thinking Fast

196
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,890
and Slow or the book nudge by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Taylor and</font>

197
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,960
something they go into it in great depth

198
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,260
and depending on your style<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reading</font>

199
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,190
or or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of writing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you like</font>

200
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,710
Thinking Fast and Slow is more

201
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,510
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you or nudge is more</font>

202
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,120
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but either way they</font>

203
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:00,760
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about this concept of system</font>

204
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,420
one or the intuitive system or the slow

205
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">system or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fastest term renter or</font>

206
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">system to or the reflective system okay</font>

207
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,560
so here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown automatic</font>

208
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,770
thinking instinctive thinking emotional

209
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,090
concrete and immediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that as we</font>

210
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,460
were going through that that set of

211
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,710
quick tests the slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> cysts the second</font>

212
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,239
system is slow is logical that's why

213
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,849
reflective is another way is another

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,010
word for it deliberate and it requires

215
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,450
effort so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get worn</font>

216
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,680
out at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day is because</font>

217
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,409
you've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking all day and that</font>

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,750
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> brain power that's why most of us</font>

219
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,510
are most fresh and available to make

220
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:40,150
solid good decisions slow thoughtful

221
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,710
logical decisions in the morning here's

222
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,079
a hack for you if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

223
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,750
make a really big decision and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

224
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,370
them to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it don't ask them at</font>

225
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the workday it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

226
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,240
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you now have intuitively</font>

227
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,770
figured out but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you need</font>

228
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to make a decision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you have a</font>

229
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,100
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put some in the calendar don't</font>

230
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,439
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the end of the day put it in</font>

231
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beginning of the day you'll get more</font>

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,110
thoughtful deliberate slow thinking from

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,020
people the point of all this is that in

234
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">your intuition in my intuition can be</font>

235
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,890
wrong keep that in mind as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go let's</font>

236
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
talk a little about behavior as well

237
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,390
here's a typical email that we might

238
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,120
receive right from a project manager

239
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's terse its bluntness demanding how</font>

240
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,880
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have received a message like</font>

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,420
that from it from their manager or

242
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,380
another manager in in the company right

243
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:30,540
is this am I wrong right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the</font>

244
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,950
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you think about is in terms</font>

245
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,380
of how this<font color="#CCCCCC"> person is behaving towards</font>

246
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,450
you is I'm in trouble right<font color="#E5E5E5"> either I'm</font>

247
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,100
late on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something or I owe something</font>

248
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:43,080
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person or what's wrong what did I</font>

249
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,490
do wrong right the second kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of email</font>

250
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,590
you might get in terms of the way that

251
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,660
somebody's behaving a mark director in

252
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:53,130
particular you might get an enthusiastic

253
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,390
optimistic very unclear email and the

254
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,830
first thing I think about when I get

255
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,370
these kind of emails because yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

256
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">these as well is I'm confused what is</font>

257
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,210
supposed to happen here what is my job

258
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,819
what is my role what's going on this

259
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,010
person's behavior via email admittedly

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,510
this person's behavior is confusing me

261
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,030
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that in terms of these</font>

262
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,530
adjectives this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as well me</font>

263
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,050
walking up at having a conversation with

264
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:19,500
Austin I could be terse and blunt and

265
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,280
demanding in my communication verbally I

266
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,920
can be enthusiastic and optimistic and

267
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,959
unclear in my communication with you as

268
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,640
well there's a third<font color="#CCCCCC"> example from a</font>

269
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,350
developer perhaps from some<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in the</font>

270
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,660
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might receive an email that</font>

271
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,430
is very thorough and it's very objective

272
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,750
and there's no way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could possibly</font>

273
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,699
comply with it because it is very

274
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,890
uncompromising we must do it this way

275
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,720
there is no option and because we're all

276
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,220
security people we have been this person

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,650
as well so the first thing I think about

278
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,900
when I really do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get emails like</font>

279
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,850
this is I'm overwhelmed what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed</font>

280
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,400
to happen here again the behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

281
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person is confusing me how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am I</font>

282

284
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a typical email industry in this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">regard but the point is that our</font>

286
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,660
interpretation of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things because</font>

287
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,069
it was an email and it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

the way that they're that they're trying

I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> meshes that is making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> react let me</font>

294
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,090
down and and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you understand</font>

295
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,010
what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was an email</font>

296
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,140
it's written you only have one

297
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,810
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interpret this and your</font>

298
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,890
interpretation can be wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

299
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,760
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know these kind of the</font>

300
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,560
people you're working with so that's why

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all important so let's go now</font>

302
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,310
into how we can understand some of these

303
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,630
things how we can understand what might

304
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,849
be going on first we'll work on the

305
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:48,030
behavioral piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some of the stuff</font>

306
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:51,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw is based on the behavioral</font>

307
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:54,510
instrument style called disc<font color="#E5E5E5"> d is C</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

308
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,160
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are classic disc behavioral styles</font>

309
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,980
that i'll explain in just a second

310
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,660
behavioral<font color="#E5E5E5"> styles are not personalities</font>

311
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

312
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,170
myers-briggs personality type<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

313
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the same thing as your disc</font>

314
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,770
personality to your disc behavioral

315
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,780
style you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your disc</font>

316
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,880
behavioral style depending on who you're

317
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,310
working with that's a key takeaway for

318
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,960
you that if disc is something that

319
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,310
starts to get as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I explained it if it's</font>

320
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,020
appealing to you you want to learn

321
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">something more about how to work with</font>

322
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,730
other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can learn that with a</font>

323
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,040
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should also be a</font>

324
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,260
little bit more terse and blunt and

325
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,240
straightforward with a marketing

326
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,120
director you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit more</font>

327
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,720
enthusiastic or at least willing to talk

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the person's weakened versus what</font>

329
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,750
they need this monday morning right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

330
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,640
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disc but</font>

331
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,410
it can become<font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful in</font>

332
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,030
understanding how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decipher the navy</font>

333
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,020
roll style or the communication of

334
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:55,050
people you're working with so again d is

335
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,050
over here so the the breakdown of dizzy

336
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,510
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> C is everything above the line is</font>

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">extroverted everything below</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the line is</font>

338
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,310
introverted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everything to the right</font>

339
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,960
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quadrant of the line is focused</font>

340
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,380
on people and everything to the left

341
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,900
focus on tasks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so up top or let</font>

342
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,390
upper left quadrant task extroverted

343
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,939
right very forceful<font color="#CCCCCC"> very dominant in</font>

344
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:21,540
your face let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that let's get the</font>

345
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,400
question answered I contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay really</font>

346
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,730
wants to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the job</font>

347
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,740
done lots of managers leaders executives

348
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,960
fall into this category not even

349
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily inherently it's just a choke</font>

350
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,950
they get results<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

351
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,349
so if the if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> activist to get</font>

352
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">results then D is often the area you</font>

353
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,970
fall into<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because again you can</font>

354
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:44,579
change your behavioral style I in the

355
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,320
extroverted area focused on people I am

356
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,110
a high I believe it or not so I'm

357
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,060
enthusiastic and optimistic and

358
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,480
oftentimes unclear with my team as some

359
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,520
of them can assert or kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of test two</font>

360
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,620
and then most often in our technical

361
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,689
crowd like today a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SI will find an IT or</font>

362
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,180
insecurity in particular will find the

363
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,920
conscientious folks most often the

364
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,510
predominant folks in the audience or see

365
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,400
tricky yeah what's that oh yeah yeah

366
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,110
folks who work folks who are multiple so

367
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,910
the disc the disc model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much a</font>

368
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,710
multiple so it's it's it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively</font>

369
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:25,380
rare but you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three you can't</font>

370
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,120
because you really have 400 for but but

371
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,680
Utah probably tested wrong if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you test</font>

372
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,910
it all for but you can have you can

373
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,130
represent in<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or most often you see</font>

374
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,040
folks going to show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but most of it</font>

375
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">again highly often you'll have people</font>

376
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,089
who are high in one area I don't want to

377
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,730
dwell too much on it but the point is

378
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,820
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> d folks can get straight to</font>

379
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,860
the point they can get they can be right

380
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,840
in your face until until they get what

381
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,560
they're what they're looking for I folks

382
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,690
are influenced are your collaborators

383
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're enthusiastic people but but they</font>

384
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention to</font>

385
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you need to cultivate people</font>

386
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:07,050
like me so that I I feel like like I'm

387
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being ignored are your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esas are your</font>

388
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,160
biggest team players your strongest team

389
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,260
players because again they are

390
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,030
introverted and reserved but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

391
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,010
people focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're really</font>

392
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,439
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on making sure that the team</font>

393
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,240
succeeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay not necessarily that the</font>

394
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,490
tasks are accomplished but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team</font>

395
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,890
succeeds they're very supportive and

396
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,560
calm<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're excellent excellent team</font>

397
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,780
leaders conscientious folks again hi

398
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:38,040
often in tech environments you'll see

399
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:39,870
this this display itself and so both the

400
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,089
most rewarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the hardest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

401
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">about working with sees is the objective</font>

402
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,970
pneus and

403
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,920
the thoroughness and detail so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

404
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:51,560
it can take a while to get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer out</font>

405
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,878
of the sea because you know the tendency

406
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,800
there is to be thorough and make sure

407
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's right and i's are</font>

408
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:03,019
dotted and T's are crossed 50 times<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

409
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:04,160
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um with that background in</font>

410
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:05,959
terms of behavior now we're going to

411
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,060
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that intuition or thinking</font>

412
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,729
ideas we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of major concepts</font>

413
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,349
behavior and intuition talked about

414
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,939
behavior and<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk well now we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

415
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about intuition and thinking</font>

416
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,199
especially in terms of becoming or

417
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:19,790
architecting choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned a</font>

418
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,349
little earlier before but but a brief

419
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,849
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of falls in</font>

the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of behavioral economics and</font>

behavioral psychology it's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

422
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,420
part pioneered by comment and Tversky

423
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,649
and Thaler and Sunstein okay these are

424
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,110
your father's or leaders in the space

425
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,939
plenty of research papers also some

426
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,139
accessible<font color="#E5E5E5"> books that are accessible to</font>

00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:41,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and me I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know about the</font>

428
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,639
research papers being accessible

429
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:46,969
depending on your on which way you go

430
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,699
there but but but certainly there's tons

431
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,500
and tons of research and content here

432
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:52,969
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again just to be clear with</font>

433
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,009
everything they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in</font>

434
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,769
this area this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all backed up by</font>

435
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,689
strong research science I am NOT a

436
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,209
research scientist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area i am not</font>

437
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:03,949
an expert but these guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

438
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:06,379
they've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the research this goes</font>

439
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:08,270
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the 70s so they've been doing</font>

440
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,949
this stuff for you know four or five

441
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:16,609
decades let's talk about one approach so

442
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mentioned the book the book</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nudge by</font>

443
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,500
Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein and

444
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:24,319
this is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their approach to doing</font>

445
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,809
choice architecture or decision

446
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,360
architecture is here and it's actually

447
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it follows you can see it follows the</font>

448
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,020
the retro<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIM here but incentives right</font>

449
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,490
people really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know that that</font>

450
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,330
there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for making this choice</font>

451
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,179
if there's that they're getting

452
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you need to help them</font>

453
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,260
understand what's going on and

454
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,720
understand how they see things again the

455
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,900
behavioral stuff can help you set up a

456
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,789
default so we talked a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> insecurity</font>

457
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about secure by default or building</font>

458
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:56,010
security in by design right and this is

459
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,840
part of the

460
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,890
choice architecture concept go figure we

461
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,320
weren't the first people to think about

462
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um giving feedback expecting</font>

463
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,129
that people are going to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes</font>

464
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,110
again very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common in our line of work to</font>

465
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,120
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> / tip for cheese and prepare</font>

466
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,469
situations what we expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

467
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,209
is going to make is going to do

468
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">something wrong or respect that they're</font>

469
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a mistake as well as</font>

470
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:25,320
setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so that we can break</font>

471
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:28,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">it down and not be overly complex so the</font>

472
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with a hard decision the more</font>

473
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,070
complex it is the least likely it is for

474
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,240
someone to even make a decision they're

475
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn away and go somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

476
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,380
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make complex decisions</font>

477
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,990
that are complex like some of the ones

478
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,810
we have to architect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to break</font>

479
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,880
it down into small sizable chunks or

480
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:48,870
understandable chunks so that it's a

481
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,180
simple and an easy to understand this is

482
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,280
the kind of second approach just in

483
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,740
terms of understanding how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to design</font>

484
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,170
choices and architectures or how to

485
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,820
architect choices this is described in

486
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,730
detail in a Harvard Business Review

487
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,409
article that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have a link for you on</font>

488
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,360
but their approach is similar in a sense

489
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to define the problem you</font>

490
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,649
diagnose it and you design that solution

491
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's talk through that this</font>

492
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,030
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing that we're talking about</font>

493
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,490
here understanding people's intuition

494
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:24,149
understanding people's intuitive choices

495
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,580
and decisions is most most effective

496
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,630
when their behavior the choices that

497
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,870
people are gonna make as a core<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

498
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:33,060
problem and people are not always able

499
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> act in their own best interests now</font>

500
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,330
you have to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

501
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,800
paternalistic here okay and realize and

502
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:41,939
again we're in security so this is part

503
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,909
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do but we have made some sort</font>

504
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,320
of of assertion that we know the right

505
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,780
decision right at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know the</font>

506
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,179
secure decision it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be the the</font>

507
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,700
businesses business risk based decision

508
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,800
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the secure decision is</font>

509
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,360
here and that's that's the idea in terms

510
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,830
of people's best interest from a

511
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,340
security standpoint or where we're

512
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:07,199
coming from now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of figuring out</font>

513
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,669
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cause of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an appropriate</font>

514
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision is or what what</font>

515
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,750
may be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong like why people are</font>

516
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,520
making poor decisions why people aren't

517
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,620
making the secure decision we want them

518
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,379
to make these are the two main causes

519
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,179
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't motivated to take that</font>

520
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:26,020
action which goes back again to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

521
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:27,730
incentives concept or they have some

522
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,500
sort of cognitive bias<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in</font>

523
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,710
making that decision you know they have

524
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,690
sort of of thinking mode that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

525
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,190
it impossible for them to see the right

526
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,170
choice and availability heuristic a

527
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,580
selection bias a confirmation bias these

528
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,250
kinds of biases which are described

529
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,750
again in exhaustive detail in the books

530

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have for you thinking fast and</font>

531
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:53,160
slow and nudge these biases that come

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:56,110
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> play can prevent you and me from</font>

533
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:59,260
honestly even seeing the right decision

of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculus in determining and</font>

536
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,940
building a decision in terms of security

537
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,260
in terms of how you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

541
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:19,629
completely miss that they'll never be

542
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:23,590
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the right decision okay now</font>

543
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,840
in designing the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution we want</font>

544
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,510
to improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks decisions we want to to</font>

545
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,240
structure and design that choice and

546
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,700
then slowly nudge and gently gently

547
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,540
gently nudge people in the right

548
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,000
direction the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to a good</font>

549
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,820
solution a good choice that we architect

550
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,780
is that people still feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they have</font>

551
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,270
the freedom to make the choice let's

552
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,760
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bit more detail here about</font>

553
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples and and kind of clear things up</font>

554
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,660
and I'm curious if folks have some

555
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting examples they've used in</font>

556
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,000
their workplace so again we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

557
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:04,090
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can leverage people's</font>

558
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
intuitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> or reflective thinking in</font>

559
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,470
terms of system one triggering these are

560
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,240
the ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it right you want</font>

561
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,070
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want somebody to think fast on</font>

562
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,050
purpose right so if you want them to

563
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the right decision um then you can</font>

564
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,658
focus on getting them to feel something

565
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,689
right the most common way

566
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:27,669
that this was done in security was the

567
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,799
fear uncertainty doubt concept right so

568
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to trigger somebody to make the</font>

569
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,769
right decision by spreading fear by

570
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:38,139
spreading us by fomenting some sort of

571
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:39,609
emotion that's going to push people in

572
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:42,549
the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction now I'm not</font>

573
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,109
advocating for that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you it</font>

574
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:46,869
can be effective at least initially

575
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,580
right I think many of us have some

576
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:51,549
experience with that I've mentioned some

577
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,678
bias concepts here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also process</font>

578
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,529
simplification but let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you say</font>

579
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,739
that that the most powerful way to

580
00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:01,570
leverage quick or fast thinking in terms

581
00:22:59,739 --> 00:23:03,460
of getting the right collaborative

582
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,678
decision-making the right collaborative

583
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,349
choice architecture is in building a

584
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,539
default workflow or default loadout or

585
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:15,158
default system that is secure the

586
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:18,849
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you want right so the</font>

587
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:21,369
most common way that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done in in</font>

588
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,720
like HR systems and business we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font>

589
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:26,859
experienced whether you realize it or

590
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,830
not it's a retirement savings plans<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

591
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:31,418
so you may or you may or may not realize

592
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it may it may be different in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

593
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization's but many organizations</font>

594
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,470
now because of the research work done in

595
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,179
this area your default when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

596
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,099
provision or when you sign up or when

597
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,809
you get when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you take the job</font>

598
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:46,539
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've taken an hour you've been</font>

599
00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:50,229
given a choice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a contribution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

600
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:52,299
defined contribution plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> your default</font>

601
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,859
now is that you're enrolled your default

602
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:55,330
is that you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent</font>

603
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:56,769
contribution or a five percent or

604
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,549
whatever it is right i mean something

605
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:03,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that that that that's digestible or</font>

606
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:05,559
that you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make but you have</font>

607
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,879
to opt out now right I mean how many

608
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,239
folks have seen what I'm talking about

609
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:11,859
you familiar with what okay no so so um

610
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:13,899
do you have a retirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan at work</font>

611
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:17,408
and if so because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only saw a few hands</font>

612
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:19,299
raised if so are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> enrolled gate and</font>

613
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:22,029
and and were you given the option to

614
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,279
enroll<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid to to opt out or is this an</font>

615
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,570
opt-in program for you guys anybody

616
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:29,659
willing to volunteer some details

617
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,899
it's only opt-in okay so so the research

618
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:37,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't work done in this area is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

619
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:41,360
there is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the order of if</font>

620
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:43,699
you give folks the opt-in opportunity

621
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,758
then something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like ten to twenty</font>

622
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,460
percent of people opt in to a retirement

623
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,399
savings plan right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical to</font>

624
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep you being healthy in you know over</font>

625
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:55,489
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> age and if you make it opted</font>

626
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,408
out it's something closer to fifty

627
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:59,600
percent right so I mean there are

628
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:02,570
drastic changes here another<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

629
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,340
common<font color="#CCCCCC"> way in which this is this happens</font>

630
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:07,490
again is financial and again it's in the

631
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate setting is in is in other</font>

632
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">kinds of savings plans right where where</font>

633
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,629
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's another kind of</font>

634
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,850
program we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a defined retirement</font>

635
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:19,509
savings program and right now you're

636
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,428
enrolled at one percent and every year

637
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:23,509
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell us otherwise every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

638
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,539
from now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

639
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:28,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">contribution by half a percent so you</font>

640
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,679
can opt out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but every year from</font>

641
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,029
here on out we're going to raise you up

642
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,230
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-and-a-half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent and then two</font>

643
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:35,149
percent and then two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a half percent</font>

644
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,309
and then three percent and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

645
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,830
why that works is because it's a future

646
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:42,590
planning concept and all of us just

647
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,629
inherently are built to think of it

648
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,279
that's tomorrow today is what I'm

649
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:49,070
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tomorrow will take</font>

650
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:50,840
care of itself this is one way in which

651
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,960
this is being triggered and I don't have

652
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,789
a lot of great ways other than negative

653
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,159
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage on security</font>

654
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,658
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious if there are examples of</font>

655
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,049
ways in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have taken</font>

656
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:05,990
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fast thinking or kind of</font>

657
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,429
emotional or biased based choices that

658
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,960
people have architect does anybody have

659
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,610
anything interesting that they that

660
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done or seen been a participant</font>

661
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:18,570
of or a party<font color="#E5E5E5"> too yeah</font>

662
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:24,930
developers and the security guys

663
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:27,000
together nice it's good it's a good

664
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,690
example that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example again it</font>

665
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">be yeah yeah so the example is kind of</font>

666
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,070
pride in craftsmanship or pride of

667
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,590
ownership in terms of the result right

668
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:41,700
the bill or the or the or the or the

669
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:44,100
release of software right not playing on

670
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,410
as much as just arousing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emotion or</font>

671
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,000
the investment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a development team</font>

672
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,100
or a development group or a whole

673
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,920
company has made<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the result of that</font>

674
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,689
software of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resulting software right</font>

675
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,060
we don't want it to just do it as

676
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,840
supposed to do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to also not do</font>

677
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:09,929
what it's not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

678
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:13,800
ma'am yeah absolutely absolutely the

679
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,410
tearing of the default right so the

680
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,169
district repeating that that the the

681
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,180
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> option or the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the easy</font>

682
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,520
path is what folks are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose</font>

683
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,500
so designing that and creating that is

684
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,540
what we want to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to always strive two</font>

685
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,200
wars and finding a way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which in which</font>

686
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,020
it happens right so um some other ways

687
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,560
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might happen is in terms of</font>

688
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:39,690
hey let me automatically feed in results

689
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,389
from a security from a security tool

690
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,700
into your rainy remediation system for

691
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,440
as developers right so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

692
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,080
giving you something more to do rather

693
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,730
than slapping a report on your desk and

694
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,320
hey here they're here the bugs you have

695
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,030
to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your software we're here the</font>

696
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,030
flaws you have to fix let me make it

697
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:59,430
easy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you let me set up and queue up</font>

698

this this this bugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> this flaw do you</font>

699
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,790
have to fix let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in your</font>

700
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,750
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make it so easy for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:08,460
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your agile backlog or whatever</font>

702
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to do in terms of planning</font>

let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me put it right there in front of</font>

705
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and so it's easy for you to say you</font>

706

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I can tackle one of those</font>

707
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,970
security bugs this this Brent I can we

708
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,770
can we can tackle this<font color="#E5E5E5"> group right here</font>

709
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,880
and take<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next time</font>

710
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's right there they already</font>

711
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,920
made it easy for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright in terms of</font>

712
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,510
system to stuff this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

713
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,780
as where you want to set up situations

714
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,230
we want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunities to give</font>

715
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people opportunities to think more okay</font>

716
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,910
this is much more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we where</font>

717
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,580
we end up in security what we're trying

718
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,890
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make people think versus the</font>

719
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,510
opposite where they are not thinking

720
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,830
right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just clicking on the link</font>

721
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,900
when they get the email oh it's good

722
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,580
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a link in I must</font>

723
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,080
click it right there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email with a</font>

724
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,909
PDF attachment I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double</font>

725
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">click it that's what I do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> double click</font>

726
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,260
PDF attachments when they come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

727
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,060
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is create</font>

728
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,970
opportunities for folks to reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

729
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:08,399
take a step back the best example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

730
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,990
here is in prepending email subjects

731
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,960
when they come in from anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> external</font>

732
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,240
right so you get a message from outside

733
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,660
the company just any email right like

734
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,370
marketing email your buddy at another

735
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,050
company send you a message to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say where</font>

736
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:24,449
we going for lunch whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

737
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:28,200
matter um<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's prepended with something</font>

738
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,210
like external or outside or probably not

739
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,980
suspicious but may be suspicious who

740
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,680
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you prepend the email subject</font>

741
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,800
every email subject from outside the

742
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,910
organization in a particular way what

743
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:44,310
that does now is create a chance for

744
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,770
people to look and see and notice whoa

745
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,629
that's not for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my CEO because it has the</font>

746
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,820
external tag right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

747
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,740
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't compute I have a</font>

748
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,689
message it looks like it's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my IT</font>

749
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,130
team a message it looks like it's from

750
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,650
security saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

751
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,330
password but it says external there's

752
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">something broken here there's something</font>

753
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,620
that now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step back and</font>

754
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">think for a second and see wait there's</font>

755
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,500
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not right here okay</font>

756
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:13,080
other examples that folks have in how

757
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,090
they engage system<font color="#E5E5E5"> too how do you make</font>

758
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think slowly how do you make</font>

759
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,679
people reflect when you want them to

760
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,010
make the right choice what are you guys

761
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,010
doing

762
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,700
sir

763
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it unpacked a little bit more</font>

764
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me ask people to reflect ask people</font>

765
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:48,380
to think what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you okay okay so-so</font>

766
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">hmm yeah yeah yeah I'm trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

767
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,810
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and figure out what what where</font>

768
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,310
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go with that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UH in terms of</font>

769
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,110
like working collaborating maybe in a

770
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,970
meeting or making it in trying to in

771
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:04,070
trying to understand decisions well we

772
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,600
can we can do is um is talk through loss

773
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,639
as we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past or mistakes we've</font>

774
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,360
made in the past because we're all we're

775
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">all inclined to make we're all inclined</font>

776
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,979
to fear loss or it's called loss

777
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,159
aversion that's another cognitive bias

778
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,160
we're all inclined to make a choice that

779
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:28,070
okay here's an example so um if you're

780
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:31,250
if you're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to invest money in say a</font>

781
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,080
stock okay and in your day trader right

782
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,910
or you trade daily you look at your the

783
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,860
stock you're investing daily and you see

784
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you lost five thousand dollars</font>

785
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,909
yesterday that feels but believe it or

786
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,889
not this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested and stuff so</font>

787
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,230
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on this one but that feels</font>

788
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,080
about the same as tomorrow you seeing

789
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,290
you made<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten thousand dollars losses</font>

790
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,379
feel about twice as big or twice as much

791
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:57,409
as wins but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on paper</font>

792
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,850
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long term then you</font>

793
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,740
made five thousand dollars right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

794
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,129
you lost five thousand one day you made

795
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,240
ten thousand the next write it in the

796
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,150
great scheme of things you made some

797
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,850
money but the point is that losses feel

798
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,770
bigger they feel stronger so what we can

799
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,419
do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of looking at history or</font>

800
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,550
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how we've worked together if</font>

801
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,690
people are inclined to not make the

802
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,639
right decision because they feel like

803
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that last time you made this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

804
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,350
something went wrong we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

805
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:26,510
expand more about what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in</font>

806
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,070
the history what's happened in what

807
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:30,650
we've done in the past and talk a little

808
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:32,750
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how really you know in</font>

809
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long run we've made we've been</font>

810
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,430
successful i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

811
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,200
move on and finish up here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

812
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,559
in summary in terms of effective

813
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,139
collaboration

814
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,799
we've talked a lot about about intuitive

815
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:48,090
thinking and reflective thinking it's

816
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,470
blending out between system one and

817
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,149
system two activities there are

818
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,240
advantages to both in terms of how we

819
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">define choices and architect decisions</font>

820
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
for folks and we talked a little about

821
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,519
behavioral styles of people and

822
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,039
understanding what it means to be in

823
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,480
each of these areas and how folks behave

824
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:05,639
and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can work with different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font>

825
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the main point there is that</font>

826
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,799
you can adjust how you think and how you

827
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,219
work because if you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

831
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking and talking and speaking and</font>

832

<font color="#E5E5E5">writing email like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I believe it or</font>

833
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:30,809
not all right I have I promised a series

834

time we're a little bit differently i'm

872
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,799
going to pass the mic so the audio

873

879
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,439
regularity great question trip do so

880
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,419
with a little bit of prep and study you

881
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,250
don't have to do this thoroughly on

882
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,660
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single person right so there's a</font>

883
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">few different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of approaches you</font>

884
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,259
could take the approach of I'm leading

my team I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lead my team more</font>

886
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,119
effectively so team we're all going to

887
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,720
take the disc instrument together that

888
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,790
is an approach right but unless your

889
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,680
entire company you know post their disc

890
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,359
profile on their doors or on their

891
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,950
internet internet portal and you know

892
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,619
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not something you just know</font>

893
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,319
intuitively however the more familiar

894
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,910
you get with<font color="#E5E5E5"> disc and I can tell you</font>

895
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:00,440
that all I've really done is listen to

896
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,990
the integer tools guys talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

897
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">do my own personal analysis of people</font>

00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,890
that I meet and interact with and talk

899
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,650
with friends about disc you become

900
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:11,930
better at kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picking out you know</font>

what this person is acting like a d let

me be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> d with them to communicate</font>

903
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:18,980
better this person is acting like a sea

904
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,690
let me be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> thorough and detailed in</font>

905
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,290
my response versus what I would normally

906
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:26,359
do which is yes no done right you know

907
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right that's how I respond because</font>

00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:31,910
I tend towards d during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> workday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike</font>

909
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:33,790
can attest to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um but when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

910
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a thorough message from Mike</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes Mike may expect a very</font>

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,579
thorough response for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font>

913
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,799
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but but it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be that that</font>

914
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:44,839
that i can work better that way so you

915
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,940
can pick things up and you can just do

916
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:49,578
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> intuitively does that make sense that</font>

917
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,760
answer your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good other</font>

00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,740
sorry it's more of an administrative

920
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:04,350
question did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did you indicate the</font>

922
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,900
really because<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not really because</font>

923
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,910
there are a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's one</font>

924
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,530
or two free ones I've seen which are

925
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,660
fine to just become familiar with it but

926
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're very interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I recommend</font>

927
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the manager tool site and doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">disc through them because they have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very thorough instrument analysis and</font>

930
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:27,630
they give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lots of information not</font>

931
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,460
just about what your behavioral style

932
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">means but how you can work with other</font>

933
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,110
behavioral styles as a manager or as a

934
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,370
direct report of a manager so the other

935
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,080
reason why this might be interesting to

936
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,850
you is if you've had friction or

937
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,910
difficulty working with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager or</font>

938
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,650
other team managers this might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a way</font>

939
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,020
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can smooth some of that</font>

940
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,790
friction out so you may get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own the</font>

behavioral style<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess and figure out</font>

944
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,130
manager tool site is a great resource

945
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:01,259
for that great resource for that if

946
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,030
you're an audio learner like me sorry

947
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,400
Matt if you're an audio or learner like

948
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,230
me all their<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is in podcast form so</font>

949
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know get it on the</font>

950
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,690
on the commute to work you know when you

951
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,720
started looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at discs did you look at</font>

952
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,940
any of the other assessment systems and

953
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,149
compare them how did you I didn't I

954
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,710
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I've I found that it</font>

955
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,240
really works for me I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very I'm</font>

956
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,850
relatively familiar with myers-briggs

957
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,560
and some of the other personality type

958
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,880
instruments so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of had some of</font>

959
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,049
that background as I learned more about

960
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,850
disc but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard the manager tools guys</font>

961
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,080
talk more about disc and how it's useful

962
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,819
in terms of understanding people's

963
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,640
behaviors and how they're communicating

964
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,830
with me it was much more intuitive and

965
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:48,569
easier to use than say understanding

966
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:50,520
that oh I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> enf ENFP there you know is</font>

967
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,900
TJ how am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

968
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,640
there's there's ways to figure that out

969
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,440
as well but it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder this</font>

970
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,440
for me I'm i need something simpler

971
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:12,140
come on thanks for a good talk I've been

972
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:17,990
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out about this like 15 years ago</font>

973
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry I did cook that better one of</font>

974
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:22,250
the things i was thinking of that causes

975
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pause and move to that level</font>

976
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:27,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that slower thinking that we see all</font>

977
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time are these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you go to a</font>

does are you sure and also with the

to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my retirement site actually</font>

985
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,060
popped up a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said please be</font>

986
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:49,009
aware market volatility doesn't mean you

987
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,480
have to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so i was</font>

know exactly what you mean and and but

993
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,160
but your example is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

994
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,660
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in security we can</font>

995
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:12,710
see the results of ultimately

996
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:15,020
ineffective UI design and and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">user experience situations because I</font>

998
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,540
suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe not us in this crowd</font>

999
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,580

referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to right so people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us may</font>

1004
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:32,780
think wait a minute you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah alert</font>

1005
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,430
alert you know the certificate is broken

1006
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,800
and it works for us because we

1007
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:40,399
intuitively think slightly different

1008
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,550
then we built other systems and in terms

1009
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,170
of how we see the browser right how it

1010
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,849
appears to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us but other folks have</font>

1011
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,410
become their intuitive thinking is

1012
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,670
that's that's a box i'm supposed to

1013
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,680
click through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1014
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,690
anything about it right and so that's

1015
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">just I mean it's this is not to say</font>

1016
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,330
anything that because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1017
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,359
better I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1018
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,220
it but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is poor user experience that</font>

1019
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,730
user experience it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because</font>

1020
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:07,609
it's not it's not an architect it well

1021
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:09,890
as a security team there's all ton ton

1022
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:12,170
and ton of work that security has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1023
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,890
in architecting better choices for

1024
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,450
people

1025
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright we have time for maybe another</font>

1026
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:28,759
question anybody else dirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phillip out</font>

1027
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,660
of desk which group was the most

1028
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,940
challenging to communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

1029
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:39,710
did you overcome the challenges okay so

1030
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:41,600
um let me see if I have I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna I</font>

1031
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,650
know how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can answer that question so</font>

1032
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,700
if you looked at use a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> quadroon</font>

1033
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">down here um in general so I man i right</font>

1034
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:54,529
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general my opposite is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C so that</font>

1035
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:57,259
the tip typically you know the people

1036
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,930
that you are opposite to is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font>

1037
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have the hardest time interacting</font>

1038
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,399
with or working with as their kind of

1039
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:08,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> well they're the opposite of you and</font>

1040
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,720
so this if this is my default behavioral

1041
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:14,660
style I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really check it when I'm</font>

1042
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,600
particularly working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas okay and</font>

1043
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,509
similarly with DS they can run roughshod

1044
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:24,589
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> esas though this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

1045
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:27,500
calm methodical helpful supportive folks

1046
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:30,140
a dominant d personality you can just

1047
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,300
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do it my way and you</font>

1048
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,830
know maybe they<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it does happen</font>

1049
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,450
their way but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

1050
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,910
way to do it or that maybe I'd not be

1051
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,830
the most effective and so the you have

1052
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,310
to be the most careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and disc with</font>

1053
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:46,340
these opposing or opposite behavioral

1054
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:49,190
styles design use your question a little

1055
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,710
bit yeah yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I i</font>

1056
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:55,460
think the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardest thing that I</font>

1057
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:58,430
have in terms of a disc is understanding

1058
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,560
how I can make different or more how I

1059
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,609
can adjust my own behavior so I tendon

1060
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,960
as an eye I tend to be very extroverted

1061
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:09,010
interactive with people I tend to make

1062
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,060
eye contact and speak loudly and and and

1063
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,890
energetically that doesn't make

1064
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,710
everybody comfortable it may not have

1065
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,600
made everybody comfortable in this talk

1066
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,460
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point being that if I especially</font>

1067
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,339
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-on-one with somebody who is</font>

1068
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,570
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of not you know kind of</font>

1069
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,130
change how they're looking and maybe

1070
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,250
looking a little down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> being very</font>

1071
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,140
thoughtful and

1072
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,120
slowing down how they're talking and

1073
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll quieter what I've learned is that</font>

1074
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,430
i need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do I didn't be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar I</font>

1075
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:38,160
need to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> less eye contact I need to</font>

1076
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:42,180
be a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more thoughtful and methodical</font>

1077
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,390
with how I talk absolutely absolutely

1078
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,980
thank you I agree yes it's very hard

1079
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,660
it's very hard but that's the challenge

1080
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to meet we went</font>

1081
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,279
perfective in our collaboration with

1082
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,210
folks that's the challenge thanks

1083
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,210
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>
