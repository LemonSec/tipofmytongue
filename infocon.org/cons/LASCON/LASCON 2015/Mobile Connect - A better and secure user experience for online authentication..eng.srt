<font color="#CCCCCC">salient use it for one year try a</font>

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,920
different couple of one so wonderful

28
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,900
practice lowercase and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,010
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody click on the forgot</font>

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:58,130
password get my email inbox do all the

31
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:01,700
different steps and finally got my renew

32
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:05,750
password in there good now we can

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,229
register for askin ah ok now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:12,440
reenter my information my home address

35
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:15,140
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information so basically</font>

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,940
from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> unusual respective yes I should</font>

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,890
not have forgot my password but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

38
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,079
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it once a year what can we</font>

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect not such a great and user</font>

40
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience and this is a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typical</font>

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,840
let's say

42
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,650
experience for end users in everyday

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,240
life so these two to bring to a point

44
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,520
that one of the main to pain points that

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:44,120
we are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to me to discuss and</font>

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,820
to to resolve during this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic is one</font>

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,190
the multiplicity of credential so yes we

48
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,420
have accounts all over the place so why

49
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,579
do I we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same password follow</font>

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and then just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Reno security I've</font>

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,670
ever use different password and it's a

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,270
mess to manage all the different

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,458
credential on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends whenever we</font>

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,770
go to a new website we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to create a</font>

55
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">new account reenter all with information</font>

56
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,310
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows what we're with information</font>

57
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to go oh it's going to be</font>

58
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,440
shared and used useful so we have two

59
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,330
major pain point which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,700
management of credential and the

61
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:21,380
multiplicity of them and on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

62
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:26,810
hand let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say account creation and how</font>

63
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:30,410
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sign up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for new new accounts so</font>

64
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,510
now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I if I bring a compression when</font>

65
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,940
when I want to give a phone call I take

66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">my phone I press the call button that's</font>

67
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,100
it simple nothing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

68
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,709
so we all forget about password but

69
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:48,470
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget his phone number maybe so</font>

70
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:52,519
one so today we're going to talk about

71
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mobile connector and see how it</font>

72
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,769
brings simplicity in like and user

73
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:04,100
experience for these two major pain

74
00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:07,280
point so what if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

75
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords anymore now what</font>

76
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,360
if I know when my accounts on my

77
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:18,340
credentials are used and what if I don't

78
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,989
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or my personal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

79
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,359
so let's see if mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect can</font>

80
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:27,349
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toulouse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a much</font>

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,450
better user experience so during this

82
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,840
plantation we are going to first give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

83
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,960
go for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of existing</font>

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,659
solution and anja limitation for

85
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,950
authentication then we'd go into mobile

86
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,560
connect to be an overview and the

87
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,659
details of it architecture and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font>

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> components that are involved</font>

89
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,560
in to mobile collect will bring some

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,250
example and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kesey's and some are</font>

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,010
real life video of what it could look

92
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,290
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally we will discuss</font>

93
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,810
the challenges that are brought by

94
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:11,610
mobile connector and the deployment of

95
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:14,160
it so first let's online authentication

96
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,100
has been there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time so let's</font>

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,370
look at existing solutions that are out

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,720
there and there are limitations

99
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,640
passwords I mean they're the most widely

100
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">used we are because they are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,849
expensive and inherently<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

102
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">just what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inherently</font>

103
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,660
weak if it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen do you don't know</font>

104
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that somebody else knows your password</font>

105
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,020
how many passwords do you remember you

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,659
know if you make your passwords too

107
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,810
strong it's hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember whereas if</font>

108
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,850
it's too easy it's very easily broken so

109
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,520
a password manager browser out of

110
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,000
autofill do help in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

111
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,530
the weakness is still there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
have stronger solutions that are out

113
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,119
there one time password pki these are

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,300
token-based solutions they're very

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,310
strong the very good but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

116
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,920
very convenient I mean how many tokens

117
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,720
can you carry you know as when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

118
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,020
saying this morning when I took out his

119
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,000
kitchen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had like tens of tokens</font>

120
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,340
in his kitchen so how many do you do it

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,530
becomes difficult to manage pki

122
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,250
lifecycle management is a pain whoever

123
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,750
is working with PK we know about that

124
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,620
then you have out-of-band mobile you

125
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,910
know where a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks and</font>

126
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,830
providers what they do they send an SMS

127
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,950
with a code then you need to put that

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">code into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the website to authenticate it</font>

129
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,289
it's a strong solution but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font>

130
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,990
usability I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

131
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,600
convenient and then you have apps that

132
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,710
are there that you the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sent to</font>

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,100
the mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> app where you just click but</font>

134
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,229
then it requires a smartphone

135
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,030
and then you have other of the band

136
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,790
mobile solutions like that sometimes you

137
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a call is made instead of an SMS</font>

138
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,350
where you listen to that code and enter

139
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,530
that code so it's strong but it's not

140
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,170
very convenient and you have social

141
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,390
login like you can use google and

142
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:16,290
facebook to<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to other websites very</font>

143
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,690
very convenient definitely but not

144
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">vetted you know anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go and open</font>

145
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,960
an account on google and facebook

146
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:27,180
facebook so how do you trust the

147
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,049
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the user is given how</font>

148
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,390
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the user so it's not vetted</font>

149
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,570
and then what about user data you know

150
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,460
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all realize at some point you</font>

151
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,040
know you go and register something you

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,609
give your<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address next thing you</font>

153
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,410
realize is your being you know bombarded

154
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:52,620
with spam emails so how do you control

155
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:55,140
that and then convenience versus

156
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,930
security always we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

157
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,930
a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very convenient lacks</font>

158
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,160
usually lacks security and which has the

159
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,260
stronger solutions that are out there

160
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,760
are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very convenient so brittle bit</font>

161
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,010
of background so in this in this figure

162
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,760
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side that's the</font>

183
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,490
you don't dire need to have a strong

username and passwords it provides

200
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,579
transaction signing so when you do you

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,700
know transfer money from your bank he

202

206
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,449
the user control so the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to</font>

207
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,810
consent to give out that information to

208
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,640
service providers it's a federated

209
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,060
identity service that means that the

210
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,790
identity is provided by a third party

211
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:39,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's a it's a architecture</font>

212
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:42,209
framework kind which provides various

213
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,310
authentication methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> underneath from</font>

214
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:47,640
lower assurance to higher stronger

215
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">asaurus but importantly it's transparent</font>

216
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,800
to the user so the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience is</font>

217
00:10:49,380 --> 00:11:03,300
the same and it's a it's a standard by

218
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:05,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">gsma that gsma came up in feb2014 so a</font>

219
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,579
little bit on the the standard so mobile

220
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,339
connect is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsm is standard so g SMS</font>

221
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,930
pro specifies a lot of specification

222
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,819
very importantly all these

223
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,979
specifications are based on open

224
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:18,790
standards which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already out there so</font>

225
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,490
they didn't come up

226
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,010
you know of their own standard

227
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,470
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you used the existing</font>

228
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,819
ones that are out there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far service</font>

229
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,600
provider for example it becomes very

230
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they use the open ID</font>

231
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,410
connect and salmon<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 federated identity</font>

232
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,720
so the service providers which are

233
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:42,360
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that it so it becomes easy</font>

234
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,360
for onboarding the service providers and

235
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:58,030
so part of a standard SATA let's say use

236
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,340
by mobile connect as part of its a

237
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,030
foundation on which mobile connect is

238
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,160
basing is a specification one one of

239
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,410
them is relying on what is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

240
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,920
level of assurance has been defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

241
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISO and missed a standard organization</font>

242
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,760
so the level of assurance is basically

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:22,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">for different level of assurance or</font>

244
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,100
security that are going from 1 to 4 1

245
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,339
being the lowest for being biased and

246
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,430
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be let's apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

247
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">different context and different use case</font>

248
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,979
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service provider so first let's</font>

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,319
go a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit into what are visible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

250
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">assurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we can see how we can</font>

251
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,630
be used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of a mobile</font>

252
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,670
mobile connector so first level of

253
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">assurance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 01 is just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little or no</font>

254
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,160
confidence so that would be typically a

255
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:54,459
cookie stored in your brother or maybe

256
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,370
just checking your IP address so it

257
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,320
gives some information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's maybe</font>

258
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same user or the same machine or</font>

259
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,060
some browser coming to your website but

260
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,360
there's really no guarantee about

261
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,400
identity notification of security as per

262
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,890
aspera to say so this one is definitely

263
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,560
not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken into account and</font>

264
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,160
addressed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rumble connect solution for</font>

265
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,459
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> part then we have level</font>

266
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,339
of assurance to which is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

267
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,800
the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know most the username</font>

268
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,570
password for example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we stand out</font>

269
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,760
as a standard one

270
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,680
it could be also the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that you have</font>

271
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,050
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile phone so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a one</font>

272
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,930
factor authentication in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a in some in</font>

273
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:43,310
some ways that's what is mainly used for

274
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:47,250
web or mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> commerce application</font>

275
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,750
application yeah so then we have level

276
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,520
of assurance free<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a</font>

277
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-factor authentication so something</font>

278
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,720
you have and something something you

279
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,150
know so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for example a</font>

280
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,700
one-time password solution where you log

281
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,090
into a website with your credentials and

282
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you have to enter one time password</font>

283
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,840
into with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website from a token that</font>

284
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,940
you measure separately it could be also

285
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,580
a fact that on your mobile phone you

286
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">enter a pin code so that will be another</font>

287
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,660
way so its application wise it's for

288
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,460
like use case like banking or enterprise

289
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,400
where you want to protect for example I

290
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,410
value transaction or transfer funds or

291
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,120
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect some very sensitive</font>

292
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,630
data and access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to critical</font>

293
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,360
infrastructure and then you have level

294
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,930
of assurance for which is let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

295
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,730
based on the level of assurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 with</font>

296
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:44,189
additional as a constraint in<font color="#E5E5E5"> term of</font>

297
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,220
storage of key and cryptography way it

298
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:51,060
is more stringent for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I have</font>

299
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:54,330
to regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> the storage of your critter</font>

300
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,699
graphic information and is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done in</font>

301
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,910
some tamper-resistant device we are some

302
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:03,240
more processes around the management of

303
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,569
who's up with the cryptographic

304
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,250
cryptographic element and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data as</font>

305
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,790
well so whose applications are mostly

306
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">fallout egovernment elf market so like</font>

307
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:19,140
for example citizen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to pay</font>

308
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:23,490
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a citizen card via taxa and</font>

309
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:25,590
this type of things so that's four

310
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,960
different level level of assurance so

311
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,150
with mobile call mobile connector they

312
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,880
are addressing a little reassurance to

313
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:38,490
24 because we level one cuz we not much

314
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,890
security and to be on tweeden so now we

315
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about my mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect so let me</font>

316
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:45,149
tell you from end user standpoint

317
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,620
what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what is it what is</font>

318
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:51,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">will use your experience and what is</font>

319
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,350
happening so on the top on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top left</font>

320
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:56,860
part there you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see I'm grand user</font>

321
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,290
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my to my device to access a</font>

322
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:02,740
website let's say I'm go on to access my

323
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,560
bank for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example so I go there on my pc</font>

324
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,350
go to my bank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on the website</font>

325
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the bank we have a traditional login</font>

326
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,860
name password login page and in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

327
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,670
will have an additional button that will

328
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:20,860
be for login with mobile connect same

329
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:25,389
way that you find today for overall

330
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:28,509
let's say identity provider or identity

331
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:31,480
federation model like Facebook or Google

332
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:33,519
you you have that kind of button then

333
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,730
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to a next page</font>

334
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,120
where you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to enter either</font>

335
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,569
your phone number or an identifier and

336
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,190
that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how its implemented</font>

337
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,990
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented on the sides friday</font>

338
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,899
but in most of a case that would be

339
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,759
implemented in an identity gateway so

340
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,500
satisfied or may not be even<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of</font>

341
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,889
some personal information like your

342
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,689
phone number so then that's on the

343
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,279
conception device so at that point I

344
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,089
enter my phone number or something that

345
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:06,760
will allow the authentication or

346
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:09,129
identity federation to know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am and</font>

347
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,829
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will receive on my phone a</font>

348
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,390
notification so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types</font>

349
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,119
on education<font color="#E5E5E5"> first let's say it's a</font>

350
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:18,250
basic access to my website to a website

351
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,760
i just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consume some information</font>

352
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will receive do you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

353
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,949
your bank yes no and just on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone i</font>

354
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,709
just press ok or cancel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will be</font>

355
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">logged in into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website now let's say</font>

356
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,940
if it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transaction that require</font>

357
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,950
maybe a little bit more security so

358
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,450
let's say now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to transfer some</font>

359
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:47,440
some money oh I want to log on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

360
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:49,630
let's say for 141 k then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may be</font>

361
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,490
in the second use case where instead of

362
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,919
just being asked to click ok or cancel

363
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">two tries you access to my accountant</font>

364
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,980
this time I would be asked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> aunt</font>

365
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pin code on my phone and then I will</font>

366
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,290
be logged in same thing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the</font>

367
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,630
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> so basically on one place we</font>

368
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,770
have a conception device where we try to

369
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,299
access the service project information

370
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,010
and on vro on the bottom part we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

371
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:18,240
mobile phone that is used I've you

372
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:21,160
tonked occasion or transmission device

373
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's kind of for the overall</font>

374
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">world views now let's go let them eat</font>

375
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,500
into more more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> of and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

376
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Johnny so as we just and we just see so</font>

377
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,929
first let's look at the level of

378
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,510
assurance to click<font color="#E5E5E5"> OK user Ajani so</font>

379
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:39,700
that's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the service</font>

380
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,710
provider a page with traditional log in

381
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then in there we have an additional</font>

382
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:50,260
button or whatever for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font>

383
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:53,340
connect option user will click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

384
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,049
will be redirected to an identity

385
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,299
gateway identity federation solution

386
00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:05,350
where you will enter is phone number or

387
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:07,720
some other user ID on T failure then we

388
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,909
prompt it to check his mobile phone on

389
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,490
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> bell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone receive information okay</font>

390
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,100
do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter login into your</font>

391
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,200
account and this message will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fully</font>

392
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,309
configurable by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service friday so</font>

393
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,470
they can put something that is very

394
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:25,690
contextual to what the user is trying to

395
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:27,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">achieve i click ok and then i will be</font>

396
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,590
login into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to</font>

397
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,630
access so in this case it's a major

398
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:38,110
insurance information in the case of

399
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,540
level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> assurance three so for this for</font>

400
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,790
this case let's say for something that

401
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,639
is a bit more secure and this can be

402
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,760
also chosen at the service friday level

403
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,250
v depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what security they</font>

404
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,129
require we can request the different

405
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:57,370
level of assurance that we need so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

406
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,410
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine to first log into service</font>

407
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,969
friday oh we're just clicking<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

408
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,000
then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font>

409
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:06,040
transfer of money for example between

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,700
two accounts then you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for</font>

411
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,000
example to enter the LOI<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 like</font>

412
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,649
this case so same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your</font>

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,210
standard login page for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service</font>

414
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:21,090
provider the only thing we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font>

415
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:24,669
is to integrate mobile connector

416
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:26,678
additional authentication please same

417
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:31,350
user experience we are asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enter</font>

418
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">username or user ID or phone number</font>

419
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,559
check on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mobile phone and on your</font>

420
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,630
mobile phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> you receive please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enter</font>

421
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,240
your personal code to authenticate or

422
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,820
perform the transaction and same thing

423
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you authenticate into a service</font>

424
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,769
provider so very similar user experience

425
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,289
with different level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security in one</font>

426
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,850
case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to click ok to enter</font>

427
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,950
and in your case you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically</font>

428
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,320
enter a pin code that you will have

429
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:02,309
defined on your on your mobile connect

430
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:04,658
application so next we have the

431
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:08,200
attribute sharing experience from the

432
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-user perspective so again the end</font>

433
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,720
user goes to the service provider page

434
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:16,450
clicks on the mobile connect button is

435
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,779
presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the page to enter is a</font>

436
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile phone as we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before check</font>

437
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:27,190
your mobile then enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> your PIN code and</font>

438
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,980
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity provider will prom to</font>

439
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,159
the user that if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you want to</font>

440
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,710
share in this case your email address

441
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,510
home address<font color="#CCCCCC"> or it can be on any other</font>

442
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,909
personal information with the service

443
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:43,389
provider if the service provider clicks

444
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:46,080
if the user clicks no over here the

445
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:48,969
authentication will still go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

446
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,760
when the service provider asks the

447
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,519
identity provider for these user

448
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,879
attributes the identity provider will

449
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:00,820
not provide those attributes if the user

450
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:04,360
clicks<font color="#CCCCCC"> CS over here then it will be</font>

451
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,399
logged in and it's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> open ID</font>

452
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,010
connect so what happens is the access

453
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:11,049
token goes to the service provider the

454
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,090
sub spoiler will make a direct call to

455
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,750
the identity provider to get these

456
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:20,019
attributes so here there's two important

457
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:23,200
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> note one is consent from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

458
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,559
so user is controlling what information

459
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,440
he

460
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:28,240
sharing with service providers and in

461
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,340
the service provider point of view the

462
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,889
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is coming it's vetted</font>

463
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,070
it's coming because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there has</font>

464
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:38,439
been a previous step that the the

465
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:42,759
authenticate the the the data that is

466
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:46,090
coming is authentic so a little bit on

467
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:47,470
the mobile connect ecosystem so we're

468
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,850
here if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see on the left hand side</font>

469
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:54,220
that's they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they that's the end user</font>

470
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:57,369
domain so we have the end user he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

471
00:22:54,220 --> 00:23:01,899
his mobile phone a sim card<font color="#CCCCCC"> on his</font>

472
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:05,590
mobile phone and an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application which is</font>

473
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:07,479
running on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sim card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have</font>

474
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,820
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hand side these are the</font>

475
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">different providers we have the service</font>

476
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,490
provider then the identity gateway or

477
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,139
the identity provider then we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

478
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,379
authentication service because it

479
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:22,149
supports a wide variety of

480
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:25,149
authentication methods and mechanisms so

481
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:27,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">the identity provider can can integrate</font>

482
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:30,279
with different authentication providers

483
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,610
and then there's the piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font>

484
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:42,279
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator which is the the OTA</font>

485
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:44,320
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> smsc connectors and as we saw</font>

486
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:47,289
before that the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

487
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,950
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> components take place through</font>

488
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:54,820
open standards so the service provider

489
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:58,200
talks to the ID gateway or the identity

490
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,119
provider using either open ID connect or

491
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,070
salmon which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already being used so</font>

492
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,740
far from service provider point of view

493
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,220
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to start using mobile</font>

494
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,830
connect then from the identity provider

495
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:14,010
to the

496
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:19,408
other indication servers that that's the

497
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:23,399
etsy api's which are also standard which

498
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:25,880
some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know which is already a witch</font>

499
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:27,870
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already being used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

500
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,669
and then we have from the other

501
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:32,070
indication servers to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile phone</font>

502
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:34,110
that's again<font color="#CCCCCC"> hcn global platform so one</font>

503
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,360
thing to note over here that when a

504
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:39,840
message is sent from the authentication

505
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:43,889
service to the to the mobile phone it's

506
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's within a secure channel even if</font>

507
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:49,049
this message SMS is intercepted on the

508
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,990
mobile phone say by a rogue application

509
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:55,500
since it is encrypted d<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gibberish</font>

510
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,620
so the in the it cannot be stolen only

511
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,940
the same card and the card application

512
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,539
which is running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same card can</font>

513
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:11,039
decrypt this so it's a end-to-end

514
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:19,289
security over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here you see on</font>

515
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:20,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see on the</font>

516
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:22,289
left hand side that's the service

517
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,659
provider page and the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side</font>

518
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:28,260
that's the screen sharing of a mobile

519
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:30,179
device so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side we saw that</font>

520
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user came and clicked on the mobile</font>

521
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:38,480
connect button and then he's presented

522
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:38,480
with this with this page for

523
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:50,409
so the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> enters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile phone here</font>

524
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,610
clicks on login then he is asked to

525
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:58,179
check his mobile and I mobile phone use

526
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:01,539
he receives an SMS saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

527
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:04,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to that subscriber the user</font>

528
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:06,429
clicks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and out of band the response</font>

529
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:09,070
is sent back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the identity provider</font>

530
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:11,350
and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the subscriber</font>

531
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:18,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's redirected in the SUBSCRIBE that is</font>

532
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:22,178
locked in so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same but level</font>

533
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,309
of assurance he where you know starts

534
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:26,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user experience is</font>

535
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:32,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user clicks on mobile</font>

536
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,760
connect button enters his phone number

537
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:42,610
clicks on login so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time instead of</font>

538
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:45,908
just an ok button he'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to</font>

539
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:49,149
enter his pin so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two factors</font>

540
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:51,700
what he has and also a pin that what he

541
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,500
knows so that is added level of

542
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,429
protection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's a clicks</font>

543
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,309
okay out-of-band the response is sent

544
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:02,320
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the source proper to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">identity provider that the the</font>

546
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,678
authentication was successful and then

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,299
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other the identity provider will</font>

548
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,030
redirect to the service provider and the

549
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:16,710
user is logged in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now is a twist</font>

550
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:19,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen some example and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key zisa of</font>

mobile connector as well as we user

00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:26,049
experience let's talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its</font>

553
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:31,230
ranjitha of deploying a mobile mobile

connect so 110 first challenges is a

555
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:39,760
deployment deployment so mobile

556

connector in factor either is using or

557
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,980
can use some applications that are

558
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:47,740
running on the sink<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that is running</font>

559
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile phone so in order to</font>

560
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:54,260
deploy your booze application of 12

561

who's sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> cards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mobile phone with</font>

well connect application we are some

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,180
either application loading and

564
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,450
preparation that needs to be done either

565
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:08,090
in factories for deploying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trickum</font>

air through the networker of telecom

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,470
take on Twitter so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

569
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,649
main when one of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges is</font>

to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users are deployed and</font>

571
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:26,240
I've use a mobile connect capable

572
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,610
application on your device we are after

573
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,550
some ways to mitigate that because in

574
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:34,429
fact with mobile connector the

575
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,950
technology underneath is a completely

576
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,430
done for service provider as because as

577
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,950
we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's based on level of assurance</font>

578
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:47,240
and not on the technologies that are

579
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:50,630
underneath so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> there can be usage</font>

580
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,550
for service friday off let's say the

581
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,920
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of assurance regardless of</font>

582
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different technology that can be</font>

583
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,400
deployed within a tree comprate or

584
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,650
within multiple telecom operators then

585
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,880
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second second level changes</font>

586
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:11,390
either the let's say onboarding of

587
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,980
service provider / Treecko operator so

588
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,230
it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a chicken and egg</font>

589
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,400
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you need to have a lot of</font>

590
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:21,500
service provider to make a service

591
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,690
attractive for end user and for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

592
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,850
use them but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time in order</font>

593
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:31,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> unboard service right there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

594
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:33,199
to have been let's say a population of

595
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,970
end-user<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use this service that is</font>

596
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,220
wide enough so that it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

597
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:40,760
service provider to to deploy you to

598
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,840
deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> this service so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 good aspect is</font>

599
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo specification are coming from</font>

600
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,500
the GSM Association which is the

601
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,580
association of telecom operators the

602
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,640
street groups all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

603
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere around the world and</font>

604
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,520
basically they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pushing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly for</font>

605
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,460
that so from the telecom standpoint

606
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,740
operator that's something that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">pushing to know that we deploy at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">country's level at a minimum and</font>

609
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,020
worldwide obviously and for service

610
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,290
friday what

611
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,660
been in order to mitigate the

612
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:15,730
difficulties of onboarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that why GSM</font>

613
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:19,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Association and the mobile connect is</font>

614
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:22,150
using standard like open ID connect or

615
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,650
somewhere that are things that are

616
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,980
already existing that are already

617
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:29,470
deployed for some service friday<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doctor not some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new preparatory</font>

620
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:38,169
deployment for service service friday

621
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,700
and providing also package and

622
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,470
documentation everything that's

623
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:47,640
frequently<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a service provider to be</font>

00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:47,640
easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boarded in within a resolution</font>

625
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's four main the main</font>

626
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:00,900
challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a deployment of the</font>

627
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:04,330
solution now just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to took up with a</font>

628
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,670
conclusion so as we discussed in the

629
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,960
beginning today when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to give a</font>

630
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,570
phone call and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take my phone and</font>

631
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,330
press the button very simple very easy

632
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:16,480
user experience in the digital world is

633
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:19,360
not it's not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so what mobile</font>

634
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,850
connector is bringing is basically the

635
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,520
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a same type of user experience</font>

636
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:28,959
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have convenience but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

637
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:32,220
same time you are also security so with

638
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,550
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile mobile connect solution</font>

639
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:41,700
service friday will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able in a</font>

640
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:45,730
consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> many manner and to to provide</font>

641
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,930
12 and to use secret services for

642
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,240
authentication and also signing up user

643
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,160
while having the user being in control

644
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,640
of where his credential are being used

645
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,680
and where is when his information is

646
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,980
being shared or not and to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

647
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:06,910
of that so in some in some super<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is</font>

648
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:09,190
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> like simple and consistent user</font>

649
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,470
experience across different service

650
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:17,040
friday regardless was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology and</font>

651
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">on and that's that's it</font>

652
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:29,170
anybody have any questions hi mike

653
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,540
schwartz from glue<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had a question</font>

654
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:34,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level of assurance 3 that you</font>

655
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,899
mentioned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nist guidelines for Loa</font>

656
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,850
three say that you have to identity

657
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,030
proof the person which means an

658
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:45,520
in-person identity proofing level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 also</font>

659
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">says that you need to check that the</font>

660
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">credentials shone like the driver's</font>

661
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,050
license<font color="#E5E5E5"> or passport you have to check</font>

662
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:55,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the issuer of that lot of that</font>

663
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,639
credential that it's still valid so is

664
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,760
your framework for authentication going

665
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,830
to include mandatory identity proofing

666
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:09,940
requirements and if not how can you say

667
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:12,040
it's Loa 30 C so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are from this</font>

668
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,970
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the from the mobile</font>

669
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,879
connect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with gsm a in velora in the</font>

670
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:22,180
elbow is free used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GSMA</font>

671
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,670
so the telecom operators are already

672
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,350
going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some identity proofing and</font>

673
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:31,090
rating of information as part of

674
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,939
requesting you as a subscriber to get an

675
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,820
account in their premises and so on so

676
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,740
that's one I one piece after we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

677
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,439
could be some additional mechanisms that

678
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,750
can be added but i believe it was mostly

679
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,290
for level of assurance for where you

680
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,620
have very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more stringent it's a</font>

681
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:54,360
government documentation verification

682
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,360
for that that matter

683
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,250
another another point on that question

684
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,350
so there's two things over here one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

685
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,660
the registration process where the user

686
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,310
is registered with the service and then

687
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,920
the other which we showed over here is

688
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,840
the usage of the authentication or the

689
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,600
usage of the process over here there is

690
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,860
no you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said validation of</font>

691
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:19,259
the document but when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user signs up</font>

692
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,760
with the service say for a bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

693
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:25,740
here as it goes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> register at that</font>

694
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:28,889
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wedding of his you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

695
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:38,600
documents or identity will be done so

696
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:38,600
once the user is registered thank you

697
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,879
unless saying the u.s. 80<font color="#E5E5E5"> III and it</font>

698
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:49,889
says you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chaplain's evaluation</font>

699
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:52,319
petrol so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that</font>

700
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,330
assurance to the relying party you have

701
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to maybe put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your legal framework a</font>

702
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:58,710
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says if you're going to</font>

703
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,540
surface this long way three you have to

704
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:09,980
have to do what it says which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

705
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is Valerie the first is that when you</font>

706
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,000
register your account at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMA no not</font>

707
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,950
on the service provider but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mno</font>

708
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,540
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mno is eating using you</font>

709
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,609
either form so when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

710
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,250
identity tied to the sim which is inside

711
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,690
your phone there is some wedding which

712
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,700
is going on over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so that's one</font>

713
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:31,950
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second is that when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

714
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LOA which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gsma is proposing and the</font>

715
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,299
level of assurance which is coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

716
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,570
nest they're two separate things so the

717
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,790
same rules which applied to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LOA 3 of</font>

718
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,740
nest may not apply to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> missing</font>

719
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:45,990
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they essentially defined their</font>

720
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:55,040
own mechanism or what they treat as LOL

721
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">three a more questions</font>

722
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:02,089
so what's the level of adoption of this

723
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:07,578
technology right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now by the service</font>

724
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:10,339
providers now right now the

725
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:13,219
specification<font color="#CCCCCC"> says 'no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenna said the</font>

726
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:16,160
specification came out in a february2014

727
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:20,709
so it's from a standard standpoint and

728
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,058
this type of world isa sa pretty recent

729
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:25,339
so we are some deployment that are

730
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:29,209
already in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place and some the town going</font>

731
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the GSMA association website can</font>

732
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:34,459
also have a list of few countries that

733
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:39,459
radius deployed some solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

734
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:42,979
mobile connect or similar solutions I

735
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:44,629
don't Russa<font color="#E5E5E5"> movoto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side somewhere on</font>

736
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:48,200
going to premier account free talk about

737
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:51,709
it in public<font color="#CCCCCC"> beta yeah some very strong</font>

738
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,930
push from the gsm association to to

739
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:56,839
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to deposit and what we see is</font>

740
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:58,098
that PR countries telecom operators are

741
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,759
getting to give you up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide these</font>

742
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:00,759
observations

743
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:11,400
I have questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Loa also but I'll</font>

744
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,830
circle back because I come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a NIST</font>

745
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,720
background for and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> L away for you</font>

746
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:18,270
show up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> person but that's another one</font>

747
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,669
but my real question is about sim swap

748
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,980
fraud that doesn't have so much here in

749
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US but in other countries and how do</font>

750
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:31,650
you prevent sim swap fraud<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so yes</font>

751
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,960
so in the case of sim swap so when you

752
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:37,050
register for mobile connector at your

753
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,570
telecom operator as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't went into</font>

754
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,550
detail but very the registration process

755
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:45,000
where some credentials are going to be

756
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,920
installed on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIM card application</font>

757
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,260
or they will have been done already in

758
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,960
factories so when you do a sim swap at

759
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,500
that point your telecom operators is

760
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,680
going to be aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sim swap so we</font>

761
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,050
mobile connect get your register for I

762
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,819
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooperate ave we know that know</font>

763
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,320
you've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sim swap so you have a</font>

764
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,170
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> sim card on your phone</font>

765
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,520
associated with your phone number and

766
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:11,340
the credentials that you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously</font>

767
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,370
are not valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore will be discarded</font>

768
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to either reregister</font>

769
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:20,279
again to your telecom operator in order

770
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,589
to reenter<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example the pin code that</font>

771
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,890
is used for a level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> assurance free</font>

772
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,620
and thus also could be depending on

773
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:31,680
service provider or some use cases it's

774
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,330
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side spreader of</font>

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,220
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this type of event</font>

trigger and registration or<font color="#CCCCCC"> an linking</font>

782
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,629
let's say of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mobile conectar con</font>

783
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,460
rhythm that this kind of things are also

784
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:00,570
part of it today in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM a</font>

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,220
specification in a well connect

specification they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> specified that</font>

787
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,890
yes sim swap is a part of the life cycle

788
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,950
use case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not going yet into the</font>

789
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:13,049
detail of all we want to manage it today

790
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:15,149
we talked about unregistering a user

791
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">underling the user</font>

792
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:21,450
himself again instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of working in</font>

793
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:29,130
progress for his specification we<font color="#CCCCCC"> re</font>

794
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on Boozer so what's the business</font>

795
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,630
model for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this who's going to pay the</font>

796
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,890
RPS the service providers how does this

797
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:42,000
house why would a service provider

798
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:44,430
deployed us so the business one that I

799
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">think would be varying depending on</font>

800
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:52,049
probably countries and also a types of

801
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:55,470
service friday so today business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

802
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:58,380
maybe that either in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries the</font>

803
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:02,220
end user will pay for it or could be

804
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:06,210
service provider paying all so far for

805
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,100
the service it depends what is the issue

806
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,480
i tried they are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at force on</font>

807
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">sites right there we want to provide</font>

808
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,680
additional securities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want the</font>

unusual to pay freight for some

810
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,740
oversized right there we value the

<font color="#E5E5E5">attributes of a personal information we</font>

814
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,259
getting let's say kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weighted pass</font>

815
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,300
on information from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on burrito</font>

816
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,610
in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size right there will</font>

817
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">be one paying for it so there's not one</font>

consumer yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to a service provider</font>

822
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:05,569
as well depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this case our</font>

823
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:05,569
plea and the size friday is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

824
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:17,069
does this have any dependency on the ECM

825
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:20,690
initiator so in fact this mobile connect

826
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:25,049
application can be deployed on values

827
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:28,829
let's say seem easy more secure element

828
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:38,119
that can be on a noble fun okay cool

829
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:38,119
thank more questions
