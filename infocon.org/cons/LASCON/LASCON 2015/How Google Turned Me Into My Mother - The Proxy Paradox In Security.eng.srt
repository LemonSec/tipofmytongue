00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,570
to put a USB stick from it that I gave

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,760
him into his laptop I said can I just

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,650
borrow your laptop to do you know my

there that's crazy so for those of you

who saw Kelly's talk right before mine I

12
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,650
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about it and I think</font>

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the the great points that she</font>

00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,120
made is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are kinetic</font>

15
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,679
consequences to security that a lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">us don't even think about or don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,250
online security you know if you the

information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be compromised</font>

would either be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the military and you</font>

know if you're not anywhere near there

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,470
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if its banks it's</font>

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,130
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to get more excited about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of cows and stuff like that but there</font>

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,479
still are other consequences of leaking

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,480
this sort of information it's not just

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,400
journalists its people every day who you

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,530
know have don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">being tracked to a hidden domestic</font>

shelter and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and the</font>

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,840
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this is another</font>

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,510
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consumers that you wouldn't</font>

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know it's broadened out</font>

38
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,700
to consumers and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really glad that</font>

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,940
Kelly did not use the you know the old

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,470
trite comparison of you know is that

41
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,670
something your mother could use or

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,250
something your mother could understand

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tired of that she's a mother</font>

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:16,050
I'm a mother my my teenager my oldest

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,819
one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unhappy to find out that</font>

46
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">his father and I were on the internet</font>

47
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,988
because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about</font>

48
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff we're the older generation</font>

49
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is ours I'm like honey who</font>

50
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:31,299
do you think note the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

51
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,950
so it was very disappointing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

52
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,209
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk today and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">start a little bit dry I'm sorry about</font>

54
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but i'm going to lay the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groundwork</font>

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,239
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Identity and Access Management</font>

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,400
sphere for the problem that that is

57
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,519
another one that I don't think is being

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,870
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough now first of all you</font>

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,540
know all of you pretty much know that

60
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,959
delegation generally implies that you

61
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,150
are acting under<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own identity and</font>

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,829
the relationship is clearly understood

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,200
that you're taking actions on behalf of

64
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,439
another identity but the two are

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,970
separate proxy you know it's a generally

66
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,760
it's supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me as if I were the entity that</font>

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,078
you were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and i will answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

69
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,230
their behalf so there's no separate

70
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,639
identity there's nothing clear that that

71
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,010
demonstrates that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

72
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:20,769
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever you say you are same</font>

73
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,849
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with network traffic the</font>

74
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:27,069
same thing in the legal world a health

75
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:29,980
care proxy for example if you've ever

76
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,929
had to sign one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those or get one of</font>

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,228
those or if you've been deputized as one

78
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:37,090
you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same health care</font>

79
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:38,379
decisions that the individual would have

80
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,970
done for<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves if they've been</font>

81
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:45,399
capable of doing it and in some cases

82
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,470
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done ad-hoc you know if you're</font>

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,319
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next of kin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

84
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,510
to speak for them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that will be</font>

85
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,970
one case or you may go very formal and

86
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,728
have a written<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care proxy signed</font>

87
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,949
and notarized although I know now from

88
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,290
experience that if you're in the

89
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,540
emergency room with<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody and you</font>

90
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,120
tell them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're their daughter and</font>

91
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,319
they can't speak for<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves the</font>

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,109
nurse is going to turn you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what</font>

93
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,328
do you want us to do so you know they're

94
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass any any lack of you</font>

95
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:18,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">know legal documentation but they make</font>

96
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,430
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care decisions which</font>

97
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,830
can be any sort of decision little or

98
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:28,060
big you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a very long period</font>

99
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,948
of time those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have not dealt</font>

100
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,130
with a durable power of attorney here in

101
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:35,740
Texas<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a standard form for that</font>

102
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:38,110
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are deputized as a as a power of</font>

103
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,980
attorney you can administer assets on

104
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:44,260
behalf of that person who signed one it

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,090
can be specified like you can do the

106
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,180
finances but you can't make real estate

107
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,729
transactions on my behalf that sort of

108
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,130
thing but if they don't cross out any

109
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,160
rights you are assumed to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

110
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,860
anything legal on their behalf and that

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">includes signing admission forms you</font>

112
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,860
know and signing leases in anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

113
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,770
that now the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that</font>

114
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,540
upon signing in the form it can say it

115
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,030
can take immediate effect as soon as you

116
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,760
sign the form or it could take effect

117
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,669
upon the<font color="#E5E5E5"> incapacitation of that person</font>

118
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,170
and that is that that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

119
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,820
really important point as we go along so

120
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,530
in the technocore<font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

121
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,599
know between proxying delegation it's

122
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,820
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> between everybody using the root</font>

123
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,460
password and everybody you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

deputized with sudu to do something

under your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own account however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

128
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,040
really clear how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that activity</font>

129
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,900
is being logged and certainly if you

130
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a piece of paper that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> says that you</font>

133
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,690
it's at some point there is you know

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,790
legal action or accusation of fraud and

135
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in a forensic accountant to</font>

136
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,060
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your records and try to figure</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person's behalf this it's really</font>

140
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,160
complicated when what you're doing

141
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,830
legally on that person's behalf is in

142
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:20,080
the online<font color="#E5E5E5"> world using applications I've</font>

143
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,780
talked Ashley here at last con about

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,870
about I've been dissing our back for

145
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">many years it's too bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> germanic owes</font>

146
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,530
not here but you know he agrees with me

147
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,910
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the generally a bundle of</font>

148
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,349
entitlements and sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

149
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,820
want someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have all the</font>

150
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,620
entitlements that comes with it and

151
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,380
sometimes they're only for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain</font>

152
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,050
period of time like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt goes on</font>

153
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,860
vacation as Matt does and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

154
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,450
be Matt for today but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for that thing</font>

155
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,830
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until he gets back</font>

156
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,529
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be in trouble if I make that</font>

157
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision on</font>

158
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:57,379
his behalf because Matt's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boss so</font>

159
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:01,009
and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all the time without</font>

160
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:03,439
thinking about it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old classic are</font>

161
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,059
back it was a group of entitlements and

162
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,639
they would map to your position in the

163
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:10,489
organization in the enterprise so if you

164
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,799
were a director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biscuit</font>

165
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:15,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">department then somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would create a</font>

166
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,489
role director of biscuits and they would

167
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up with the entitlements that</font>

168
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:20,599
belonged<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in the biscuit</font>

169
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,179
applications but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere else and</font>

170
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,279
and that sort of thing if you needed

171
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:27,409
more access you just added more roles

172
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,379
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm not on charge of</font>

173
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:33,139
biscuits and breadsticks so give me the

174
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">breadstick role too and then the</font>

175
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,409
administrators just have all the roles

176
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:42,169
because it's easier that way just just

177
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:44,959
give them everything so what's wrong

178
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this at least in the enterprise and</font>

179
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the start of breaking down in a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

180
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,429
places most particularly when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

181
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,719
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the texas education agency</font>

182
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,489
that first day they assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

183
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,369
either a customer or you're an employee

184
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:59,479
and you know believe me if you're doing

185
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,739
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the government you don't</font>

187
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:05,599
government you're not a customer who

188
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,079
came because you wanted to you had to so

189
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,419
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of customer the</font>

190
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,039
detective work is often required to

191
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,589
figure out why somebody ended up with

192
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular collection of roles why</font>

193
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,669
are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doing this well one</font>

194
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,949
time they had to go do that one thing

195
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,688
that needed that one entitlement that

196
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,129
was part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the role so we just gave</font>

197
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:28,309
them the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> role and we figured we</font>

198
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,479
take it away later and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot so you</font>

199
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:32,870
know this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messy thing that</font>

200
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,779
happens in the enterprise it doesn't

201
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,159
reflect the different axes of government

202
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,750
governance if you you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew</font>

203
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,849
the system administrator you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

204
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,929
said hey I got some chocolate<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

205
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:46,519
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me this role okay so there</font>

206
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,170
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot of stages of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to decide this part of the</font>

entitlements you're going to legally

209
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,878
cover us you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the decision</font>

210
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,769
to cover this part of the access and so

211
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:01,610
on and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't support context</font>

212
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,800
switching first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all if you're working</font>

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">for more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than one organization as we</font>

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,449
hadn't in

215
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,279
te a where you know they have like how

216
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:13,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">many districts are there now like there</font>

217
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:17,209
were thirteen hundred 1249 there are

218
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,639
fewer now than there used to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

219
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,199
yeah consolidation but you know some

220
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,420
some people would work for more than one

221
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,219
district at a time and there may be

222
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,469
legal requirements for separation of

223
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,089
duties you can't just<font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in once and</font>

224
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,920
say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these different</font>

225
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:34,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">things for these different organizations</font>

226
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,769
you'd have to log out log back in work

227
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:40,549
on behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this one log out log back</font>

228
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:43,309
in you know and switch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the union of</font>

229
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:47,119
entitlements is just not okay because

230
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:49,819
there are so many legal restrictions and

231
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:51,649
practical ones technical ones in the in

232
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:54,829
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that you can't just give them</font>

233
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,470
everything so I've spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time</font>

234
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:59,738
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw pictures of how to</font>

235
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:05,209
illustrate this what this really means

236
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:07,040
and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the way I decided is</font>

237
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,349
that you have an identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> authority who</font>

238
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,149
talks about vouches for who you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

239
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,939
why you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> acting accessing the</font>

240
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,519
system but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

241
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:18,589
access authority who decides what you

242
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,529
may access and this is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

243
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:23,779
where Federation often falls down

244
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:26,269
because classic Federation just holds

245
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:28,309
that there's one organization you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

246
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:29,929
to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your data there's</font>

247
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,730
another organization where they set up

248
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,999
the users and whatever they decide is

249
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay is just fine with you and that</font>

250
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:39,699
works in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases but not in others</font>

251
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:43,669
especially again where their regulatory

252
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:45,709
considerations at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Te aid no matter</font>

253
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,029
whether the superintendent's decided

254
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,939
that their staff could access something

255
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody at te a who was responsible for</font>

256
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:53,839
the stewardship of that data had to make

257
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,059
the final decision whether to let them

258
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,399
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not because it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be te a</font>

259
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:01,639
on the hook if there was a breach or

260
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,559
improper access or whatever so yes it's

261
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:08,029
a great idea to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 1300</font>

262
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:10,309
superintendents adding users are

263
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,929
requesting to add users because that

264
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:14,539
takes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weight off of the the</font>

265
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:17,660
central agency but it can't just be a

266
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass-through granting of access the</font>

267
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,640
roles

268
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,890
have to be checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entitlements have</font>

269
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,100
to be approved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then finally somebody</font>

270
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:29,110
has to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know take the final step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

271
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,790
be the fall guy if something goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong</font>

272
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,440
so the identity authority there's a lot

273
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">of talk about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people</font>

274
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in identity and access</font>

275
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,790
management oh god I'll buy you drinks

276
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,300
later I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry I'm really sorry</font>

277
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,130
because oh man there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so many</font>

278
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,569
projects and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fido</font>

279
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">alliance there are all sorts of projects</font>

280
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,430
they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how we you</font>

281
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,890
know create identity authorities and

282
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,540
relying parties and all that kind of

283
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,519
stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general let's just say</font>

284
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,709
right now that it validates you as an

285
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,560
individual you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is who</font>

286
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,439
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what your name is no</font>

287
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,790
matter how strange your name might be

288
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,920
yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a cow we're going to</font>

289
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:14,689
identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on for the Internet of cows</font>

290
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,360
yes that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cal you are a doctor you</font>

291
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,370
work you know here there whatever so the

292
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,410
identity authority you know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

293
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,170
where who you are but more to the point

294
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,060
it's about what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do because it</font>

295
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> translate you are this</font>

296
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:32,869
person so what oh you're a doctor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

297
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,660
now we know kind of what set of

298
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,920
entitlements you should be having so it

299
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really starts with what you need to do</font>

300
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,439
the function it's got to be bounded by

301
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,890
the scope on whose behalf are you doing

302
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,000
this to what extent at what time with

303
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,980
what systems in within<font color="#E5E5E5"> what legal scope</font>

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,010
and then there's the authorization that

305
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you know having having specified</font>

306
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,860
all this there's an authority that says

307
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:03,230
yes go you can do that so it's a little

308
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">light like a clue game so you know can</font>

309
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:10,570
professor plum go in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen with a</font>

310
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:13,219
lead pipe or in the library with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rope</font>

311
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,110
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making those decisions when</font>

312
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,350
you're allocating entitlements<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,360
somebody but we missed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a really</font>

314
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,449
important thing you the professor plum

315
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,339
is either killing or being killed in the

316
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:28,699
kitchen or in the library with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lead</font>

317
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,020
pipe and as you go through applications

318
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,529
especially if you look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font>

319
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,660
logic you'll find that

320
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,329
not everything is<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal if he's being</font>

321
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,110
killed in the kitchen he cannot do it

322
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:42,239
with a rope<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that you know that</font>

323
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,029
that combination of entitlements is not

324
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,759
available in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case where he's</font>

325
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,089
killing and where he's when he's doing

326
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kitchen so the combination of</font>

327
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,339
all of these things as you can imagine

328
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,800
leads to thousands of roles because the

329
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,120
set of entitlements is conditional based

330
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,459
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different factors</font>

331
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,019
again you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> business logic is hell</font>

332
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,359
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you really want to do all of</font>

333
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:13,949
the possible combinations for these

334
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,050
roles you know it gets even Harrier you

335
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:21,029
know being killed in the kitchen<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

336
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">O day and by the way this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the other</font>

337
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:26,189
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes application security</font>

338
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:29,339
testing such a pain in the butt as Matt

339
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:30,719
will remember because unless you tested

340
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:34,499
all of those cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would not find</font>

341
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,410
the flaw around being killed in the

342
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,970
kitchen with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> O day unless you know</font>

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:44,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless you followed all the workflows</font>

344
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:47,009
and set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that way so you're</font>

345
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:50,009
associated with the knot with let's say

346
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:52,949
a given organization and they attest

347
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,720
that you're you know associated with

348
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in the proper way yes you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

and they approve the functions that you

which conditions you're going to allow

them access and what conditions as a

relying party you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to accept</font>

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,800
what types of at a station you know okay

did check who they are you know or

00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a relying</font>

363
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,999
party you may have certain conditions

364
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:39,029
that have to be met before you will

365
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:40,860
grant<font color="#E5E5E5"> that access and you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beat all</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things at one time citizen</font>

student parent doctor-patient you know

368
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:50,810
these can be switched at the blink of an

369
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,270
eye under HIPAA a doctor's name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

370
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,010
confidential but if the doctors hit by a

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,010
bus and<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly becomes a patient then</font>

372
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,640
that same name is confidential so these

373
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:04,790
sort of things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen all the time</font>

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,340
and however<font color="#CCCCCC"> the function is in scope are</font>

enough to dictate what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should have</font>

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">be very different from a patient who's</font>

generally not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look up all the</font>

extra information about a doctor usually

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have dynamic reallocations of</font>

386
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,940
entitlements based on context we can't

387
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:41,420
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's too difficult so this is</font>

388
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:44,960
where we have leakage because those

389
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,760
accesses are static so now let's talk

390
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,560
about consumers it's already confusing

391
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,760
enough for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises but what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about regular people we have anticipated</font>

393
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,590
needs for delegation things we already

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,760
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do for example minor</font>

children they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have online accounts and</font>

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,099
parents are asked to approve them in

397
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,980
some cases I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

password and started just buying a whole

401
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,870
bunch of stuff I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font>

402
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,640
they did that but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it had</font>

403
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,629
something to do with you know she

404
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:26,060
clicked on the wrong thing then there

405
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,610
are unanticipated needs and these are

406
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:31,879
the things the big big picture thing

407
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,939
that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today first</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of all incapacitated adults and let me</font>

make a note<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that even if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

dementia dementia is not a one-way

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,440
down somebody may be very clear-headed

415
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,909
one day and suddenly the next day they

are not making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense when they talk and</font>

417
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,010
then they're better again so there's not

point ok we're going to you know

consider you incapacitated and we're

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing comes and goes again if you</font>

423
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,790
ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hospital for a month</font>

424
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,960
you're in a coma you're temporarily

425
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:16,940
incapacitated but then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

426
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,010
taking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the role of being a delegate</font>

427
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,490
for somebody takes time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bureaucracy</font>

428
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,070
if you don't already have that letter if

429
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,810
you don't have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> form</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's again</font>

430
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,450
there are some ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bypass that</font>

431
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,240
if it's an emergency but try going to

432
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:36,590
Amazon and saying yeah my mom can't talk

433
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,180
right now can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have her password yeah</font>

434
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,300
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work is she dead no she's</font>

435
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,620
not dead no she's right here she's you

436
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,149
know telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that there is a</font>

437
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,070
cheeseburger on her stomach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

438
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:49,430
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that yeah she's on</font>

439
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:51,260
morphine yeah I can't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> her on right</font>

440
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:54,320
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give it to me know</font>

441
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,379
that that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to work and also</font>

442
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,639
convincing somebody that their

443
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,480
incapacitated can ruin your relationship

444
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,450
with them so you know going back to the

445
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,650
whole thing about this does this proxy

446
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,170
take effect now or when they're

447
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:14,600
incapacitated believing that's not a

448
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:16,190
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to have so there</font>

449
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I T does not keep</font>

450
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,850
up with this at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example I had</font>

451
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,620
a you know on insurance and they have

452
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,659
online prescription management where I

453
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,590
could do mail order prescriptions for my

454
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,660
family<font color="#E5E5E5"> when my oldest turned 13 I got an</font>

455
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,520
email notification that now that he was

456
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,560
13 he needed to set up his<font color="#E5E5E5"> own account</font>

457
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,860
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to authorize me to</font>

458
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,760
continue to manage his<font color="#E5E5E5"> prescriptions so</font>

459
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:46,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need me to set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another account ok</font>

460
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,390
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I set up another account I used a</font>

461
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,030
different email address because I

462
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">figured they would check and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize</font>

463
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,460
myself and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to managing</font>

464
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:59,720
the prescriptions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they don't</font>

465
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,690
they don't have very good authentication

466
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,490
and authorization mechanisms of course I

467
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,440
knew all the demographic data I knew the

468
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,299
date of birth I mean you know

469
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,700
everything they asked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

470
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:12,470
so it was incredibly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so I</font>

471
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">just didn't I didn't bother my 13 year</font>

472
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,500
old he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was busy playing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simmons or</font>

473
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:22,009
something another example is setting up

474
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,620
an online<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some places where you</font>

475
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:27,529
can set up yourself or somebody else as

476
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:31,279
a delegate but then to revoke that you

477
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:36,559
have to do it in writing like what that

478
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:38,330
doesn't make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either so on</font>

479
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,668
occasion mechanisms that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

480
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,590
today assume a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things first they</font>

481
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:45,169
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the demographic</font>

482
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,990
data and you know of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you've</font>

483
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:50,679
copied down somebody's social security

484
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,179
number and their address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and zip code</font>

485
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only things you really need are than</font>

486
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,190
the name of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> first pet it's a good</font>

487
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I knew the name of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dad's</font>

488
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:05,629
first pet it assumes that you can

489
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,639
actually navigate online and again with

490
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:12,110
an aging population<font color="#E5E5E5"> and someone becomes</font>

491
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:14,149
less capacitated for example my mother

492
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,879
sorta lost the whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

493
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:18,678
scroll bar which makes it really really

494
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:20,539
difficult for<font color="#CCCCCC"> her to navigate anywhere</font>

495
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,730
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set up online</font>

496
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,860
delegation that assumes that you can are

497
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,470
in a shape to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to login to do it</font>

498
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,949
and if you can login to do it why we

499
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,470
need the delegation so that's that's

500
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">crazy it assumes that you have physical</font>

501
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,730
mobility and that you have standard IDs

502
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,639
there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people especially</font>

503
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,500
aging people who have to stop driving

504
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:43,820
years go<font color="#CCCCCC"> by they lose their drivers</font>

505
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,669
license they can't go get another

506
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,470
driver's license they can't drive so

507
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:50,990
they have to go get a standard I you

508
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,740
know Texas standard ID which you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

509
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,690
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> in line for at the DMV not going</font>

510
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen it you know when somebody is</font>

511
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,740
so barely mobile they can make barely

512
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:02,740
make it from their bed to a chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

513
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,629
back again they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DMV</font>

514
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,399
so it assumes that you know you can type

515
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:09,559
in your driver's license<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever it</font>

516
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:12,649
assumes that a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> email address</font>

517
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,869
equals a different person which is also

518
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty pretty silly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you remember all the</font>

519
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:18,290
couples who did the cutesy you know Bob

520
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:22,100
and Sally

521
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,960
at AOL com you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people to</font>

522
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,540
still do share the in the sorts of

523
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">things my husband and I were so tired of</font>

524
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,389
getting different email from our from

525
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,490
the school all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the moms would send me</font>

526
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,280
the mom email like the mothers of the

527
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">class of you know 2018 let's all get</font>

528
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,760
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> have drinks or you know</font>

529
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,280
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to the mom can you</font>

530
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring cookies no I'm traveling talk to</font>

531
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,389
my husband he's the one who stays home

532
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,310
so we got so tired of this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

533
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,250
created an account called kid movers and

534
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,720
you know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe that to</font>

535
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that had to do with both</font>

536
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,470
schools you know middle school<font color="#CCCCCC"> and high</font>

537
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">school so we both get copies of all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

538
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,250
emails and it works out that way so

539
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another assumption that is not</font>

540
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:08,060
warranted again phone numbers only

541
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:10,130
belong to one person if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're if</font>

542
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,169
somebody's asking you for a phone number

543
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's 42 two-factor</font>

544
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,040
authentication if you do the home phone

545
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,890
number you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of have</font>

546
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,710
problems there are some systems that

547
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,990
will use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to FA and give you you know</font>

548
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,650
call you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your home phone and give you</font>

549
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,820
a number via voice to type in but you

550
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't always know that when you're in</font>

551
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,300
the middle of the registration process

552
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,710
so someone asks you for a phone the

553
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,290
phone number you don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

554
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,570
they're asking you and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

555
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,420
there's you know you know cleverness and

556
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the security challenge questions at all</font>

557
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,120
and speaking of those this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

558
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,300
thing that really bugs me you know we

559
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,860
know we still have systems that insist

560
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,980
on when you changing your password every

561
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:58,459
60 90 days and everybody knows why that

562
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,080
is right yep mainframe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from</font>

563
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the days when it actually supposedly</font>

564
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,240
took 90 days to crack a password it

565
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,800
doesn't anymore you know I get a rainbow

566
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,640
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can sneeze on it and crack a</font>

567
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:13,610
password so but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have those</font>

568
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but what does not change your</font>

569
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,610
security challenge answer that's going

570
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,139
to stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the life of your account so</font>

571
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,090
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things where I would have</font>

572
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,920
to log into it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> once a quarter I</font>

573
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,389
wouldn't bother remembering the password

574
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,630
I just do a password reset because I

575
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,610
always remembered my challenge question

576
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,730
so again these are designed

577
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:42,860
he fails that you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to</font>

578
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about oh wow that's pretty awesome</font>

579
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:53,570
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that me I don't send all</font>

580
00:24:47,720 --> 00:25:04,360
right let's try this again sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

581
00:24:53,570 --> 00:25:04,360
that Matt what did you do oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

582
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:14,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright this is my dad that is his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

583
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:19,730
usenet format email address from way

584
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:23,150
back when and he also wrote a really

585
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,710
cool story on the story of Mel if you

586
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,240
haven't read it do take a look it's

587
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,679
still floating around on that he wrote

588
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,080
it in 83 I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about his time he wrote</font>

589
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,910
one of the first Fortran compilers he

590
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,799
worked for a corporation<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Royal</font>

591
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,600
McBee which was a typewriter corporation

592
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,700
that also got into making computers and

593
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,030
he wrote about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a colleague of his name</font>

594
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,309
email and the elegance at that time of

595
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:50,178
writing code you know in very small

596
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:54,230
spaces the elegance of using all sorts

597
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:57,620
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know very elegant tricks to do</font>

598
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,480
things so he had been technical for

599
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:04,399
longer than I've been technical he did

600
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,809
this before I was born so he and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hung</font>

601
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,540
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> on using that together during that</font>

602
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,879
era when he got around to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

603
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,340
1980s<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he kind of stopped wanting to</font>

604
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,410
advance he liked the command line he

605
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,470
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't want any</font>

606
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:22,549
silly GUI he hated windows he finally

607
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:24,320
finally years later settled on Linux but

608
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:25,820
you know he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stopped at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

609
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,639
where he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to keep learning</font>

610
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,649
more stuff so again it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't that he</font>

611
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,290
wasn't technical he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just he just got</font>

612
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,549
tired of you know all of the stuff also

613
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a really good thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't</font>

614
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:42,110
believe in security so I when he had a

615
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,270
stroke I had to break into his gmail

616
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,850
account and reset all his banking

617
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,170
passwords

618
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,449
because he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one paying the bills</font>

619
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,820
my mother had no access didn't know how

620
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,430
to pay the bills online so I had to just

621
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">go in and take care of that and by the</font>

622
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">way it's I don't know I wish we had more</font>

623
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,830
varied and diverse pictures of female

624
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,020
hackers because you know Angelina Jolie

625
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:08,970
is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> cupid I'm not Angelina Jolie I'm</font>

626
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,070
more like mrs. Roberts you know I I

627
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,660
can't talk type with an oven mitt but

628
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:19,830
you know I can do a certain amount of

629
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:23,490
other things so anyway so I had to take

630
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:25,139
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> his account because he had all of</font>

631
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,800
the the really important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

632
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,880
were needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support him and my mom</font>

633
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,260
and so here are the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need</font>

634
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about when you're taking over</font>

635
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,010
somebody else's account first of all do

636
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,139
you use your own login with delegation

637
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,540
if such a thing is technically possible

638
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,030
for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular site or that</font>

639
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:45,090
particular application or to use theirs

640
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,560
do you do both you change their

641
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,139
passwords when you take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

642
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,200
account or you try to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

643
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,240
it's a good thing that last pass really

644
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,070
cleverly handles multiple user IDs and

645
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,020
passwords for the same sign but if they

646
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,340
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still alive and you are just helping</font>

647
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,050
them out they may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ticked off</font>

648
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,790
if you change their password and you

649
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,230
don't know if someday they're going to

650
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,470
feel really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and sit down and say I</font>

651
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,150
can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into mine my system do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

652
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,310
reset all the security challenge

653
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:18,600
questions or do you try to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

654
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:20,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">name of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your father's first cat do you</font>

655
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,230
use your phone for two<font color="#E5E5E5"> FA or you use</font>

656
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,810
theirs especially if you were on the

657
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,370
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of the country you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

658
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,470
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set that up yes it's a</font>

659
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,600
great idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> FA is great my parents did</font>

660
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,340
not believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> two FA so you know I set</font>

661
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,530
it up luckily it wasn't a problem

662
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,959
because at that point I was pretty sure

663
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,970
they were not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use those anymore</font>

664
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,920
but if they had tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in I would</font>

665
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,830
have had to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it for them so I</font>

666
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,310
effectively locked them out by setting

667
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:49,500
it up to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for myself so</font>

668
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,480
the arguments<font color="#CCCCCC"> for just using their</font>

669
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,250
account first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

670
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,440
organizations to start set up to deal

671
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,059
with this yet

672
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,850
with the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you might legally</font>

673
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:04,019
need to do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have all the</font>

674
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,610
entitlements on their account doing it

675
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,429
the formal way requires their

676
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,740
cooperation it requires often physical

677
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:13,379
presence so i would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom</font>

678
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,440
into a bank branch office and show ID

679
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:20,070
and say yes she<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does want me to</font>

680
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,470
take this over don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom you know</font>

681
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:27,299
which is not going to work mental

682
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,679
capacity mobility notaries public it's

683
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:32,340
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you may not know this but they</font>

684
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,620
often have notaries public in skilled

685
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,709
nursing facilities because it's at that

686
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,258
point that somebody often wants to you

687
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:43,019
know sign a<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare proxy or a power</font>

688
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:45,870
of attorney<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something and so a lot of</font>

689
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,519
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff just happens to be a notary in</font>

690
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,989
case you need it because the patient is

691
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,750
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they have to come to</font>

692
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,820
them and there's an ostensible

693
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,009
separation of duties if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm logging into</font>

694
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,870
my banking account as me and logging

695
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,669
into my<font color="#E5E5E5"> parents banking account with one</font>

696
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:04,949
of their accounts it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear what</font>

697
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:06,809
I'm doing at any given time against

698
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,460
using their<font color="#CCCCCC"> account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know if</font>

699
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:10,370
the organization is not used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

700
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">they catch you they will block you and</font>

701
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:17,879
in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of I finally got a power of</font>

702
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,830
attorney and had banking my banking

703
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:21,928
account set up so that I could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

704
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,100
my parents banking accounts except for

705
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,889
one account and I don't know why that

706
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,570
one didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get added to my view but for</font>

707
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:29,639
the most part I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage everything</font>

708
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,289
but there was that one account I

709
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:33,508
couldn't see so I would often log in as

710
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:37,740
my mom to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on in that</font>

711
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:40,379
account maybe transfer money and this

712
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,870
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going on over years I would you</font>

713
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:44,490
know whatever whatever checkbook I had

714
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,500
the most access to at the time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

715
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,240
write a check for their expense it was

716
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,549
if it was my mother's checkbook that's

717
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,870
great if it wasn't I would transfer some

718
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,460
money from<font color="#E5E5E5"> her account to mine to</font>

719
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,370
reimburse me for the check that i had to

720
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,279
write one time I did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

721
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,129
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in two amounts because I wanted</font>

722
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,659
to keep it clear in the records<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

723
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:05,189
there was this expenditure for fifty

724
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,740
dollars and I reimbursed myself and

725
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,300
there was another<font color="#E5E5E5"> expenditure for 380</font>

726
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,250
and you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it</font>

727
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,010
all neat instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of transferring a lump</font>

728
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">sum but they decided that was fraud so</font>

729
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,030
they locked<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mother's accountant and I</font>

730
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">said well if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unlock it your</font>

731
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:21,870
mother<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to come into the branch with</font>

732
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,910
her ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say to unlock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well that's</font>

733
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:27,209
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen so I went back to my</font>

734
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:30,179
login and just used it to do the same

735
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,320
thing minus the now of the one extra

736
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,640
account that I didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font>

737
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,379
again the principal account order might

738
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,650
resent you for having to mess around

739
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that and the technical confusion</font>

740
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:45,390
can result if your application<font color="#CCCCCC"> has not</font>

741
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:48,990
been at all designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take these</font>

742
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:52,679
things into account so example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

743
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:56,340
my mother this is how google turned me

744
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,780
into my mother so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had for gmail</font>

745
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,090
accounts on my laptop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

746
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:03,860
managing a work account for me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private</font>

747
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:08,129
account my dad's gmail my mom's gmail

748
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,379
and what happened was for my mother's

749
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,140
account i added an alternative address I

750
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,790
added<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own home address as an</font>

751
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,670
alternate address under the gmail

752
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,920
account because you can do that so my

753
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,920
mother's you know real name narrow lane

754
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,429
aether to her her gmail account and i

755
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">added a secondary address which mine</font>

756
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:30,990
what happened was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out that</font>

757
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:35,250
anybody who is using gmail who sent

758
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:38,340
email to me Wendy at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nathan com google</font>

759
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:44,550
would very helpfully prepend my mother's

760
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:46,139
name to that address so and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

761
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,669
pretty freaky it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing my mother</font>

762
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,880
was still alive at the time otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

763
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,220
would have been really freaked out and

764
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,780
so anybody who was contacting me for the

765
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,250
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time who was using a gmail account</font>

766
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,050
you know I joined the board of a

767
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,870
non-profit they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna send mail to</font>

768
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:03,389
all the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of directors mine was</font>

769
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:06,479
addressed to Marilyn a third oh that's

770
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:09,360
weird that's scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's freaky why is</font>

771
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,429
this a problem well if you are Superman

772
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,790
for example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up an alternate</font>

773
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,890
address of clark at<font color="#CCCCCC"> kent com anybody who</font>

774
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:20,820
sends mail to Clark Kent<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm will get</font>

775
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:23,590
helpfully oh that's Superman

776
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:29,080
that's why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem this is a</font>

777
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:31,959
potential privacy problem so I I you

778
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,850
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacting Google about it I tried</font>

779
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain it with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this example said you</font>

780
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,870
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a privacy problem I</font>

781
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,639
told Rob Graham and it was like will

782
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,610
hold off a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes I want to see if</font>

783
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,990
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something with this but you</font>

784
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,100
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

785
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,450
this is the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's supposed to work</font>

786
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,409
it's you know functioning as design okay

787
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:55,120
like so you don't mind if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk about</font>

788
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:59,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">this auto okay that's fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know</font>

789
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,350
it is it is a problem again it's not

790
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:09,130
understanding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> two individuals may</font>

791
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:10,960
be administering the same account other

792
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:13,030
problems to address of course if you're

793
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">adding a delegate in an application it</font>

794
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,460
doubles the attack surface they could

795
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:20,759
get home you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get pwned and how do</font>

796
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you monitor properly for fraud</font>

797
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,030
especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you working under</font>

798
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,560
the same ID if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> delegation</font>

799
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,010
then you have an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log</font>

800
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,560
separately and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

801
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,830
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> some rules to you know investigate</font>

802
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,659
the or compare the the steps taken by

803
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,250
under one account with the other one you

804
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:40,690
know taking by the other account but if

805
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,210
you're doing transfers and that's the

806
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,679
whole purpose of having a delegate you

807
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,699
know there's some things that they they

808
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,720
have to work out there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

809
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:53,589
reanalyze your business rules how does

810
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:56,049
revocation supposed to work how do you

811
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:59,770
revoke who do you call at amazon to

812
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:01,450
revoke you know a delegate account who'd

813
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,840
he call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank to revoke a delicate</font>

814
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,490
account and also both recertification if

815
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,770
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and revocation</font>

816
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,729
assume that the principles any in any

817
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,950
position to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision my mother</font>

818
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end would get calls and you</font>

819
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,399
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody would be asking her stuff</font>

820
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,140
she she actually got warning calls from

821
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,540
the bank saying we've locked your

822
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,220
account we think there was fraud she

823
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,779
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even tell me who had called</font>

824
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,850
her because it was in one ear and out

825
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,700
the other she did not understand thought

826
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:33,670
maybe it was a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe it was a</font>

827
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,060
sales call she had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea a minute</font>

828
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,430
later

829
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,529
you wouldn't remember what it was so now

830
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:41,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing is another both</font>

831
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:44,980
procedural legal and technical problem

832
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,630
that has to be worked out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

833
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,840
course it was pointed out to me when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

834
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:51,730
gave this talk before that what I did

835
00:35:48,840 --> 00:36:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably technically kind of violated</font>

836
00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:03,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFAA yeah well sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so</font>

837
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">short term recommendations what can we</font>

838
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:11,290
do about this first of all get the

839
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,450
pieces of paper from your loved ones

840
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:18,190
from your parents and again this is a

841
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:19,930
really difficult discussion to have what

842
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,820
I really urge is that if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

843
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:24,640
get a durable power of attorney make it

844
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,470
take effect immediately you're not the

845
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,420
person who signs it is not giving away

846
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,060
all the rights to you they're just

847
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,770
allowing you to help them and it was a

848
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,240
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier when I got it with immediate</font>

849
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,680
effect to say mom do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to just</font>

850
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,200
help you with this one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

851
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,029
you look kind of tired and she said oh

852
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,669
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks and then I could do it</font>

853
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,230
it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

854
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,360
this for you from now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can't</font>

855
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,160
do any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because that's especially</font>

856
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,850
aging parents that's what they bristle

857
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,190
at so it's really a whole lot easier

858
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,380
just to say so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can help you in</font>

859
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,920
the future with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency at some</font>

860
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,720
point why don't we do this now and I did

861
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,160
this with my husband as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

862
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,649
ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drew up a power of attorney</font>

863
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,970
and with immediate effect and my

864
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,770
attorney said to me are you sure you

865
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,540
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that you know because you're</font>

866
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,300
giving them access to everything now I

867
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:16,090
said well if I trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> him for then I'm</font>

868
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,160
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust him now and it will make</font>

869
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,650
things a lot easier if I'm incapacitated

870
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,819
tomorrow he<font color="#CCCCCC"> can step in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and pay the</font>

871
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:27,910
bills get central management of some

872
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:31,270
kind get it ready so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

873
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,819
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you need to access and</font>

874
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,500
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll have to tell me</font>

875
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,730
you have to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and see but I think</font>

876
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,740
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the easiest way to broach it</font>

877
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,180
with anybody it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just if you were sick</font>

878
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,520
in the hospital right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you needed</font>

879
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody to pay your online bills how</font>

880
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,089
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it who would you want to</font>

881
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:49,788
have do it how could they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

882
00:37:47,089 --> 00:37:51,049
and just have that discussion I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

883
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:53,900
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> least threatening way of</font>

884
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:58,880
putting it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think something better</font>

885
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:01,640
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know longer-term what do we need</font>

886
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,559
to do again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

887
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,469
lines of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do in terms of</font>

888
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,390
explaining security to nonprofit

889
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:13,880
organizations or anybody whose core

890
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:16,038
businesses not IT we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

891
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,079
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a way that across the board</font>

892
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:20,210
regardless of what type of application

893
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,069
or site it is that there's a standard

894
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,769
way of creating these proxies or these

895
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:28,969
delegation depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal</font>

896
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:31,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements are for that application we</font>

897
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:34,249
need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to integrate these</font>

898
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:36,200
different worlds better the<font color="#E5E5E5"> places where</font>

899
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:40,160
you need to present a physical ID as

900
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,848
opposed to what you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do online</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

901
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,680
those combinations we need identity

902
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:47,749
authorities<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party trusting</font>

903
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,729
identity authorities for relying parties

904
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:51,499
to use for different things and again I

905
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:53,779
know some of that effort is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on now</font>

906
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:57,769
but they also need to think of it in

907
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:59,390
this context to for legal proxies and we

908
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:02,200
need better adapt adaptation for

909
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:06,440
disabilities in general we can't

910
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,058
disenfranchise people just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

911
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,890
know what we have we have accessibility

912
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:13,519
for screens and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that assumes</font>

913
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:15,859
that you can learn and handle the

914
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,098
standard user interface and you just

915
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:20,509
need help<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one area a lot of this you</font>

916
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:22,549
know more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more there's some things</font>

917
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:24,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can only do online anymore or</font>

918
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:27,140
if you're trying to manage affairs for

919
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,210
somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives far away you have to</font>

920
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,629
do it online you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

921
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,969
bank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably think of as many</font>

922
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">different ranges of disability you know</font>

923
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:40,609
as I can but we need to expand the use

924
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:43,249
cases for that sort of thing and again

925
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:45,979
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking away their power to do</font>

926
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:47,269
stuff it's allowing people legally and

927
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:50,479
technologically to render assistance

928
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:53,598
where it's needed for trusted parties

929
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:56,149
and then finally I think we really need

930
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,450
some some sort of concierge digital

931
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,940
concierge service to help

932
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,549
these people navigate these really

933
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,150
complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> airings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the legal and</font>

934
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:10,260
and the physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial</font>

935
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,930
everything else that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can think of</font>

936
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,250
and I've giving us talk and I've had you

937
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a couple of banks come up to me and</font>

938
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,750
say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were already giving</font>

939
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:21,390
our customers advice in some realms of

940
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,579
IT consumer protection and so on maybe

941
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,920
we could add this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that would</font>

942
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a great idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and something as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

943
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">as when somebody signs up for a bank</font>

944
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,619
account you ask immediately would you

945
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,660
like to create a proxy account or a

946
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:35,369
delegation account for somebody else to

947
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,670
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to log in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and manage your</font>

948
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:40,560
stuff for you in an emergency then they

949
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,270
might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up if you set that</font>

950
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,710
up ahead of time maybe the person

951
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,589
logging in might have to authenticate

952
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,940
themselves again some other way but at

953
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:50,609
least hopefully that person would be

954
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">able bodied enough to be able to do to</font>

955
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:55,078
pass that extra authentication hurdle

956
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,540
but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the sort of things</font>

957
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,579
that everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about in</font>

958
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:03,779
their applications especially if they're

959
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:05,060
writing them for consumers so now I've

960
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">done like you know a really doesn't</font>

961
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">really depressing talk and I'm sorry</font>

962
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but but it is something</font>

963
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:17,030
that's very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my heart I spent</font>

964
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:20,910
since 2003 I've been managing my parents

965
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Affairs to some extent or another going</font>

966
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,180
online going offline breaking into

967
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,270
things for them taking care of things

968
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,680
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> they both passed away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

969
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:31,200
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only going to get worse as</font>

970
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,770
baby boomers age and we can't assume

971
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know everybody who is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> young</font>

972
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,700
understands technology and everybody's

old<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't understand technology you</font>

974
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,589
know that that's not that's not a myth

975
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,509
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford to perpetuate so I'm</font>

976
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:49,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys as people who</font>

977

design<font color="#E5E5E5"> in secure applications just to</font>

978
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:55,920
include this in your in your use case

979
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:00,260
planning so thank you now let's let's

980
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,260
cheer up and have a party any questions

981
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,970
quick questions I spoke earlier on

982
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:14,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">occation and talked a little bit about</font>

983
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:18,319
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fido Alliance and they are strong</font>

984
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:20,690
proponents of using biometrics there's

985
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,849
strong proponents of two models that

986
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:26,390
they have suggested they're doing a lot

987
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:29,599
