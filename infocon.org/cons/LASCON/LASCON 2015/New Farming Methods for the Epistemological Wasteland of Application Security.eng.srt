1
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,380
yeah there was a there's some debate

2
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,439
about like how crazy this title is so

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,869
you get to see we'll see if we have it

4
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,540
unfold so we are here for the new

5
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:36,379
farming methods in the epistemological

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,879
wasteland of application security I'll

7
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to use the word epistemological at</font>

8
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,199
least a few more times and then we'll

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,529
reveal yeah we'll get to what it means

10
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:48,949
as we go through if you're if you're

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:55,670
initiated you can get the the slides at

12
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:57,709
bit ly /r do dash farming just to kind

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,860
of keep up with a farming theme there

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,120
and you know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab the</font>

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,890
slides and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,110
summary up front too so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

17
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,610
dude it's been a long conference and I

18
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,470
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to like check some email</font>

19
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,850
whatever like we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook you up</font>

20
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,840
with that at that time if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want or</font>

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:17,419
you know see I work at signal sciences I

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,880
am an engineer over there and I live

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,600
here in Austin I'm working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a book the</font>

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,658
hands-on gauntlet book I helped organize

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,270
DevOps days here in Austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I also</font>

26
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,159
helped organize last con and I've been

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,829
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in application security</font>

28
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:38,479
and DevOps and operations in engineering

29
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:40,279
for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while I'll do to to slide well</font>

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,500
one serious slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you'll see</font>

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
for signal sciences but what does signal

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">sciences we're doing application</font>

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,439
security monitoring telemetry trying to

34
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:51,740
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of data but we're also</font>

35
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,210
putting defense in place as well we're

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,949
making the toast application security

37
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,899
that everybody can use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like</font>

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,060
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that you gotta like hire</font>

39
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:00,950
people staff to like you know watch

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,340
watch the thing as we've done in the

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,689
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's you know I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,539
of it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way that you know DevOps</font>

43
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,850
really wants to go fast this helps

44
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:12,530
security say yeah you can go fast like

45
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,810
and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> hang with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and like I</font>

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,220
think that's a is it starts to help you

47
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,540
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a complete answer to</font>

48
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,200
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it starts to approach</font>

49
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,790
that approach our problem but because

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,190
Pete chest lock is here I thought we

51
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,760
would just simplify even more exactly

52
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do we make it like this and I</font>

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,679
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think like</font>

54
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,510
people riding unicorns would be like a

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing oh no like the internet is</font>

56
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,739
full of unicorn pictures and in fact you

57
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">can find even Batman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> himself right in</font>

58
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unicorn so in essence i guess the</font>

59
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,459
video is on so i don't know well but

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,230
signal sciences makes you like batman

61
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:53,480
writing the unicorn of<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so okay</font>

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,609
and also you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned you know</font>

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,988
if you're maybe you're watching the

64
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,910
video or maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like it's</font>

65
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,319
been a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> day maybe like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

66
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,790
debating going another conference you

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,350
will know now at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this slide</font>

68
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,929
whether you should stay here<font color="#E5E5E5"> or go or</font>

69
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,819
keep watching or whatever so software

70
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">development is a constant so i'm gonna</font>

71
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,708
give you the summary of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,660
it's a ritz of development in software

73
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,290
development is akin constant experiment

74
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">in knowing anything we an application</font>

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,019
security we we advocated hour runtime

76
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:26,269
responsibility and our development

77
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,730
responsibility through incoherent

78
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:32,920
philosophical approaches and we fostered

79
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,090
silo thinking kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how it hurts right</font>

80
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,480
okay there's a clap all right

81
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,299
like-minded<font color="#E5E5E5"> souls in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the room okay good</font>

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,798
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> security now is where ops was</font>

83
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,380
seven years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used to say security</font>

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">now is where ops was five years ago and</font>

85
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,519
then like<font color="#E5E5E5"> time just keeps clicking by</font>

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,910
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> where there are seven years ago</font>

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,850
we'll see let's not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to nine ops</font>

88
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,640
down a path to change through devops

89
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:00,920
security can make that change too and

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,929
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there's a couple key ways</font>

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,819
where we can add value but like three

92
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,620
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> where security can add</font>

93
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,839
value think we can add a tremendous

94
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,480
developed value at development<font color="#E5E5E5"> time a</font>

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,090
deploy time and at the runtime

96
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,399
operational layer and there's a couple

97
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,870
practices though we'll review as well

98
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,060
that i'm also going to be talking about

99
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,700
i believe that we should practice like

100
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,800
bad behavior development we should

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,210
weaponize our pipelines for continuous

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,150
delivery<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuous integration or</font>

103
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,969
whatever we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some sort of</font>

104
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,500
application security monitoring

105
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,910
telemetry whatever you want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

106
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,840
like we need something to know what's

107
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on run</font>

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,969
in our application in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the state to</font>

109
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually give us some information there</font>

110
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,650
you should also take some some looks at

111
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:48,469
things like continuous hardening and

112
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,969
auditing especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the DevOps</font>

113
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,889
groups maybe you find yourself a little

114
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">less app set but a little more info SEC</font>

115
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,150
I think that one's really helpful for

116
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that integrating DevOps groups that way</font>

117
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,679
and have an S bomb which is a solemn

118
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,240
just you know software build materials

119
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,710
but it's way better just say s-bahn

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,340
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well where where do we</font>

121
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,840
come from and really like how do we know

122
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,609
how do we know anything in application

123
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,539
security and like what's what's our

124
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,680
roots and and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we get here and</font>

125
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I'll just sort of say like hey</font>

126
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,320
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how we</font>

127
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,440
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prove</font>

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,159
it out in some overarching arcs of

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,289
software development and when we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

130
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,850
about it like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is epistemology mean</font>

131
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,010
epistemology is the study of how you

132
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,470
actually know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how do we</font>

133
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,450
know anything in software development

134
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,740
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> editing</font>

135
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,889
that's the sort of the problem statement

136
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,000
that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle or think about and</font>

137
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,289
this we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to walk through a</font>

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,180
journey like where we've gone through

139
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,669
out the I don't know we'll say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

140
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,750
last 20 years but it's also like

141
00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:55,940
interpreted through me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's not</font>

142
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's just like what I what I think</font>

143
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,560
has happened and how I've sort of

144
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,720
understood it and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been filling in</font>

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,669
the blanks as kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I go and as I</font>

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,690
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> older and I read other stuff and</font>

147
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:13,310
learned stuff so but I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

148
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,770
this this part of us that makes us just

149
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,780
innately because of who we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and kind</font>

150
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,810
of our human nature like we want to

151
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,520
optimize for what we perceive as the

152
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,370
probable events that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to occur</font>

153
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,919
right and so weak and in software we

154
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,960
have unit testing we have integration

155
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,120
testing we have we have all these things

156
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that really like look like happy</font>

157
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,970
path engineering right it's like this is

158
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,979
the flow that people will take through

159
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,150
the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is whatever 50 of</font>

160
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,680
those people want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flow at</font>

161
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,840
the same time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just sort of have</font>

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,120
like these ideal<font color="#CCCCCC"> states you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we may</font>

163
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,760
be like you know create storyboarded

164
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,350
users and

165
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,900
we you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them names and personas</font>

166
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,030
and all that stuff very normal very very

167
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,679
good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then we also have this</font>

168
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,140
other tendency where we like to optimize

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,050
for like all possible scenarios right

170
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,060
and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do but you</font>

171
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,920
still are left without what you perceive

172
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,160
but even up doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,950
over-engineering you you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,050
writing that scaling algorithm that took

175
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,909
you a week to write but then you know it

176
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,980
turns out your company like didn't make

177
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it or you got bought he got sold or</font>

178
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,780
whatever right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in a never</font>

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like never was was useful or you</font>

180
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,960
know amazon you know released a new

181
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,490
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like now they automatically do</font>

182
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,859
it for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you completely</font>

183
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,260
wasted your time right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

184
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,050
we like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think engineering</font>

185
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,450
like that speaks like who we are as as

186
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,110
makers as builders we're saying like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

187
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,610
want to do all this stuff right and but

188
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,980
there's really too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much there's too much</font>

189
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,870
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to to choose from in the land of</font>

190
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the possible and so we're still left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

191
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that whole thing we we just perceive</font>

192
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,240
what the probable things are going to

193
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,240
happen and we even if we're like really

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,410
like well are you know how you have

195
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your team that's like</font>

196
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,250
they're they're the real like Overtakers

197
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,990
you know and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some people</font>

198
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,210
are like blissfully ignorant of like all

199
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,620
people love our software right so you

200
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,909
can you kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> both paths but in the</font>

201
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle you know usually put those people</font>

202
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the same team and you know how comes</font>

203
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,790
here software but how do we really even

204
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,500
know like what we're creating in the

205
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,670
first place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

206
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,870
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's what we're trying to</font>

207
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,310
say that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to say here</font>

208
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,470
is the epistemological problem of

209
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:21,150
software development and you know as

210
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,640
part of this like we gather our own

211
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,340
rhetoric and our ideas and sometimes

212
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:30,270
data to to support our theories but we

213
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,098
like to have that you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

214
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,990
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all those areas and sometimes</font>

215
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,910
we do it through you know arguments or

216
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,340
we you know big<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel spreadsheets or</font>

217
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,189
whatever but let me let's walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

218
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,560
our like three major arcs are currently

219
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on in software development and</font>

220
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,349
like how this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plays together and</font>

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
how we can start thinking about how

222
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,340
secure you can can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved in that</font>

223
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,410
I think it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to also</font>

224
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize where did software development</font>

225
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,260
come from this is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff and</font>

226
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font>

227
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,760
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been learning about recently</font>

228
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,380
but we started out as looking around

229
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh or writing this stuff what</font>

230
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,610
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do let's look for another</font>

231
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,720
discipline let's try like who in here

232
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,120
whose parents are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on software</font>

233
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,560
engineering or even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a technical</font>

234
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,410
type state like technical work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

235
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,359
right like we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> like basically more or</font>

236
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,790
less like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first generation of people</font>

237
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
like working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this stuff so like we're</font>

238
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,650
like looking for model actively trying

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and in the 80s</font>

240
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the 90s is like a push to do like</font>

241
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,630
the big waterfall method and a lot of

242
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,450
that comes from its roots in civil

243
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,670
engineering where you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pour</font>

244
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,470
this road you know he pour the concrete

245
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,420
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> five million dollars like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

246
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,890
better be in you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like six</font>

247
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">months of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environmental studies and</font>

248
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,140
all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are required legally</font>

249
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,430
and all that stuff to make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

250
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,319
turns out like civil engineering is like

251
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,439
a horrible analogy for software because

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,970
like writing lines of code has nothing

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,340
to do with like pouring concrete right

254
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,770
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the switching costs</font>

255
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,690
for for making that is like super low

256
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">rights like it's a person typing on a</font>

257
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,730
keyboard but<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the way architected</font>

258
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,160
our waterfall so they're like the person

259
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,020
types of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyboard months go by then</font>

260
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,790
the thing goes deployed in it like now

261
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,160
the business now has to calculate all

262
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,870
that as a cost and because you made that

263
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,339
that whole feedback loop and the cycle

264
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,710
to actually get that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and run time</font>

265
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,090
like so long you've actually kind of

266
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,220
created the civil engineering problem

267
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,180
for yourself when you didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

268
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,560
to write is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does that make sense</font>

269
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">that resonate with everybody like you</font>

270
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,979
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good or like that's</font>

271
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,200
stupid if you feel like it's stupid feel

272
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,780
free like or or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever but</font>

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,180
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free like say something feat</font>

274
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,319
you have something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure</font>

275
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,270
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good alright alright so</font>

276
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,120
let's go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

277
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,069
agile first and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still holding out</font>

278
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll probably like change these some of</font>

279
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,120
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides and photos but i really</font>

280
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,040
like these because this is a shout out

281
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,690
to Sky Mall you know all these products

282
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">or SkyMall products that aren't you know</font>

283
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,450
we don't have

284
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,390
any more so as well that's what we can

285
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,190
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look back and and wonder why</font>

286
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:13,120
why didn't we buy these things while

287
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,070
they're available to us so first arc

288
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,080
agile and agile did a really smart thing

289
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,610
they're like great we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

290
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,520
like completely sidestep the problem of

291
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,680
having to know anything because we have

292
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,060
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and instead we're</font>

293
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,520
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this whole new approach</font>

294
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,349
of like just ship it like it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

295
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,089
get out the door<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

296
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">in front of customers or managers or</font>

297
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,800
whoever we start writing things behavior

298
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,320
driven development came through the

299
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,899
agile stuff which which behavior driven

300
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,360
development is really agile plus

301
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:48,160
feedback loops and codified that which

302
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> north he has this</font>

303
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,730
really great quote in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end it's like</font>

304
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,470
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we really trying to do and</font>

305
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,080
agile really typify this is like we're

306
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,660
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build software that runs and</font>

307
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,160
works and and tested but really in the

308
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,640
end we wanted like software that matters

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,449
like and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to fulfill</font>

310
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,410
agile taught us that we wanted to

311
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:12,130
amplify that feedback loop and get some

312
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:14,020
good sleep i guess and and then make

313
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that like we're showing that you</font>

314
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,319
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> our in-state product you know</font>

315
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,760
weekly or whatever and what agile came

316
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,730
out like that was transformational right

317
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,560
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh really i should like give</font>

318
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,690
you know examples of like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

319
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,040
working on not like nine months<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

320
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">dev psychol but i should do it like</font>

321
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,410
every wednesday or you know every friday

322
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,089
or whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end we have to</font>

323
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:35,800
realize that rapid iterations really

324
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:37,120
takes over the job of like having to

325
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,089
have like a complete you know thought

326
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">out wide plan and instead you know</font>

327
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:47,770
hitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> ate quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can't forget</font>

328
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agile is our guiding light that's</font>

329
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,839
actually at my house I don't know about

330
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,480
y'all not really actually have some

331
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,850
friends that just bought the Illuma<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bowl</font>

332
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,130
anybody heard of the Illuma bowl I don't

333
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,740
mean to derail us but apparently it's an

334
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,120
LED thing you can put in the same idea

335
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,490
but instead of be on the toilet seat

336
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bowl anyway see</font>

337
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,700
my buddy installed one and his his wife

338
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:16,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">hollers out to him Matt</font>

339
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,550
can lose on videos Matt Matt there's a

340
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,290
disco party you go oh it has light

341
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,240
changing modes she's like so there's a

342
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,160
disco party going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the toilet you</font>

343
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,870
know it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> like turn this off now</font>

344
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,839
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a big panic yet oh it's</font>

345
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,510
like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the morning so yeah so by</font>

346
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have fun with your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> significant</font>

347
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,330
other and yeah it's a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but ok</font>

348
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,100
let's list the world has changed since a

349
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:42,130
July come out right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't sell CDs</font>

350
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,830
anymore or software as a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

351
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,689
really we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete change like</font>

352
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,460
everything has changed last 15 years we

353
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,920
would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we deliver stuff</font>

354
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,530
the the repetition and the cadence of

355
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">though of what we've done so the way we</font>

356
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:58,530
distribute distribute our software even

357
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:02,710
the revenue models completely shifted

358
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:04,930
and that leads us to dev ops and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ink</font>

359
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,040
came off only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple days later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

360
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,209
really worth it and the good you know

361
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,740
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left that because a</font>

362
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,180
lot of times like I show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

363
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,890
they're like I guess that dude really

364
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,589
road to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops on his hands you know I</font>

365
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:22,480
was like man okay that's that's right I

366
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,770
fall you know but actually I was

367
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,540
impressed as somebody did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and post</font>

368
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,980
it on the internet you're like you

369
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,120
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people to find that but I</font>

370
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,130
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the Internet's good</font>

371
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,410
for unicorns and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> scribbling on</font>

372
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,930
their knuckles so DevOps is the

373
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,120
application of the agile methodology to

374
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,099
system administration that's like boom

375
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,870
that's the practice of cloud system

376
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,580
administration book by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jelly</font>

377
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,900
so there you go that's like the the

378
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:48,700
current Bible of DevOps right now this

379
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:52,660
is uh this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be how you</font>

380
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:54,280
could easily interpret<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps and you</font>

381
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,620
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just call a casual infrastructure</font>

382
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,439
which is the RF you're familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

383
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,710
history of DevOps but at at velocity I

384
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,870
believes in 2009 Patrick Dubois<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy</font>

385
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:07,090
who coined the term DevOps and like

386
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,980
started DevOps days and was is really

387
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,690
like foundational and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we call</font>

388
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,610
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Godfather lovingly in the DevOps</font>

389
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:20,110
community and but I guess who proposed

390
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,500
that was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok somebody proposed a</font>

391
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,570
session on

392
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,910
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

393
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,410
agile infrastructure and I was like this

394
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,959
open birds of the feather type thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

395
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,280
velocity and Patrick showed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like</font>

396
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,980
nobody else showed up oh it's a inter

397
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,449
Schafer right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Angie and and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

398
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Andruw Schaefer didn't show up and</font>

399
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,280
there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole thing and they</font>

400
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,480
eventually met each other and they're

401
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,760
like okay we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do this thing and</font>

402
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">they ended up having a making DevOps a</font>

403
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,600
thing so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was cool this is</font>

404
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,910
the slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people point to</font>

405
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,520
is like pivotal moment in the history of

406
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,469
DevOps if you kind of more from a

407
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,140
security standpoint but this is whenever

408
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,930
John alspaugh and Paul Heyman<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

409
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,449
velocity<font color="#E5E5E5"> same conference same time said</font>

410
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,979
hey we do 10 deploys a day and everybody

411
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,660
in the room was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like I cannot</font>

412
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,130
believe that that is crazy you know like

413
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,230
that's back when everybody was doing

414
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,300
like three month releases or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

415
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,480
releases and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole like</font>

416
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,280
multiple boys the day was crazy but we

417
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,050
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning like oh like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

418
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,360
this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lean and you</font>

419
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,839
have less<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in progress unless tected</font>

420
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,670
like reduces technical debt and then you

421
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,250
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using it and developers are</font>

422
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,599
actually happier because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to see</font>

423
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,880
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it and they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

424
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,510
build you know iterate features slowly

425
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,280
or quickly but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to like</font>

426
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,930
release so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> Big Bang stuff to see</font>

427
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,490
what's actually has traction or not and

428
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you get a lot of people do testing</font>

429
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,740
has a great side effect of happy

430
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,270
developers this is another like slide

431
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,510
that people talk to whenever they think

432
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">about DevOps is like Devils on one side</font>

433
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they had they had one set of demands</font>

434
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,510
and operations at another set of demands

435
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,130
and they didn't align and then we we

436
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,710
kind of have the current state of like

437
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,540
her that the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

438
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tip ified is like whatever not my</font>

439
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,430
problem you know and and we realize

440
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,810
that's that was kind of like key and I

441
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,540
know it sounds simple it sounds easy to

442
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">us now but at the time remember like we</font>

443
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,369
were we were struggling with like how do

444
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,569
we kind of align these two groups that

445
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:17,119
have been walled off from each other

446
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,159
they're desperately arranged and they're

447
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,530
there in adequately staffed right and

448
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,230
unfairly proportionately staffed so you

449
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,819
usually have like 10 20 developers to

450
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,160
like one operations person or one

451
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,050
sysadmin or something like that now

452
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,790
ratio you know more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> less holds true</font>

453
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's an order of magnitude thing</font>

454
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,820
independently

455
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,730
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> project you are or whatever but</font>

456
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,770
like it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 are</font>

457
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,990
going to have a flow problem with the

458
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,780
one right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not and the one can't</font>

459
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really do the work that's needed to like</font>

460
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,860
make the tens job easier or kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

461
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,660
part of the team because like yeah they

462
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,340
got 10 or 20 people you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

463
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,330
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff happen so it's like just not</font>

464
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">a not a very equitable staffing model</font>

465
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,169
there so we kind of see this as a

466
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,680
breakthrough like it joined people

467
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,900
around a common problem and it we focus

468
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,460
a lot in DevOps world about culture we

469
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about how we can succeed in the</font>

470
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,970
enterprise and this is patrick i

471
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,770
mentioned patrick earlier he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy</font>

472
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:15,610
who is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the godfather of DevOps but</font>

473
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,840
which would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate that i would</font>

474
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:21,969
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly so you know quote away</font>

475
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,770
but but he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he's reminding us like</font>

476
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's the only problem that we have</font>

477
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,720
like to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps work its culture</font>

478
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:32,560
like that's it period and that's what we

479
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,180
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really focus on and I still</font>

480
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">struggle with that like what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does that</font>

481
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,940
look like because it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

482
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,530
sometimes you're just stuck with like a

483
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,080
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are like not fun to</font>

484
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,490
work with you know and and yeah you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

485
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,100
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like well go get another job but</font>

486
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,480
like you don't want to just say like go

487
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,480
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> another job because that's like not</font>

488
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,150
a really transformational thing to do

489
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,430
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sort of struck me I have a</font>

490
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,130
three-year-old daughter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Julie loves</font>

491
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,960
the moon and and I like to think like

492
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,910
our house now has like a moon culture

493
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,670
and like way less spiritual than it

494
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:07,210
sounds but it's like it was like we were

495
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like full moon or whatever and and she's</font>

496
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,450
just like really excited about it's like

497
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,110
dad I see the moon in and I realized at

498
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,970
one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I now physically get</font>

499
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,709
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about seeing the moon I'm like</font>

500
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,660
sweet the moon is out like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

501
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,490
talk to Lydia about as I told my wife

502
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,020
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

503
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,670
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's like really cool like the</font>

504
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">moon's like just just a little bit or</font>

505
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,530
well it's a full moon tonight or

506
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever right even the big moon moon</font>

507
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,800
thing the other day like got<font color="#E5E5E5"> her out of</font>

508
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh let's go check it</font>

509
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,990
out right and and it was cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

510
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,550
started it started changing like the way

511
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,800
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about things in our family</font>

512
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:44,860
it was like mutual understanding we had

513
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,658
a new shared language we had shared

514
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,789
views on what was important to us

515
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,739
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> I downloaded an app on my</font>

516
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,119
phone you know and I'm like oh like it's

517
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,259
a waning crescent moon honey you know

518
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,849
it's like I could predict them oh so

519
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,259
it's like this even better rights is

520
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,599
like what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do with your your</font>

521
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:01,950
bosses with traffic or any type of like

522
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:04,869
metrics that you're presenting and so

523
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,179
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think like four for us to</font>

524
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,559
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about about culture like we need</font>

525
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure like we're aligning to the</font>

526
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,210
right vision to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right end state and</font>

527
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,349
and when you start making these effects

528
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,349
like these are the type of things

529
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:18,428
whenever you affect this area that's

530
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,200
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're winning it's not</font>

531
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:23,679
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping-pong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table or the beer</font>

532
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,970
beer whatever or like you know free

533
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,369
t-shirts or whatever like all that stuff

534
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,289
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen can't happen organically</font>

535
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,330
can happen from the top down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

536
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:32,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realigning everybody</font>

537
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,970
in the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of in this</font>

538
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,859
direction like that's when you start

539
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing the cultural transformation so I</font>

540
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,549
can't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that out like I don't</font>

541
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:42,029
want to like talk too much about culture

542
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:44,859
and you know through this deck but like

543
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,849
you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like like go</font>

544
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:48,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this list and think about like</font>

545
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:50,349
worry about where you where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sit and</font>

546
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,049
how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a difference kind of</font>

547
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:55,658
your organization in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area so find</font>

548
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:59,019
the move in your organization and help

549
00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:02,109
other people see it too I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

550
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:04,419
also look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps as a way you some</font>

551
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,619
people look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it real like it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

552
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was coming some people are</font>

553
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:09,158
like it is inevitable because the way

554
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've organized our economies like</font>

555
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,690
it you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

556
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:15,039
survive and to win we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

557
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,139
DevOps organizations that are

558
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,908
outperforming their peers by huge

559
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:24,689
numbers the DevOps the DevOps survey

560
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:26,499
State of the Union let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

561
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,539
high-performing IT organizations

562
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience 60 times fewer failures</font>

563
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:34,509
recover from their failure 168 times

564
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:37,450
faster and they also deployed 30 times

565
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:40,359
more frequently with 200 time 200x

566
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,859
shorter lead times so like it's really

567
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool it's like it's not ten percent</font>

568
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:45,970
better it's not like thirty percent

569
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:48,609
better it's like yeah its orders of

570
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,720
magnitude better to do this stuff it's

571
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you can see how entrenched we</font>

572
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,309
are in like the old way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just like</font>

changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we view the world like</font>

real line that culture is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

575
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,610
cool thing about this this survey is

576
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,710
that it's it's been verified by people

577
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,120
to do that sort of thing and like it is

578
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">like not just one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those we put a</font>

579
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,959
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> like little widget on our website</font>

580
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,059
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voted and now we have</font>

581
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,620
like a data it's like been validated I

582
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,918
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been part of like PhD research</font>

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,820
great great work on that and you know

585
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:27,039
it's it's not like i don't know if it's

586
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">like completely irrefutable but like it</font>

any of this stuff like the IT has

589
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,240
traditionally looked at for for surveys

590
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:38,110
like understand like performance and

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,340
value and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd hate to</font>

be affecting all these things we

597
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,309
sometimes like focus on out the

598
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:53,559
automation part or the measurement part

599
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,600
but we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be equally good about</font>

sharing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the culture of it and</font>

605
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:10,330
suck it right it's a DevOps is not meant

606
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:12,789
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way and I think that to quote</font>

Patrick again it's a you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

608
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,510
see see it as a cultural we don't see it

609
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,740
as a cultural problem we always see

610
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,658
those like a tool problems like if I

611
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,330
could just get those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys using chef /</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dr. / whatever a new thing we would be</font>

613
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,990
way better well like that's not really

614
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,340
true what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

615
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,990
like look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cultural part and then</font>

616
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,620
the tools can like fit in where they fit

617
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,960
in and some people would argue this is

618
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,330
not not another arc but it's just a

619
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,460
continuation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of DevOps but whatever I</font>

620
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,320
got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose the arcs just arbitrarily</font>

621
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,570
so there you go but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think continuous</font>

622
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,860
delivery has made a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact in our</font>

623
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:49,269
in our world and there's this great

624
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:52,029
little book by Jess humble and that

625
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:54,490
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how continuous delivery is</font>

626
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:56,529
so foundational and so important and I

627
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,480
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> him saying something like when</font>

628
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:01,090
I wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like maybe like a</font>

629
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,590
thousand people or 500 people would read

630
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,570
this book<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find it useful but like</font>

631
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,010
lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are starting up take this</font>

632
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,389
and read this and he's like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

633
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,000
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring book on continuous</font>

634
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,700
delivery but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helpful i had a</font>

635
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">chance to really dive in it one time</font>

636
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,960
when I was between jobs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

637
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">read through the through Edna's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

638
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,090
okay I get it now it's very I would make

639
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,620
a high recommendation to check out this

640
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,449
book and you can push pull out the parts

641
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,459
maybe they would be useful for you

642
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,580
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is kind of a large book but</font>

643
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,410
it'll definitely help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but long the</font>

644
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,899
summary of it is like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

645
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,210
delivery pipeline of some sort you need

646
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,040
to help you know make it make it real

647
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,990
easy for people to move code from

648
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">development all the way to production</font>

649
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,190
your goal ends up being you know have a

650
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,940
small batch size right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I check</font>

651
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,380
in one line of code and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

652
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,090
make that change all the way out to

653
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:56,470
production you know in in minutes not

654
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,850
hours or not days and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font>

655
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,530
people will object like they'll say oh

656
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,600
wait we got to have like separation of

657
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:04,350
duties on all that and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pci</font>

658
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">let 632 or whatever that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is six before</font>

659
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,370
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got have you know developers</font>

660
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,830
and and and production being being

661
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">separate but i would today the</font>

662
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,370
separation of duties is considered

663
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,040
harmful and and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably like an</font>

664
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,750
anti-pattern you need it for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

665
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">i actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think you need it for</font>

666
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">pci if you read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that third column and</font>

667
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci guidance I'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like pre pre</font>

668
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,930
answering that question but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that third column it says like</font>

670
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,740
developers should not have root account

671
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,820
on prod<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well bang like we can we</font>

672
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,320
can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying you give</font>

673
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,300
people route I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen you give people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

674
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,659
button and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole requirement is</font>

675
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,870
all about it's really focused on

676
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:45,730
developers making bad configuration

677
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,000
choices in a production environment well

678
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:51,220
like no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this in a pipeline makes</font>

679
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,630
a configuration change the system makes

680
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,150
the change right you check it into the

681
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,150
system the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system deploys it out you</font>

682
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,970
have a dev stage test whatever ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

683
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:03,010
have you want to architect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's</font>

684
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not humans doing things and you can say</font>

685
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,279
yet developers have zero access to

686
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,840
production and your

687
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:09,729
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI assessments going to be like</font>

688
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,049
okay great you know and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

689
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:12,820
they do get to push a button on a thing

690
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like okay people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are allowed to</font>

691
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,080
push buttons you know so i challenge you

692
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,489
on that and read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guidance in is</font>

693
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,168
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're super clear about like what</font>

694
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:22,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're really trying to get is it they</font>

695
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,099
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want you know escalated access on</font>

696
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:25,570
production by just anybody in the

697
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,580
company just to the limited people that

698
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,799
are in scope for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc i oughtta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

699
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,590
so i would say give power give

700
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,119
developers the power to to deploy this

701
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,209
gives you the benefit of reducing code

702
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:40,238
latency increasing increasing increasing

703
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,559
code velocity<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so i walked us</font>

704
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,609
through like these three arts we talked

705
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,899
a little that civil engineering and

706
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,968
you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like where are we going</font>

707
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:47,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this well hopefully because we're</font>

708
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:49,269
at last on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> security conference you</font>

709
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:52,389
see like i believe and i said earlier

710
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:54,399
like security is behind like we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

711
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:57,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> art like it needs to be the</font>

712
00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:01,178
security the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arc that that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of plays</font>

713
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:02,889
ball with all this stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anybody</font>

714
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,599
has anybody ever heard or had a friend

715
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:07,389
or you know whatever said like those

716
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:11,918
stupid developers like secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you we</font>

717
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:13,869
have this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like that's me oh no</font>

718
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">theres rehab available for you we're</font>

719
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:20,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna how can help you so okay you know</font>

720
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:21,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that say that's about right okay</font>

721
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">well okay who is who's ever said this</font>

722
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:25,509
about security right security prefers

723
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,979
the system powered off and unplugged

724
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:31,239
maybe ever heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right no something</font>

725
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:32,889
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he does have to be word</font>

726
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,299
for word I know engineers are very

727
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:35,709
precise write something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

728
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,989
basically security you care nothing

729
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:40,089
about like our actual world that we live

730
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,679
in in the business that you you don't

731
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:43,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">care if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we go bankrupt what you want is</font>

732
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,999
just like things to be like so locked

733
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,619
down that we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything everybody</font>

734
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,330
heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all the hands go up</font>

735
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:51,580
right it's like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the problem</font>

736
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you have warring factions and we</font>

737
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,570
have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are totally</font>

738
00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:57,009
misunderstanding each other developers

739
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,299
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not stupid there are some of the</font>

740
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,739
smartest people you ever meet there

741
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:01,089
generally the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually went</font>

742
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:03,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">to school for the thing that they're</font>

743
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:06,219
doing in their real life which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

744
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:08,109
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> about most security people security</font>

745
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:10,479
people aren't completely disconnected

746
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:12,218
from reality they don't they want to

747
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:13,479
operate safely to suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

748
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:14,200
would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather shut off a</font>

749
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:16,330
machine

750
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,460
it's like know that hopefully they

751
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have some desire to do</font>

752
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,490
computing you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they it's</font>

753
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,460
just like they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the right</font>

754
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,980
way and and is you like this there's a

755
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,710
complete cultural unrest between these

756
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,570
two groups and<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations part</font>

757
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,310
of it comes from we staffed our security

758
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:37,090
people around compliance and all that

759
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,980
stuff and legal things and so you know I

760
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,500
mean that's part of it I think that you

761
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,830
can't can't fight it and then there's

762
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,210
this really great book called the

763
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,840
tangled web which is all about browser

764
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,540
security but the first chapter has this

765
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,730
great little history of computing and

766
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,250
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where we've come from in infosec</font>

767
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,630
and application security let me read

768
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,570
this to you at risk assessment

769
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,680
introduces a dangerous fallacy that

770
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,240
structured inadequacy is almost as good

771
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">as adequacy and that underfunded</font>

772
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,680
security efforts plus risk management

773
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,610
are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is are about as good as</font>

774
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:15,700
properly funded security work does that

775
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,990
bother anybody in the crowd could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

776
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,620
could raise their hands if it bothers

777
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,600
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ok why does it not bother</font>

778
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,350
everybody like should like I would

779
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,459
say like this should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a problem</font>

780
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:31,000
all right let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it again who else</font>

781
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,940
was bothered by this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok a few more peer</font>

782
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,110
pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's break it down what are</font>

783
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,240
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying here we're saying that</font>

784
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,060
basically we don't have to do

785
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,740
engineering we just do actuarial science

786
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,230
stuff you know buy some insurance

787
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,640
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're good like will go the</font>

788
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,070
golf course or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to</font>

789
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">do go play video games and and that's</font>

790
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that's a complete abdication of</font>

791
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,590
responsibility it's like break a

792
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,990
complete break from engineering and and

793
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,760
it's a it's a really dangerous way to

794
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,470
think about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> job and guess well like</font>

795
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,030
the world is like not going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

796
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that especially as they figure out</font>

797
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,629
that like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it's</font>

798
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,900
like yeah we still need the insurance

799
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,800
you still need some some stuff to you

800
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,390
know make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're not</font>

801
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">completely like hoes like you gotta have</font>

802
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,380
the lawyers but like here we're just say

803
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,840
I'm like lawyers that's your problem now

804
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,400
right like that's no good like that is

805
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,139
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really horrible i really should</font>

806
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,450
bother you and i read that i was like

807
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">like and that really</font>

808
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,200
sets me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really upsets me that the</font>

809
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry that I really care a lot about</font>

810
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,490
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is the path that we</font>

811
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,400
chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take like in the mid-90s you</font>

812
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and and we stopped like doing the</font>

813
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardcore crypto algos and we started</font>

814
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,190
like oh like we give this rating and

815
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,500
vector and whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be it's</font>

816
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,300
like we just will accept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk and</font>

817
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,920
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pay somebody you know I don't</font>

818
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">know thousand bucks for you know our</font>

819
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,010
insurance<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy for that right now</font>

820
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,659
we're finding out all those actuarial

821
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,520
tables are completely fake and like we

822
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,720
just totally mess all that up and people

823
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,850
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for anything</font>

824
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,820
nowadays and everybody is liable and

825
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:02,030
even like PCI's like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

826
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:05,490
anybody's doing has had to do the recent

827
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:07,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">pc3 is like it's like you basically a</font>

828
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,880
test like I am completely responsible

829
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,280
for all my problems and like here's this

830
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,870
250 page document to say so and then

831
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,850
whenever you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefs like PC I can be</font>

832
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't do</font>

833
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,550
all those things in the 250 page

834
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,810
document even though they said they were

835
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and so it's not our problem</font>

836
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,620
it's their problem so like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

837
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,740
complete transition of responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

838
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,000
you and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to find</font>

839
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,510
ourselves like waking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to that and I</font>

840
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could have had like endless</font>

841
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,110
slides of all the hacks have happened

842
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the last you know five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years and</font>

843
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,840
about like a company's been breached and

844
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:41,220
all the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> but and then we all</font>

845
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,600
know like thats that stuff's not going

846
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,740
to get insured<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were if</font>

847
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nicky I'll breast talk he</font>

848
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,260
talks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how like the the insurance</font>

849
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,550
companies they could insurance and and

850
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,900
the way we're like you know putting

851
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,399
money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff is like really a</font>

852
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,400
reduction in money that's going into

853
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,890
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> or our pockets so but I make this</font>

854
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,560
claim that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where ops was you know</font>

855
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,480
57 years ago and I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

856
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,980
ratios are also true that like you have

857
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 developers you have ten operations</font>

858
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,330
and you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one security person</font>

859
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,430
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are these are order of</font>

860
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,260
magnitude and these have been all gained

861
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,990
by like my conversations with friends

862
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,050
and some some research and some some

863
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:21,630
studying but like does anybody say like

864
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,590
he's numbers really completely wrong if

865
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,750
you do

866
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,520
later but like these numbers like are

867
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:29,640
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much lined up with how we work</font>

868
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so the ten to one like is a problem</font>

869
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,580
but the hundred to one like that's a

870
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:37,710
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and so I think that we have</font>

871
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept it as from the security side</font>

872
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,900
you have just accept that no one thinks

873
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside of your organization the business</font>

874
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,950
that you that the security group can

875
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,990
actually help the business in a

876
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:50,760
meaningful substantial way other than

877
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:52,740
kind of like getting compliance or

878
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,658
getting some certifications or whatever

879
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,630
right like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have sort of</font>

880
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:01,950
like pushed security to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side and I</font>

881
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,799
think obstacle a lot of that same

882
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,690
pressure but DevOps changed that for

883
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,029
operations and I believe that security

884
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,190
can also change too I think we see

885
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:14,010
patterns of how this is already rolling

886
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,980
out in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> like look at look at</font>

887
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,990
the chaos monkey from netflix right like

888
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,570
that is wildly successful people like

889
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,039
quoted all the time people love<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

890
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,539
they demonstrated something really

891
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,820
important that average people care about

892
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:31,408
resiliency like people all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

893
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,600
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the way down to</font>

894
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,100
engineering to like everybody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock</font>

895
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,990
like what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with chaos monkey</font>

896
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,209
like I think chaos monkey starred as

897
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,340
like a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple bash script that</font>

898
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,960
just like deleted you know instances

899
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,209
right I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still essentially the</font>

900
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,039
same same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's not rocket</font>

901
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:48,120
science but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a proof that like the</font>

902
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,370
stuff we're building needs to be

903
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,080
resilient to handle like just a simple

904
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,299
thing like that happening and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

905
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,279
that it speaks even deeper like our the

906
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,600
human side of stuff like we all care

907
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:02,850
like I love that like I by Texas tough

908
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,010
bags like I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't buy like</font>

909
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,649
Vermont strong bags or whatever it's

910
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,168
like it's like we're in texts man like

911
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:11,668
even the plastic bags are like tougher

912
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,138
than things you would get out of state

913
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:15,569
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're</font>

914
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,099
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you go to heb I don't</font>

915
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,899
when I go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of state it's like people</font>

916
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what's a gb oh it's great square</font>

917
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,649
store ever but all right to go to heb

918
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:24,089
and you're like there's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ziploc</font>

919
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,159
right it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low it it's like</font>

920
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:28,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heb is like texas tough you're like</font>

921
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,690
I will take the Texas I you know I could

922
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,339
kick me out if I don't buy the Texas

923
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,050
tough brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but I think it's a</font>

924
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement of like we all really care</font>

925
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,879
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like there's that whole like</font>

926
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,319
rugged

927
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,598
concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like that's built into us</font>

928
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:40,918
for you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Texas and</font>

929
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,529
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know what kind of</font>

930
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,888
shaping the land the land as we

931
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:50,069
developed it but at about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years or</font>

932
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:52,279
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago our six years ago the</font>

933
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:54,989
rugged software movement happened and

934
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:57,660
Josh Corman and Jeff Williams both here

935
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:00,058
as long with David Rice sort of came up

936
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">with rugged software manifesto we also</font>

937
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:05,009
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> rugged DevOps there's there's some</font>

938
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:09,299
other movements like DevOps<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech and sec</font>

939
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:11,309
DevOps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> deck ops but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deadlocks people</font>

940
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:13,559
don't like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you add things to the</font>

941
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:16,619
DevOps and just as a little just on the

942
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,029
side but there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem passable with</font>

943
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:20,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rugged DevOps at the moment but</font>

944
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:21,809
we'll see the point is like rugged and

945
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,279
DevOps are both saying the same things

946
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:24,539
and like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of coming from</font>

947
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit different angles but like</font>

948
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,400
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security in the</font>

949
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,980
fold of DevOps there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple good</font>

950
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">talks at if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're could kind of check</font>

951
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,759
this out if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the slides and could</font>

952
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,490
be worth watching these videos but

953
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:42,299
there's how they do it at Twitter how

954
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,069
they did it over at Etsy and then

955
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:45,720
securities way forward is really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

956
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:47,460
out like both the development side and

957
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,609
the operations side I think that's where

958
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to start so let's review</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

959
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:54,900
some of the security things that we've

960
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,170
done over the last few years and and

961
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,849
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them okay 11 bad idea is like</font>

962
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,130
we had applications can be defended

963
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:05,519
because you know web app firewall suck

964
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,980
so let's do developer training right

965
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,868
accept it premise by the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

966
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,089
well as our idea so we taught everybody

967
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:15,240
like here's cross-site scripting and and

968
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:17,130
here's sequel injection and and you know

969
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,308
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> wah stopped to learn that stuff right</font>

970
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,140
and oh and then all those people like

971
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:23,849
pounding better job somewhere else ready

972
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,240
it's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like oh sweet now I'm</font>

973
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:30,029
not knowledgeable and more employable

974
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,519
but we actually did this weird thing

975
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:34,259
like for some reason we had this entry

976
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:36,359
point on the outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's</font>

977
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,440
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and then we abandoned actually</font>

978
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,848
knowing anything useful about the

979
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,210
runtime and just went straight all the

980
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:43,440
way to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side to development</font>

981
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,119
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still what I think</font>

982
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,320
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weird right but instead</font>

983
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,510
like what if we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding defense</font>

984
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,100
based on the pavers that we do behaviors

985
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,780
that we see actions are actually going

986
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,400
on attacks are actually going on like I

987
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,580
think there's there's some useful and

988
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,950
useful ways to do that I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas</font>

989
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,900
for how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it with some logging</font>

990
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,490
another bad idea developers can't figure

991
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so let's scan for vulnerabilities</font>

992
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,939
instead we kind of comes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

993
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,819
developers are stupid so we're just

994
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,230
going to like will roll this ourselves

995
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,690
and so then like the pen testers like

996
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,430
peace man here's your PDF and like you

997
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:19,240
know walks away right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the developers</font>

998
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:22,029
like okay and you owe you should always

999
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,890
just say I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a Python script or I</font>

1000
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't talk about gallant lady get a</font>

1001
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,859
gauntlet testers you know it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1002
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,839
want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like I can actually</font>

1003
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,460
run in my pipeline and I don't want like

1004
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big PDF like that's going to be out</font>

1005
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,370
how come in the engagement that's a

1006
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,250
little little tip on when you engage

1007
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,650
with those guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> but even with an</font>

1008
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,090
emphasis on a knapsack training we still

1009
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,410
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of made things kind of a dark art</font>

1010
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,090
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like back to like running</font>

1011
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,589
scanners and doing all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1012
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,290
like you know doesn't really speak the

1013
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,670
language of developers but really we

1014
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,890
should have integrated rugged testing

1015
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:53,770
inside of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pipeline all right another</font>

1016
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:56,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have is we have alignment</font>

1017
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,430
to vulnerability scanning but then the

1018
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">attendance II there is going to fix the</font>

1019
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:03,779
easy stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a man I</font>

1020
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,620
can't say any better than this this

1021
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,180
really great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but we still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1022
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,319
know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening we don't</font>

1023
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">know who's attacking where they're</font>

1024
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,880
coming from what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've sort</font>

1025
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:18,040
of kept that that out the real threats

1026
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,990
grow go unknown people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are writing</font>

1027
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,600
the code have no idea like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it's</font>

1028
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,910
being used in runtime like and we've

1029
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,069
seen in the performance world like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1030
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,509
is completely shifted like operations is

1031
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,610
like oh sweet here's this thing called

1032
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,590
New Relic or here's to sync whatever APM

1033
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,600
tool or whatever modern stuff and like

1034
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,190
we now instead of those alerts you know

1035
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,080
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting buried in like the</font>

1036
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,520
sysadmin is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thousand</font>

1037
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,140
thousand emails for the morning when

1038
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,670
they come in like those things actually

1039
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,400
go like to the people who wrote the code

1040
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,410
like novel idea right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took us a while</font>

1041
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,030
to get there in operations we're still

1042
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,609
not there was security but we we should

1043
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:53,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">do that we should have some sort of way</font>

1044
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,490
to communicate back like what's actually

1045
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,810
happening you know if it's not a full

1046
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,359
picture like there needs to be some sort

1047
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,349
of visibility

1048
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">there ok so another idea let's put in to</font>

1049
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,900
lean<font color="#CCCCCC"> then no one outside of security to</font>

1050
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,359
understand we<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do this in the</font>

1051
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,700
name of compliance and maybe we were

1052
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:12,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">like okay yeah we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to get</font>

1053
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,519
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> laughs right so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1054
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,989
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a web app firewall</font>

1055
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,979
because you know pci it says we have to

1056
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:22,249
and then we get it and like yes oh no no

1057
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right that's like the funniest</font>

1058
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:27,319
video I got so sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so you</font>

1059
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,119
so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are faced with that and you</font>

1060
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:31,759
were compliance oriented either as a

1061
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,079
security person you you went<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright I'm</font>

1062
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:35,059
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smallest possible</font>

1063
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,559
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like gets me check box</font>

1064
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,390
right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already had a</font>

1065
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,559
caching CDN thing something right<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

1066
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,660
there so I'm going to go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

1067
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">like modsecurity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rule sent on there and</font>

1068
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're gonna call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it good right and just</font>

1069
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,269
sort of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know me meet the lowest</font>

1070
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,249
thing or you chose the righteous path

1071
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:51,738
and you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in an appliance</font>

1072
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:53,629
that will block all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and and</font>

1073
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,369
then no one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hanging out with you</font>

1074
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,900
and it's like no one answers your im's

1075
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:59,859
or whatever you like oil what's going on

1076
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:02,450
here your slack channel is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> empty</font>

1077
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:04,999
and and here's here's a white paper from

1078
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,180
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> laugh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vend races</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every aspect of</font>

1079
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:09,828
managing apps is an ongoing process this

1080
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,660
is the antithesis of set and forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1081
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:14,450
technology that's the real point of this

1082
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,460
research to maximize value from your

1083
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,140
wife you need to get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go in</font>

1084
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,900
it everyone's eyes open when the effort

1085
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,400
required to keep required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and</font>

1086
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep the laugh Ronnie productively and</font>

1087
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,579
it feels really<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy you're like who's</font>

1088
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,589
who's actually going to take care of

1089
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:28,640
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual the business like now you're</font>

1090
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:29,960
hiring like you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1091
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,150
technology but then you're also like

1092
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,999
adding an extra people to maintain that

1093
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,859
and these kids are cool right<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright i</font>

1094
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:39,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">just realized that I'm running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

1095
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:41,630
long so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick up the speed</font>

1096
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:43,279
here so we have two ways we can add in

1097
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:46,069
value we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can add</font>

1098
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">value to devs or ops and then we are</font>

1099
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to just like hope some of the</font>

1100
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,900
business notices we can we can make some

1101
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:53,328
sort of some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like change that</font>

1102
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,059
would just like really really move us

1103
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:57,650
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what ops did it security</font>

1104
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:59,390
can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too like it's not like just as</font>

1105
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,640
really this dream it's really a true

1106
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,109
thing so start automating the security

1107
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,489
tools like practice bad behavior

1108
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:08,610
development putting things that attack

1109
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:11,820
attack your site in

1110
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:14,910
out of the build hype line i wrote this

1111
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,770
tool called gauntlet<font color="#CCCCCC"> gaalan is a bad</font>

1112
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:20,160
behavior is is built for bad behavior

1113
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,960
driven development it's open source it

1114
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,160
has it comes with a bunch of steps that

1115
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,780
hook attack tools but as an install any

1116
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,069
tools and it's part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be a good</font>

1117
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,530
citizen inside of your continuous

1118
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:35,100
integration pipeline the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> gamla works</font>

1119
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:37,890
and my really slick animated well it's

1120
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,720
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> animated really but really slick</font>

1121
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:41,640
design here is you put your code in and

1122
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,029
like different things start attacking it

1123
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,529
there's the animation and then and then

1124
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,940
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the other side and you're</font>

1125
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,590
like sweet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code</font>

1126
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,210
survive like the bare minimum of like

1127
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,310
just standard off-the-shelf scanners

1128
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,010
being like run against it and it came

1129
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,029
out without any problems like rats and

1130
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,350
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect we're not saying you don't</font>

1131
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do pen testing we're not saying</font>

1132
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,470
that like still good code rigor and all

1133
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,839
that stuff doesn't need to still happen

1134
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:05,520
but you've actually raised the

1135
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,410
visibility of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with your</font>

1136
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">application when people are writing code</font>

1137
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:12,120
and it's a really compelling thing a

1138
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,700
little more about gauntlet if you're

1139
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,259
interested it it uses cucumber it

1140
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,580
basically searches wherever it's

1141
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,710
currently at looks for anything with a

1142
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:23,040
dot attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> file this is one of what a</font>

1143
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:25,500
dot attack bottle looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1144
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,700
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cucumber or paper driven</font>

1145
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,700
development stuff if you used to that

1146
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,250
but you have a background step like the

1147
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,359
stuff installed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need like in map</font>

1148
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:38,580
here I have a host whatever I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1149
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,240
then when i watch the attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

1150
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,319
this thing right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the security</font>

1151
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,600
security professional or whoever knows

1152
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,580
what's how to run the tool kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of puts</font>

1153
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the special switches and stuff that</font>

1154
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:52,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">business goes right in here right and</font>

1155
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,730
then the output should expect this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1156
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,590
think everybody could read that

1157
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:57,210
understand it the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you're</font>

1158
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,910
taking the the wisdom and the knowledge

1159
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,830
that's that's set in the mind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1160
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,259
person in that under<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten one scenario</font>

1161
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,370
you're taking that and you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1162
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,050
federate that an distribute that to

1163
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,720
everybody else and you limit it to like

1164
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:11,520
one or maybe two lines of actual things

1165
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,040
and then everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is like</font>

1166
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,560
readable by a developer by operations or

1167
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,820
by security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay two minutes okay so</font>

1168
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,890
here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cross-site</font>

1169
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:23,020
scripting not in map but here look<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1170
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,609
for cross-site scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey using a</font>

1171
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,520
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we should not find cross-site</font>

1172
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:29,260
scripting on this page oh look you know

1173
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,450
we didn't find it and that's like that's

1174
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,320
a simple a really short statement on

1175
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:37,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give a two and a half hour</font>

1176
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,650
presentation and workshop on this which

1177
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,440
I've trying to convert into that the

1178
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:43,750
ants on gamma book but that is available

1179
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and if you're interested like let</font>

1180
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">me know I can reach out to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

1181
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,710
you if you're interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

1182
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,290
started with it there's the gauntlet

1183
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,380
demo which you clone this repo it's

1184
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:55,210
actually running inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis itself</font>

1185
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:58,300
running against itself already it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a</font>

1186
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:01,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray and rails go</font>

1187
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,190
plugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it we have the gauntlet</font>

1188
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,830
starter kit which will you know

1189
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure you a vm and chefs it all up</font>

1190
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,069
and puts everything on the box and I

1191
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:11,140
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it done by today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1192
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,030
hopefully by early next week but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1193
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have gone I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dockers which</font>

1194
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,910
rocket science either but<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm going</font>

1195
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put that up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the site</font>

1196
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:21,430
as well just write in the conference got

1197
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,380
me a little behind schedule so then we

1198
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:26,230
if you want the book it's on lean pub

1199
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then do that same thing but now</font>

1200
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,750
instead of just running them you know

1201
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,730
locally whatever put inside your CI

1202
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,010
system and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all from the</font>

1203
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,560
gullet demo repo but it's already hooked

1204
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:37,120
inside of Travis which is a

1205
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,440
software-as-a-service CI system but

1206
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,630
we've also worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins I have this</font>

1207
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,670
working in Jenkins as well in fact

1208
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,160
Gareth and I did a presentation and

1209
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,550
velocity with how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this with</font>

1210
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,790
Jenkins how to do it in Travis we did

1211
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python rails and we also hooked other</font>

1212
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:58,690
stuff in like a code signing virus

1213
00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:01,629
scanning dependency checking static

1214
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,920
analysis and and dynamic analysis using

1215
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:05,080
zap and other tools like that and

1216
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,010
gauntlet in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session and so if</font>

1217
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,299
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well I</font>

1218
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,970
could be happy to point you in the right

1219
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,470
direction on that oh so then another one

1220
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:13,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">is add some sort of applications</font>

1221
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,850
security telemetry we're monitoring you

1222
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,110
know to developers and operations and do

1223
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,220
that feedback loop and help increase

1224
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,890
that so if you already grabbing your

1225
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,080
logs turn your log stash stuff into

1226
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,129
stats d metrics so every time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1227
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,029
with things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like cross-site</font>

1228
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:26,050
scripting or they're coming from

1229
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,630
Skinner's or they're coming

1230
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:30,190
from you know some some sources you

1231
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,870
don't trust like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour network or</font>

1232
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,130
whatever you know pump<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into a</font>

1233
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:36,279
metric and then start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

1234
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,570
building that out you basically want to

1235
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,720
work on like<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time correlation</font>

1236
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:43,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">between things like biz ops dev sec</font>

1237
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,680
things like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sequel injection</font>

1238
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,420
plus five hundreds or maybe like we're

1239
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,160
seeing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of login spikes or login</font>

1240
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,750
failures or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that makes</font>

1241
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,210
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your business but help do all</font>

1242
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:56,200
that this is what we do at single

1243
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:58,600
sciences and pitch that but another pro

1244
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,520
tip is get hugs from the auditors and

1245
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,560
hardening and do audio config management

1246
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,230
you won't have there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source</font>

1247
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,700
audit hardening framework that has chef

1248
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,920
puppet against<font color="#E5E5E5"> will recipes already</font>

1249
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,390
ready and it already kind of applies to

1250
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,090
good standards over at hardening I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I oh</font>

1251
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,990
oops um head of slide over at Harding I

1252
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:18,310
oh and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run nightly audits of it</font>

1253
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,779
and so when you're when it's time to do

1254
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,190
like compliance you're like sweet we're

1255
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,510
like compliant like not just today

1256
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,920
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> checked the hardening thing</font>

1257
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:28,030
like we have like the last 365 days of

1258
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,140
audit records showing like how we're

1259
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,060
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and your auditors will be</font>

1260
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:34,089
like sweet this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is awesome like easiest</font>

1261
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:37,180
assessment we've ever done if you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1262
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,950
Amazon and I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread stack I think</font>

1263
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,660
they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> up becoming and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1264
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">good player in that that space as well</font>

1265
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,740
so try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse the trend add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> value to</font>

1266
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:49,030
devs add value to ops and try to figure

1267
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,580
out like ways you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1268
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:54,160
pipeline remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our summary so</font>

1269
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,660
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we're still trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1270
