1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,950
so just to give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little perspective</font>

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,360
I actually work at IBM as a research

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,830
strategies which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to go</font>

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,869
study things and I have absolutely no

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,299
responsibilities it's the best job on

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,420
the planet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the things that I</font>

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,879
like doing is I actually work with IOT

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,129
security stuff in fact it's not

9
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,960
technically my job at IBM i just got

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,220
interested in about six seven years ago

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">when i was running my own business and</font>

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,440
when I came to IBM i said look anybody

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing any connected car security stuff</font>

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,379
and they said no and I said mind if I do

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,000
and they said as long as doesn't

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,180
interfere with your job and now that's

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,699
pretty much all I do so the goal here is

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,530
or the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is if you like to do</font>

19
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,839
something just go ahead and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by</font>

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,269
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we were in a zero we're in a</font>

21
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:04,679
negative unemployment industry so if you

22
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:06,570
get fired for doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you like</font>

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,790
then there's other jobs anywhere so it's

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,649
fine that's my advice to you get fired

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">so who here has who here has not heard</font>

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,570
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris or chris miller and charlie</font>

27
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,850
chris valasek and Charlie<font color="#CCCCCC"> no a hack not</font>

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,559
heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you all know about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,270
with the interesting thing about this is

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,950
that you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they had the</font>

31
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,750
wired reporter behind the wheel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,670
they disabled the brakes and he freaked

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,499
out and drove it into a ditch and this

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,420
is what the media shows right it

35
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:37,829
basically is big big fear and certain

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,149
din doubt and oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god everybody's</font>

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,279
gonna it's going to be horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

38
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,060
going to be the apocalypse right so one

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,249
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,780
demystify a little bit about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

41
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:48,839
also I want to key on the work of

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,060
valasek<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miller for a second who here has</font>

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">read valla second Miller's paper all the</font>

44
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,679
way through so<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of you okay um that's</font>

45
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,999
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's just the reason I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

46
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,380
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually going to dissect</font>

47
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,568
what they did because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,249
interesting how they went about hacking

49
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,170
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car and then I want to show</font>

50
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:06,810
where the car manufacturers actually

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,850
made mistakes and we'll talk about that

52
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,500
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the car</font>

53
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,109
manufacturers mistakes who are actually

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,950
works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a car manufacturer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the first thing because we're</font>

56
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,170
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that</font>

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,819
so see the interesting thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

58
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,649
general public thinks about it in terms

59
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,660
of oh my god cars have gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

60
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,790
freaked out anybody here big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christie</font>

61
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,220
for Stephen King fan Christine right or

62
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,590
if you actually I like this better

63
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,410
anybody know what this movie is best

64
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">b-movie on the planet Maximum Overdrive</font>

65
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,540
come on people all the trucks all the

66
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:45,220
trucks become animated and they hold

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,120
Emilio Estevez that's all I have to say

68
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,160
Emilio Estevez come on so great<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie if</font>

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,989
you haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it absolutely bring get</font>

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,079
a couple beers on a rainy sunday

71
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,150
afternoon they'll be awesome so just to

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,650
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a sense of the threat landscape</font>

73
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,000
just from a general perspective this is

74
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a marketing slides but one of</font>

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,709
the things I find kind of interesting

76
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,170
anybody ever see this particular chart

77
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,730
so it's a number of lines of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

78
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,079
are in software in the modern high-end

79
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,510
car now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a hundred million</font>

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,790
lines of code and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just oppose</font>

81
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,920
that with an f-22 Raptor fighter at 1.7

82
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,480
million lines of code for most of us who

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,250
have done any dev we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of</font>

84
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,570
 numbers right really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

85
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">million lines includes a lot of</font>

86
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">operating system stuff you know I'll</font>

87
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-canned stuff that's brought into it</font>

88
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,819
but the point is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of</font>

89
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,420
electronic control units in cars so you

90
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:36,339
know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every wheel for the brakes</font>

91
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,819
plus also the tire pressure monitor

92
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,890
sensor there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ECU's for the fuel</font>

93
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,750
injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cars they're easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used for</font>

94
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,730
just about everything right so there's

95
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,500
almost a hundred electronic control

96
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,760
units in most cars right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

97
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,049
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different tier one</font>

98
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,780
manufacturers who write their own

99
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:55,540
firmware then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head unit</font>

100
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,910
which is basically not the dashboard but

101
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,260
the thing in the center so for those of

102
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,940
you who aren't familiar with all the

103
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,200
terms and the in the connected car

104
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,910
industry and go through a few of those

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,350
I'll explain them as i go into so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

106
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about head units usually the</font>

107
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,910
screen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see where you plug in</font>

108
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,138
your ipod and stuff like that it will

109
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,989
talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we</font>

110
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,730
go through so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have all this</font>

111
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,769
crap in cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first place and the</font>

112
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason is that the automotive</font>

113
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,300
manufacturers are trying to accommodate

114
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,000
consumers for all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interesting</font>

115
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,280
use cases things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,139
keep your kids entertained on their

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,530
iPads while

118
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">extreme them videos to write things like</font>

119
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,590
actually also behavior and policy

120
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,509
monitoring going back to kids for a

121
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,330
second if you have teenage kids being

122
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,009
able to monitor where they drive so if

123
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,498
they drive outside of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 mile radius</font>

124
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,599
of your home it'll actually the car can

125
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:48,870
alert you as a parent or if they're

126
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,248
speeding etc etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then obviously they</font>

127
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,270
want things like advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> diagnostics</font>

128
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,680
they want to be able to take all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

129
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,650
telemetry from your car and send it back

130
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this to the service center so that if</font>

131
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,888
your ECU for your brakes keep sending

132
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:00,240
all kinds of error messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

133
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,430
predictive maintenance right they say

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,990
hey your brakes are going to fail within

135
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,610
a certain amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it in fact</font>

136
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">what's going to end up happening or at</font>

137
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,000
least this is their vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the</font>

138
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,139
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> center will then schedule an</font>

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,750
appointment for you because if you think

140
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it you got your cell phone that</font>

141
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,569
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your car and that's what</font>

142
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">they want to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right you get into</font>

143
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,339
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> car everything on your cell phone</font>

144
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,620
transfers into the head unit including

145
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,599
your contacts your schedule etc etc your

146
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,360
phone goes dormant the car takes over

147
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,620
right so now the service center can now

148
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
schedule because they have access to

149
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">your calendar that say hey we think your</font>

150
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,610
brakes are going to fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've scheduled</font>

151
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the appointment for Saturday nine</font>

152
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,569
o'clock anybody wants you your

153
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,919
automotive service center to

154
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:41,370
automatically put things into your

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">calendar that's come on people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

156
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,029
the allure of the IOT that's going to

157
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,819
take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> our entire lives it's going to</font>

158
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:49,500
be awesome so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a little bit</font>

159
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,120
of background yeah there are two seminal

160
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,860
papers that were written by university

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,469
of washington in collaboration with the

162
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">University of California at San Diego</font>

163
00:05:54,469 --> 00:06:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what they did is in 2010 they did</font>

164
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,279
this study on cars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said what</font>

165
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,698
happens if you break into a car how far

166
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,740
can you penetrate and it turns out as

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,899
long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have access to the OED port</font>

168
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,689
on a car you can pretty much take over

169
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,159
the entire car it's it's hard and

170
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,270
crunchy on the outside soft and chewy on

171
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:17,188
the center as we used to say in the

172
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,409
firewall days right so they could do

173
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,659
things like once they jacked into the

174
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,879
car they could actually apply the brakes

175
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,460
even when the car was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going at 40 miles</font>

176
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,169
an hour on jack stands which should they

177
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,609
could disable the brakes or apply just

178
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,960
the left brake and not the right brake

179
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,550
they could pretty much control

180
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,979
everything in fact they wrote a piece of

181
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,659
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> called car shark where you</font>

182
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,639
could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> toy with all the</font>

183
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,510
electronic control modules in the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,630
car itself

185
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,539
so interestingly the automotive entry

186
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:49,740
kind of said ah not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that impressive and</font>

187
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,260
in fact if you look at if you saw back

188
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,880
in two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago valasek and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miller</font>

189
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,520
showed up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Today Show and they</font>

190
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,440
pretty much hacked into a Prius Anna

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,060
Explorer and they showed the general

192
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,800
public right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the public general</font>

193
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,440
public man oh boy you can break into

194
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,670
this however the car manufacturers said

195
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,230
we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Valassis</font>

196
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,000
was sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back seat there was a</font>

197
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,530
big data cable sneaking up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the front</font>

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,060
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car oh and by the way the</font>

199
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,380
dashboard was completely dismantled it's

200
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,120
gonna be pretty obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get in</font>

201
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,710
the car that somebody is jacked in right

202
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,520
so they were like we're not so worried

203
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have physical</font>

204
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">access so what ended up happening after</font>

205
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,740
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in 2011 so I went a little</font>

206
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,170
bit fast forward right so there's the

207
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,000
seminal paper in 2010 the autumn

208
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,140
manufacturers were like yeah you know

209
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of interesting without that</font>

210
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,530
interesting go about three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,300
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vlasic and Miller actually proved</font>

212
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,219
that they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the work of 2010</font>

213
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,170
and they showed how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked but go</font>

214
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,810
back for a second to 2010 and the

215
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,790
researcher said well you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font>

216
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,650
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside too so they did another</font>

217
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,260
study in 2011 they published the paper

218
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,239
and they said yeah the threat surface on

219
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,849
a vehicle is actually pretty damn broad

220
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,340
things like on Star<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you connect</font>

221
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,510
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth you get the cell</font>

222
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,010
network that connects into your

223
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,300
telematics unit which is part of the

224
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:09,090
head unit you've got things like short

225
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,470
short range RF which is basically for

226
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,090
vehicle to vehicle and infrastructure to

227
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,950
vehicle communications so think about

228
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,479
the use case<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> driving</font>

229
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,800
along and you go look at your text I

230
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,890
know you're not supposed to but you do

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,240
come on let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> face it and as soon as you</font>

232
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,919
do that the car in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you slams on</font>

233
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,690
its brakes now it sends a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message to all</font>

234
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cars in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the surrounding area that it</font>

235
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,660
just slammed on brakes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then your car</font>

236
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,680
waits a certain amount of time and if

237
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,540
you don't press your brakes it

238
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,800
automatically applies brakes that all

239
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,930
happens through vehicle-to-vehicle

240
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,669
communications same thing for

241
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure to vehicle communications</font>

242
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,159
if you're coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a really fast</font>

243
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,299
turn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when you're supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

244
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,250
going 40 miles an hour but you're

245
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,839
approaching at 60 the infrastructure can

246
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,340
tell your vehicle to slow you down to 40

247
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,840
miles an hour so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font>

248
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,630
things that are being instrumented into

249
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,010
vehicles now in case you didn't know so

250
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,670
these researchers when they did all this

251
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,520
they

252
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,280
actually they went the full they went

253
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the kickoff to the to the touchdown</font>

254
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,740
right they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> said we're going to</font>

255
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,420
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to break into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

256
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,400
telematics unit right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

257
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,699
that's the Holy Grail I can sit in my

258
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,459
living room in pick some evil country

259
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,130
Stan right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break into a</font>

260
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,420
car in the United States that is the

261
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Holy Grail so they actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proved you</font>

262
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,120
can do that as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have cell</font>

263
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,310
service you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the telematics</font>

264
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,350
unit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the car and when you do that</font>

265
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,699
they proved in 2010 that once you get

266
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to the telematics unit you have</font>

267
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">access the entire car the game over</font>

268
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,680
right in fact they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of</font>

269
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,590
other interesting things they actually

270
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">created a and by the way the telematics</font>

271
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,740
they found you didn't have to have

272
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,079
interactive access they could actually

273
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,720
they just recorded the cell signals the

274
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:43,710
audio of the cell signals they played it

275
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,300
over a over a mobile channel and it

276
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,560
automatically compromised the car so you

277
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,349
could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without actually having</font>

278
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,140
interactive access to they also did

279
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,710
things like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that there was a</font>

280
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:00,060
buffer overflow in the CD playing the

281
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:03,810
mp3 player in the CD CD unit and so they

282
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,969
they burned a some mp3s<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CD they</font>

283
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,130
put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car it played normally</font>

284
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,720
you know so Lady Gaga or whatever does

285
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,810
he listen to nowadays all you young kids

286
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it would it automatically buffer</font>

287
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,069
overflowed gained access to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

288
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,510
canvas which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you here in a</font>

289
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,670
second and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise</font>

290
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and it could it gave them</font>

291
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,030
remote access in fact they actually

292
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,300
pause it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they wrote the code</font>

293
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,850
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this where they could actually</font>

294
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,849
compromise the car have it call back on

295
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,110
an IRC<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and so they</font>

296
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,880
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> control like a bot so they</font>

297
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,600
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> could create a whole botnet</font>

298
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,660
army of cards just by giving you giving

299
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,820
you a CD they also compromised so you

300
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,890
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the vehicle maintenance you</font>

301
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,570
go in and you you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car to the</font>

302
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,189
service center and a service center guys

303
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,810
they have these laptops right and there

304
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,880
are some there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few depending on</font>

305
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,459
which manufacturers you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

306
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,070
with and they plug it into your car<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

307
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,899
they diagnose it and cetera et cetera so

308
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">they actually figured out which</font>

309
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,600
which laptops were customized to be

310
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,430
service center computers they

311
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,319
compromised it so that when you brought

312
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,599
your car in they plugged it into your

313
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,889
car it automatically loaded malware onto

314
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,689
your car through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service centers</font>

315
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,540
diagnostic computers that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

316
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:21,118
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool hack they also wrote</font>

317
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,189
a mobile mobile piece of mobile malware

318
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:25,110
that when you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your car when</font>

319
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your car it also took</font>

320
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,550
advantage of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth vulnerability</font>

321
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,899
so that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the malware and you</font>

322
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,449
have that particular car that had a

323
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,949
Bluetooth vulnerability they could then

324
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:38,279
access your car through your mobile

325
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:40,498
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone again sort of transit backs us so</font>

326
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,819
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> went they went pretty far improving</font>

327
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,889
that you could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise a car</font>

328
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,719
so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those of you who don't</font>

329
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:47,939
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how a car works on the</font>

330
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,369
inside there's usually and this is a

331
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:52,800
simplified version I've seen cars that

332
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:55,439
have 11 separate can buses or networks

333
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,559
in them there's usually three different

334
00:11:55,439 --> 00:12:01,079
buses for you and the most important one

335
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the control area network which is we</font>

336
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually call it something like can see</font>

337
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,559
can hyphen c you know for controller

338
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,969
area network<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for control I don't</font>

339
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,429
know what the C stands for who knows

340
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,449
anyway who cares different manufacturers

341
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,980
call it different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things but basically</font>

342
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,199
when we talk about canvas<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're thinking</font>

343
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the one that controls engine</font>

344
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,229
brakes air backs things that are

345
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,809
critical that's what the C stands for

346
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,120
but it can critical stance it's for

347
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:26,899
critical control systems on in the car

348
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,360
it's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> high speed go bus you and</font>

349
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,980
it is isolated<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the other to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,019
next one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local interconnect</font>

351
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,720
network nobody calls it that that's sort

352
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,699
of academic but what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's for</font>

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,170
things like your door locks your power

354
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows your lights things that are not</font>

355
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,559
critical controls but they are chassis

356
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,019
control so usually people call it the

357
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:48,329
chassis network and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one is</font>

358
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,160
your media and entertainment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

359
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:52,349
way the local interconnect is usually

360
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,579
low speed because who cares right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

361
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,499
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be that fast it's not</font>

362
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,599
critical controls and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

363
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually something that's for media</font>

364
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,110
things like your CD you know streaming

365
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,970
stuff to the television in the back so

366
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,809
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids don't go nuts one of the</font>

367
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I find really interesting</font>

368
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:08,100
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that even though they put</font>

369
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,630
these electronic control unit c zc use

370
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,580
between

371
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 sort of mediate the traffic think</font>

372
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,640
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as sort of firmware firewalls</font>

373
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,470
actually and those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones the</font>

374
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,560
research is compromised in the first

375
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,570
study they they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually act as</font>

376
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,510
firewalls because as we as we've shown

377
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,610
there as the researchers showed you can

378
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,630
basically compromise those and usually

379
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,730
what they end up doing by the way is

380
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,260
they'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into one of the other lower</font>

381
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,940
speed networks or the less critical

382
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,620
networks and then they'll figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

383
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,450
way to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> the firmware on this thing</font>

384
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,430
and then it turns it basically into a

385
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,440
router rather than a firewall if you

386
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,420
will but the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's</font>

387
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is that most of the use</font>

388
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,040
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> for connected cars actually</font>

389
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,410
require that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to multiple</font>

390
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,599
buses at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

391
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,890
keyless entry right there's a few things

392
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do you can open up the locks on</font>

393
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,689
your car obviously but you can also turn

394
00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,290
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your engine now right so that bridges</font>

395
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">two different buses on star has access</font>

396
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,319
to everything right so on star if you

397
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,990
get in an accident it automatically

398
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,150
notifies OnStar OnStar can unlock your

399
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:14,960
car they can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

400
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,870
engine if if your car stolen so those

401
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,640
kind of services all bridge all of these

402
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,430
buses and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've access to the</font>

403
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">on-board diagnostics report game over</font>

404
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,670
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have access to everything</font>

405
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,510
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so you know this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what</font>

406
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,150
it looks like on the inside and that's

407
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">what looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an outside so</font>

408
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,750
interestingly how hard is it to play

409
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,069
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this stuff I found out one</font>

410
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,860
of the reasons I got interested is back

411
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:43,220
in two thousand seven I have an old car

412
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:46,760
have a two thousand one car and it the

413
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,720
CD the GPS CD player because it had to

414
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,120
put a CD into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's before yeah</font>

415
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,830
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea people here the gps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

416
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,290
old GPS right it wasn't even DVD at the

417
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,640
time it broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to replace</font>

418
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,199
whole things I want on ebay<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I bought</font>

419
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,449
one I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to put in my car I</font>

420
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,220
stuck in the car and it wouldn't turn

421
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,390
off so kept killing my battery so I was

422
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,860
like hmmm i'm an engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should be</font>

423
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to figure us out so i go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

424
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:14,060
internet and I found schematics for

425
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,120
building a controller area network to

426
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,430
serial port interface so it only

427
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
required about 10 different discrete

428
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,779
components on a breadboard and I've done

429
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font>

430
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">ordering so I got it together and I</font>

431
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,300
soldered that thing up it was ugly as

432
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:30,240
hell by the way this is it in case any

433
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,910
of you who are soldering any makers it

434
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,360
looks like hell but I did it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

435
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,860
found on the Internet software that

436
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,839
actually once you plugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it by the</font>

437
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,389
way so it gave me a serial port

438
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,769
interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a laptop but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you had</font>

439
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have bare wires and cram them into</font>

440
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:48,480
your wiring harness it was really ugly

441
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:50,490
right and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that good at maker so</font>

442
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,420
I didn't bother putting a little pigtail

443
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,740
on there anything like this I just

444
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">crammed it down in there and it worked</font>

445
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,100
and I get the software out the internet

446
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,709
and I could watch the messages go back

447
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,059
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth on my car's network so I would</font>

448
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,329
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the key and it would say key and</font>

449
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,230
lock position<font color="#E5E5E5"> 01 to tell me when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

450
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the lights and you can actually</font>

451
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,230
reprogram it so that if you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

452
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,230
lights you put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high beams and</font>

453
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:11,519
actually just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your lights off you</font>

454
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,379
know you can just reprogram the whole

455
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,579
thing through it took me two hours I

456
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,709
didn't know about cars before I

457
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:20,670
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> this nothing the internet is</font>

458
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:22,949
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowadays right that was 2007</font>

459
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:27,420
you can go online<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can get an</font>

460
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:29,160
obd2 wireless a connector so you can buy

461
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for about 40 bucks on eBay or</font>

462
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,920
sparkfun or wherever you want to

463
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,170
wherever you're buying your electronic

464
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,329
stuff put it into your obd2 port on your

465
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,329
car go sit in your living room with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

466
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">laptop and hack the hell out of your car</font>

467
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:43,829
so it's out there and one of the things

468
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,420
that people say is that yeah but you

469
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know all the protocol decodes obd2</font>

470
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,449
is not necessarily you know it's not a

471
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,980
well published standard right because it

472
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:54,779
is a little bit obscure but you can go

473
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,370
get the protocol decodes online there

474
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a lot of them manufacturers do</font>

475
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,129
different things on the canned buses

476
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,660
with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vcu's and things</font>

477
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,629
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the general protocol</font>

478
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,898
decodes are available it's pretty easy

479
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:10,579
plus if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to play around</font>

480
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:13,829
the elastic and miller also created a

481
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,168
building your own car lab handbook where

482
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,139
you can actually take a chassis of a of

483
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,579
a go-kart and you can cram real

484
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,689
components right so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

485
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,039
chrysler you can go by<font color="#E5E5E5"> chrysler</font>

486
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,360
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crammed into this go-kart</font>

487
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,709
now you can hack around with it so

488
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,688
basically you can build your own car

489
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,990
hacking lab and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course online</font>

490
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,330
there's the car hackers a handbook<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

491
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,800
Connors manual so all this stuff is

492
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,600
actually pretty damn easy

493
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,550
now I tell you this because here's the

494
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,840
problems that the car manufacturers have

495
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,970
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for about a hundred and</font>

496
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,350
twenty years making cars they're used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

497
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:47,220
making them mechanically it's a pretty

498
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:50,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kabbalistic type of industry where they</font>

499
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">think what they do because it's so sort</font>

500
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,030
of obscure that nobody else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

501
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,300
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure it out but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font>

502
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,980
long gone right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is how I</font>

503
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,270
liken it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to switch gears for a</font>

504
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,370
second so I was working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ali a</font>

505
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,660
long time ago he got hacked i was

506
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,620
running my own company this guy got

507
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,170
hacked he's running the e-commerce

508
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,090
website they stole her certificate right

509
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,530
so we went in we did forensics we got

510
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,480
him back up and running and all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

511
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,310
I said what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your problems that you</font>

512
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">have here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server starts</font>

513
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:19,379
up you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a file that has the</font>

514
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,240
passphrase for your certificate all in

515
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,400
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> catted it you</font>

516
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,660
know when into the in the startup script

517
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,120
so that it would automatically unlock

518
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,680
the certificate so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you can't</font>

519
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,179
do that anymore when you start this

520
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing up you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to have</font>

521
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,180
it notifying you have to login

522
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,830
interactively there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a good</font>

523
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,530
way for you to have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically</font>

524
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,389
start up and unlock certificate and so

525
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,620
he had this other dev organization and

526
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,420
they were like wait a minute we've got

527
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,129
an idea we can solve this problem I was

528
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,080
like all right tell me so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

529
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,320
we're gonna hide the passphrase in a

530
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,149
binary I never liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> first what the hell</font>

531
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,980
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talking about hey go we're gonna</font>

532
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,570
split up the pass phrase if we're going

533
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,570
to code it into an executable it's gonna

534
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,710
be awesome and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay that</font>

535
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,629
sounds like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of work now how does</font>

536
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,250
this work again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there you go oh yeah</font>

537
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,990
when the server starts up we're actually

538
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,800
going to run the thing and it'll spit

539
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,500
out the passphrase and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

540
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,060
stupid so it's instead of them instead

541
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,080
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hacker who actually gets into the</font>

542
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,760
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to go ducat passphrase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> txt</font>

543
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,710
now you save them six characters all you

544
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you know dot slash can pass</font>

545
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,580
phrase right so it was the most stupid

546
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,320
thing I've ever heard but this is the

547
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,879
way some people think and I'm not saying

548
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the automotive industry is thinking</font>

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,570
it but my point is this that people try

550
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,770
to they use obscurity as a method of

551
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:38,070
security and we know that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain</font>

552
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,660
 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so let's talk</font>

553
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,710
about valla second Miller for a second

554
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,470
how did they break into the car so the

555
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,310
they did a few things number one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

556
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,140
they found<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

557
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,149
break into the

558
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,000
in cabin Wi-Fi right so a lot of cars

559
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,560
now have Wi-Fi for the vehicle in the

560
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Christ in the Jeep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had right</font>

561
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,230
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrysler product which is the</font>

562
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,400
one by Fiat so anyway you get the point

563
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:06,110
that they there you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to subscribe to</font>

564
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,150
you connect which is their version of

565
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,340
onstar in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

566
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,870
Wi-Fi but if you do what ends up

567
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,120
happening is that there is a default

568
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,699
password it is wpa which is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

569
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,080
requires eight characters alphanumeric

570
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,870
characters if you do change the past

571
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,720
passphrase but the password by default

572
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,020
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random character anybody see where</font>

573
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is going already right so there's a</font>

574
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">few things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first off it</font>

575
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually and i think i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font>

576
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
have the code for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

577
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,179
ends up happening is that the head unit

578
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,100
boots up and it has the Wi-Fi module the

579
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,050
Wi-Fi module queries the clock is part

580
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:46,790
of its part of its the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that it</font>

581
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,740
actually gets the it randomizes right so

582
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:50,690
calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> r and with with time right</font>

583
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,650
everybody knows I'm documented so

584
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,210
effectively what ends up happening

585
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,400
though there's a race condition where

586
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,740
the clock ship hasn't quite yet set the

587
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,830
time by at the time the Wi-Fi module

588
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,050
boots up so the time has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not been set so</font>

589
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,800
it actually gets a default of january

590
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:08,389
first 2013 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty predictable about</font>

591
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,730
valasek and<font color="#E5E5E5"> miller found that it the</font>

592
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:14,420
boot up time is about 30 to 32 seconds

593
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,400
after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi module gets his password</font>

594
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,840
about 30 to 32 seconds after the car

595
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,540
boot supper after the head unit boots up

596
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,570
so you actually reduce the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

597
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,430
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for randomization to about you know</font>

598
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">within about five seconds of a</font>

599
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:29,780
particular time so you knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rand</font>

600
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,160
time actually gave you certain values it

601
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,920
was pretty easy predict at that point

602
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,960
what the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> password set was right</font>

603
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,400
so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> without that using time as a way</font>

604
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,170
to randomize is the only way to

605
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,240
randomize is not particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> bright we</font>

606
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,400
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> already anybody here not that</font>

607
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,780
know that already that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

608
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a dev conferences when you</font>

609
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,910
actually talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people about security</font>

610
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,530
you guys get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what they also once</font>

611
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,680
they but then they were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's</font>

612
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,570
kind of a pain we don't really we don't

613
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,130
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use Wi-Fi in that</font>

614
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,230
particular well actually I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

615
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting ahead of myself so they connect</font>

616
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,540
it up to the Wi-Fi

617
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,100
and then they started scanning and they

618
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,870
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of interesting ports on</font>

619
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">there right so a lot of them who the</font>

620
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,419
hell knows what they are you know this

621
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a pretty obscure stuff it's a head</font>

622
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,010
unit made by harman kardon but they did

623
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,350
find something really interesting which

624
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,690
is port 6667 is open no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

625
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">are that's interesting why is IRC</font>

626
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,530
running on a car right so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

627
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,230
things happen either the car has been

628
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,760
packed already before they've got to it

629
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,260
or somebody I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why the hell</font>

630
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,550
they choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6667 but it's kind of</font>

631
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,590
interesting so they started poking

632
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:36,990
around at it and what they find is that

633
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:38,610
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx you</font>

634
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,270
guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx is rights BlackBerry's</font>

635
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:45,030
linux alike variant that runs on a lot

636
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,730
of IOT devices so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and what</font>

637
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,500
they find is that all you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

638
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,180
type<font color="#E5E5E5"> in off anonymous and you have</font>

639
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,100
anonymous access so effectively there is

640
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,950
no password<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the same so as long as</font>

641
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have access to the in-car Wi-Fi you</font>

642
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">can tell that to 66 67 login with</font>

643
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,690
anonymous and you have access to root on

644
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QNX system that runs a head unit</font>

645
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense let that sink in for a</font>

646
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,030
second that's pretty damning right so

647
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,170
next thing they did is they said all

648
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:18,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">right how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this to actually so</font>

649
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:20,370
in the way it works is that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

650
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,930
the head unit excuse me you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx</font>

651
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,600
which runs a lot of the telematics types

652
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,610
of stuff but then you've got the can bus

653
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,510
unit which is supposed to be separate

654
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,709
from and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font>

655
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get from the head unit to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the canvas</font>

656
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,890
it's how it works out so they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

657
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,650
figure out a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

658
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,870
get from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx instance on the on the</font>

659
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:41,520
head unit over to the canvas they wanted

660
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:43,979
to be able to to send to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> canbus</font>

661
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,930
messages from there so what they want to

662
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,110
do is they they're figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what's</font>

663
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:54,150
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we actually do something from</font>

664
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:56,760
that head unit to gain access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

665
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:59,100
the what's effectively the thief it's a

666
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,300
v8 50 chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the thing how do I</font>

667
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,679
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I should have a picture of</font>

668
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to be quite frank with you so you</font>

669
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,300
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx here and it's separated but it's</font>

670
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,400
also connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VA 50 chip that the</font>

671
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,169
850 chip is actually what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls</font>

672
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,030
the can bus so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to figure out</font>

673
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,380
how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could get that so effectively</font>

674
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:17,710
what they did is

675
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,450
they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to they wanted to they</font>

676
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,520
wanted two things to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

677
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">but also not to have to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to</font>

678
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,160
the Wi-Fi right because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

679
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,210
able to do that from anywhere in the

680
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,340
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to hack into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

681
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from anywhere in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world so they</font>

682
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,399
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things one of the</font>

683
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,760
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to find out is how</font>

684
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,180
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can they set some sort</font>

685
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,910
of can they route this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> can they</font>

686
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,710
install their own software on it

687
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,610
ineffective that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they found is that</font>

688
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,340
there's a few things that they could do

689
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:49,449
you can actually update the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISO image on</font>

690
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:52,570
a particular on the VA 50 chip because

691
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it allows you to update it but the</font>

692
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,030
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the that the head unit</font>

693
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,290
when it goes into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update mode and so</font>

694
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:01,510
does the VA 50 chip so they didn't

695
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,550
actually have access to both at the same

696
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because when the head unit goes</font>

697
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,720
into update mode it knocks you off line

698
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,940
so they didn't have access to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

699
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,820
update the 850 firmware to give them

700
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,710
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the can bus through the USB 3</font>

701
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,730
the head unit so they had to do a few

702
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:20,170
things right they had to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how</font>

703
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,820
to overcome the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that that the head</font>

704
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,800
unit was offline when they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

705
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">update the firmware so what they figured</font>

706
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,990
they could do is if they could actually

707
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:31,030
write data to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file system on the</font>

708
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,770
head unit then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually</font>

709
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,970
execute commands when it reboots and

710
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,990
that could actually do the flash so in

711
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,430
other words they don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

712
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,520
interactive shell to the head unit in

713
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,560
order to to flash the firmware so a few

714
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">things they did figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to do</font>

715
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that through 11 ways that the system</font>

716
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,680
boot actually allows you to call

717
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,210
arbitrary scripts they did have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

718
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the fact that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a read-only</font>

719
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,290
file system at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they didn't</font>

720
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,310
figure that out the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

721
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,440
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was kind of</font>

722
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,419
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there were a lot of</font>

723
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,130
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> injection flaws as well so you</font>

724
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:03,070
could actually do just about anything

725
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,640
right so anybody recognize a string

726
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,230
concatenation as a way to throw to

727
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,850
inject commands here so as long as

728
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody had access to the operating</font>

729
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,550
system you could actually control this

730
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,230
trail pass saved variable and execute

731
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,550
whatever it is that you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

732
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,690
the execution of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular script</font>

733
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,340
so they had a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways that they could</font>

734
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">get around the fact that they didn't</font>

735
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,350
have interactive access to it so and by

736
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,170
the way interestingly there are some fun

737
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,760
tools

738
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,770
cat that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

739
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting development and hacking</font>

740
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:36,530
tools on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QNX system by default so</font>

741
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,180
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a best practice right so again</font>

742
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where sort of i call this sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

743
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,360
a DevOps problem because part of it is

744
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,919
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is a horrible</font>

745
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a horrible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do we all</font>

746
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,790
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but also this is a bad thing</font>

747
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do never leave your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> development tools</font>

748
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,730
and things like that cat on the system

749
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:54,800
in production so they so now they're

750
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,540
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we through the Wi-Fi network</font>

751
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,909
we know how to hack into<font color="#CCCCCC"> qnx we know how</font>

752
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,159
to gain access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file system we</font>

753
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,390
know how to put we knew how to put files

754
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,890
on and so that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the systems</font>

755
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,320
rebooting that we can actually do things

756
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,140
like update that the a50 firmware but

757
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,360
how can we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this remotely so what they</font>

758
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,090
found was that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though the head unit</font>

759
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,189
was listening on 66 67 it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

760
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,990
listening on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire internet so you</font>

761
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't be on some random provider and</font>

762
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,000
gain access to it but as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

763
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,460
were on the providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and sprint</font>

764
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,500
actually made the spring was the

765
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,930
provider that is used by Fiat and

766
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,910
Chrysler so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you run sprints</font>

767
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,460
network you could actually gain access

768
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,110
to port 6667 so at first what they did

769
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,490
is they took a femtocell and so they

770
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,870
could sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know their living room</font>

771
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,610
and actually connected a car the car

772
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,719
conducted<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it gave them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

773
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,169
more range but it didn't give him the

774
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire range so but then they found they</font>

775
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,040
went out and they fired up internet

776
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,080
sharing they got a burner phone from

777
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sprint they fired up internet sharing on</font>

778
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,050
it and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that they could gain</font>

779
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,760
access to it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sprint network in</font>

780
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:58,100
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> they scanned all of sprint's</font>

781
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,760
network on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was two Class B</font>

782
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,070
ranges 2400 2500 or something like that

783
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,460
I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember exactly and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

784
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,679
somewhere on the order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about want to</font>

785
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:12,350
say 200,000 cars that were vulnerable

786
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,270
we're listening on port 6667 it turns

787
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,800
out in the end there were 1.4 million

788
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,030
cars that were actually vulnerable right

789
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,830
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what Chrysler actually</font>

790
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,540
ended up recalling but it turns out that

791
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,399
they could actually from their living

792
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,320
room on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sprint burner phone with</font>

793
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,230
internet sharing from a computer gain

794
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,270
access to 1.4 million cars and basically

795
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,860
hack them that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential threat</font>

796
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:35,000
that they uncovered at that point so

797
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing that we've done so far those</font>

798
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,789
exploit the head unit right so we can do

799
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,580
things on the head unit like you can

800
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:44,350
turn the radio volume up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disco and</font>

801
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,759
actually disable the volume right the

802
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,070
the control so if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting in my</font>

803
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,129
there could be 1.4 million people

804
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,450
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their jeeps and other</font>

805
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:54,309
chrysler vehicles but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden</font>

806
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,509
the volume goes to disco and then they

807
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,399
keep playing around trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn it</font>

808
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:58,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">down and it will not turn down right so</font>

809
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:00,459
it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mischief but there's</font>

810
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,049
nothing really particularly problematic

811
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,850
about that they could turn the

812
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,379
temperature up and down they could read

813
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,969
the GPS telemetry now we're getting

814
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">until they were privacy right so you</font>

815
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,289
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something more interesting they</font>

816
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:12,580
could put a custom splash screen so

817
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:14,379
presumably you could put porn on

818
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,090
everybody's Chrysler if you wanted to on

819
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:18,519
the head unit or something equally is

820
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:22,269
interesting but they couldn't do

821
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,679
anything further so like I said before

822
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:26,649
they actually figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to update</font>

823
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:31,359
the VAD<font color="#E5E5E5"> v8 50 can controller firmware</font>

824
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:33,758
chip and interestingly it did not

825
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,799
require any cryptographic signature so

826
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,899
you could put anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to on</font>

827
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,739
that chip right you did not have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

828
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:43,330
around any sort of hash value at all so

829
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,460
they figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

830
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,769
there were some limitations on how the

831
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,809
head unit actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> connects to the 50</font>

832
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:51,789
chip but they also found that it

833
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,168
listened through<font color="#E5E5E5"> serial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> port interface</font>

834
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,489
right so it had two ways they can

835
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:56,499
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to it so they could send</font>

836
00:29:54,489 --> 00:30:01,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands from the head unit directly to</font>

837
00:29:56,499 --> 00:30:03,159
the to the p 850 through through serial

838
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:04,840
interface and it has sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an API that</font>

839
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,729
they could actually use so what they

840
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,459
ended up doing is and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

841
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:10,840
lot of a lot of technical detail which

842
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,239
is way beyond what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

843
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now is but basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they did</font>

844
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:16,809
is they found a different they found

845
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,159
places in the code and I use I to pro

846
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:20,979
right for anybody here at the flash

847
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,879
talks yesterday with a car flash dude we

848
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:24,009
call flash docks what the hell do we

849
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:25,779
call those things speed talk thank you

850
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,090
yeah you guys weren't there what the

851
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:30,340
hell's wrong with you come on so one of

852
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,139
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the panel there at</font>

853
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,699
the last minute addition and one of the

854
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:36,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody was saying is you</font>

855
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,929
know if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got access to if you want</font>

856
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,609
to be able to test precompile code you

857
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:39,879
know something off the shelf then you

858
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:42,879
know

859
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:44,978
it's a there is some measure of security

860
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:46,448
in that and all I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is</font>

861
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:48,519
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here ever heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> light of pro</font>

862
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:50,319
right so you can gain access to it about

863
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything so that's what these guys did</font>

864
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,309
they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ida pro they d compiled at the</font>

865
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,689
a50 chip which by the way all you need

866
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,709
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is suck the firmware off the chip</font>

867
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,089
in the first place you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to</font>

868
00:30:56,709 --> 00:31:00,129
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's stored which is</font>

869
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,259
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard they did that there was</font>

870
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:04,689
actually a decode<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Ida pro for the VA</font>

871
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,799
50 chip score right didn't have to write

872
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:09,699
too much they'd have to write a little

873
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of decode but for the most part they</font>

874
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:14,049
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was already ready for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and then</font>

875
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:16,719
they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where the commands are</font>

876
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:18,668
actually sent set and then they sent

877
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,799
them over the serial interface and bang

878
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:23,979
all of a sudden they had access from the

879
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:29,889
head unit to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to send data to the</font>

880
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:31,779
can bus so so there we go now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

881
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,508
the other technical challenge they had

882
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:38,199
to overcome is that the easy use if

883
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:41,139
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to reflash an ECU you need</font>

884
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:44,229
to know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> its they actually have some</font>

885
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:46,658
sort of shared secret between the two it

886
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:48,519
turns out that on all almost all the

887
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:50,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">ecu's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> except for one it was basically</font>

888
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">just obfuscation it was a shared secret</font>

889
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,559
they were stored in a binary on the VA

890
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:58,508
50 chip I believe right there in the

891
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,229
file<font color="#CCCCCC"> system that once you sucked it off</font>

892
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:01,779
and you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the obfuscation</font>

893
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:03,999
is you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaintext ring it was</font>

894
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:05,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually pretty easy so again you know</font>

895
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:07,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">using things that are not real</font>

896
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:10,299
cryptographic functions cause cause

897
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:11,978
problems so and then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds</font>

898
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:13,359
of other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and basically</font>

899
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:14,919
what they wanted to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do and</font>

900
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,418
think about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy use work right you</font>

901
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,389
send some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> message from the</font>

902
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:20,919
initiator to a destination ECU<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

903
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:23,619
do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of things you listen to the</font>

904
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,779
can bus messages you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> force drops on</font>

905
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:28,149
different messages you can spoof<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

906
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:30,639
initiator and send a false message to

907
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:33,309
the ECU Rican flood the bus and they had

908
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:35,799
to use many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these different tactics</font>

909
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:36,940
for for different reasons first off

910
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,319
listening because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they needed to be able</font>

911
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure out what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hell that message</font>

912
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,959
were so they could actually send them in

913
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:47,079
some cases so for example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get</font>

914
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:49,180
this right there was one message I think

915
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:51,970
it was taking control of the

916
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably wrong in this one because</font>

917
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,380
it's doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound right in my head but</font>

918
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:58,120
anyway that there's in many vehicles now

919
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,950
they have lain correction control which

920
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,169
effectively is there's a curator

921
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">actuators in your steering wheel and so</font>

922
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,160
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have disturbing taken</font>

923
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,350
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the driver you know</font>

924
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,450
so the whole point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera</font>

925
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,189
looks and it sees that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're over</font>

926
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the line for any length of time it'll</font>

927
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,630
actually correct your your steering to

928
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:18,340
get you back into your lane so you can

929
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,870
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that on the car</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can grab</font>

930
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,760
the steering wheel out of drivers hands

931
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,250
and send them off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tall bridge if you</font>

932
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,450
want to do so what they did what they

933
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,160
found is that when they sent those

934
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,710
messages to the steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheel saying</font>

935
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,930
you know go right or left the other the

936
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,330
lane correction control<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're saying no</font>

937
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,340
no we're not seeing any any problem so

938
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,980
don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but what they found is</font>

939
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,139
that if you send more messages telling

940
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,610
it to turn the wheel hard right then

941
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,640
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ascending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying there is no</font>

942
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:48,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem then the volume of messages one</font>

943
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,960
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically they just flooded the</font>

944
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,580
network with yes go ahead and yank the

945
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,160
week disturbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> me all right and it over</font>

946
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,210
overcame the correction mechanism which

947
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:02,200
said there's no particular problem so

948
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,790
anyway anybody interesting fun yeah cool

949
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff anybody here ready to go hack</font>

950
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:08,469
their car<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already showed you ready get</font>

951
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,940
the stuff so knock yourself out so part

952
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:11,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem i just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point I I</font>

953
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,810
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it sounds like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bashing auto</font>

954
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,280
manufacturers I'm not think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

955
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,380
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing with</font>

956
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same designs for so many years it is</font>

957
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:23,110
it and it takes anywhere it takes from

958
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,160
three to seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think from the</font>

959
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,680
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inception to the point</font>

960
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,810
production for a new model car and

961
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,449
they're often based upon previous model

962
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,000
designs so Tesla on the other hand by

963
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way has leg up on these guys right</font>

964
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,050
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the ability to build cars</font>

965
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:40,120
from scratch without having to have the

966
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,790
previous design and they're basically

967
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,139
computers mobile phones on wheels but

968
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,040
they still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> not been immune to</font>

969
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:49,480
problems right so they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some</font>

970
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,909
issues you know we've seen for example

971
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,110
on the the web portal where you go

972
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,310
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you authenticate with your</font>

973
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">mobile phone to do all kinds of things</font>

974
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,299
like set the temperature and see how

975
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,230
much battery usage and all that there

976
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,590
was some authentication issue I can't

977
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,030
what it was but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was some HTTP normal</font>

978
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,510
what we would think of as a normal

979
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,990
vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> ditch there was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese</font>

980
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:13,340
contest at sis can 360 where they did

981
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like open up the moonroof and I</font>

982
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,480
locked the door so they still have

983
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,369
problems but it turns out because they

984
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,320
were built as computers to begin with

985
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,470
they have over-the-air updates so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

986
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">can fix these problems much quicker and</font>

987
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,980
so blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah there's all kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

988
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,630
problems we know that here's the thing

989
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">too I already talked about vehicle to</font>

990
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,840
vehicle and<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure the vehicle</font>

991
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,690
self-driving cars are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

992
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,710
the game so here's my scenario right

993
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:41,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like fear uncertainty and</font>

994
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:43,880
doubt so what do they call this a

995
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,589
setting scene or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that you</font>

996
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">know so think movies so you get this</font>

997
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,550
top-down view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Los Angeles and all of</font>

998
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,899
a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see all these cars backing</font>

999
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,700
out of their driveways at the same time

1000
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,350
and then they're all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a chop</font>

1001
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,500
shop right so hundreds of thousands of

1002
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,430
vehicles driving down 101 on Los Angeles

1003
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,900
and then the cops come and they're

1004
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,339
driving as I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to stop them and</font>

1005
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,900
some of the autonomous vehicles starts

1006
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,500
ramming into cops it'd be an awesome

1007
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,640
movie wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's so that's kind of</font>

1008
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a fear and certainty death that's never</font>

1009
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,170
gonna happen by the way most likely but

1010
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,490
maybe self-driving cars could be fun so

1011
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,260
we think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1012
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,930
stuff right<font color="#E5E5E5"> safety problems but it's</font>

1013
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,730
also obviously the privacy problems

1014
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,049
because all your<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile phone stuff's</font>

1015
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,070
going to be in the car somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks</font>

1016
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> car they get all your</font>

1017
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,580
information contacts email<font color="#CCCCCC"> yada yada</font>

1018
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">yada so there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff to worry</font>

1019
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:32,000
about so is the beginning at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the</font>

1020
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,859
answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what do we do to</font>

1021
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve this problem so I've talked about</font>

1022
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:37,340
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad things how you can break in</font>

1023
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,799
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we when we're</font>

1024
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,280
developing can not make these same

1025
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:46,430
mistakes so first off<font color="#E5E5E5"> security by</font>

1026
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,109
obscurity is ridiculous so never don't

1027
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">rely on security by obscurity and I</font>

1028
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:53,270
think I've already talked that to death

1029
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:54,799
right the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1030
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,600
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with IOT devices they're usually</font>

1031
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,359
an amalgam of a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff bought</font>

1032
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,950
from different tier 1 suppliers with

1033
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,259
different with code to glue it all

1034
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:05,299
together etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the things</font>

1035
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,570
don't let race conditions foil your

1036
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,460
security plans right so there are

1037
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,400
there's not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about randomization but</font>

1038
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,069
also password authentication

1039
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,869
we've seen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart meters a Leo</font>

1040
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,490
active did some research on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that where</font>

1041
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:20,380
it showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their race conditions</font>

1042
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,970
where by the time you start to

1043
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,710
authenticate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time something</font>

1044
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,480
actually occurs with some operation that

1045
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,619
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do that the race</font>

1046
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">condition can actually allow that</font>

1047
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,279
operation to occur without

1048
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:32,460
authentication completing right so there

1049
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:35,920
are cases where race conditions<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1050
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause problems get rid of the dev and</font>

1051
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,789
test tools from your production system

1052
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:41,380
strip symbols you know and all that yes

1053
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:43,450
I get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a</font>

make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as easy it don't make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy on</font>

1056
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:51,279
the hackers right so limit the exposed

1057
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,099
services and ports by not binding to to

1058
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:55,630
all interfaces for example and most

1059
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:58,000
important is require strong hashes for

1060
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,250
updates in fact BMW had a problem with

1061
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of their cars and they did an</font>

1062
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,400
over-the-air update which everybody

1063
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,510
lauded as being great success but I

1064
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,770
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any researchers have</font>

1065
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,809
actually gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> through to figure out what</font>

1066
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:11,049
their integrity checking system was

1067
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:14,109
right so could you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> hijack those</font>

1068
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:16,029
updates in transit and in compromise

1069
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:21,609
them I don't know anybody up for a

1070
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:23,829
project could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fun also here's the</font>

1071
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:27,009
problem with checksums like on the can

1072
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:28,450
bus itself the message diversity is not

1073
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,859
very broad right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very diverse</font>

1074
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,538
set of messages so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

1075
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:33,009
actually intercept all the messages and

1076
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:35,440
figure out what all the checksum should

1077
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,579
be between all of them so one of the

1078
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,650
things that's most important is don't

1079
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,119
rely purely on checksums but also use

1080
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,270
things like policy and behavior based

1081
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,039
detection so for example there are

1082
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,500
there's research being done now to see

1083
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:49,510
how different drivers operate like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1084
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,309
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not turn press my brakes I</font>

1085
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,839
learned how to drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a standard so I</font>

1086
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,880
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to gear down and I watch you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">'we had to be my wife on the other hand</font>

1088

1090
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,470
dozen times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going anywhere so</font>

1091
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can figure out how fast people are</font>

1092
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,730
driving or how they their<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior is</font>

1093
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,529
and then you can gauge based upon that

1094
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,270
particular behavior and you can figure

1095
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">out who I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am by the way in many ways my</font>

1096
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,079
global phones in the car they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1097
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,750
have weight sensors and seats now so

1098
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,970
they can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if it's you there</font>

1099
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:21,099
and then you're driving pattern itself

1100
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,750
can kind of gauge who you are as well so

1101
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:24,460
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am sitting in the past in the</font>

1102
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">driver seat and all of a sudden I'm</font>

1103
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,340
applying the brakes more often

1104
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,890
should or etc etc those kind of things

1105
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,330
then you should probably take some

1106
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">action to remediate that right because</font>

1107
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,500
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really me or maybe it's being</font>

1108
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,690
spooked or things that shouldn't ever

1109
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,490
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brake should never</font>

1110
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,780
go by itself without the right brake

1111
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,459
going on right so that's a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1112
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,350
put spinning out of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a bad</font>

1113
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,030
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ever have happen so those are</font>

1114
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:51,860
kind of policy based behaviors and then

1115
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:55,430
behavior but policy based decisions and

1116
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:59,740
then behavior based decisions as well uh

1117
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">also we all know this stuff right don't</font>

1118
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:05,629
always am always validate your input

1119
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:09,470
always have buffer sanity checks never

1120
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:12,800
use string copy without bounds never use

1121
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:16,730
concatenated strings to do things like

1122
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">call databases or or exec ve or anything</font>

1123
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,710
like that right so concatenated strings

1124
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,509
are horrible for that kind of stuff make

1125
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:28,340
sure that random is actually random

1126
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:31,220
don't just use normal random stuff who

1127
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,680
whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking before me about the</font>

1128
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,779
protocols had made that point as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,399
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> libraries ran does not really</font>

1130
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,200
ran so make sure you know what you're

1131
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,840
doing don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever use default credentials</font>

1132
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,430
or non-us authentication and here's the

1133
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,070
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that I see is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell out of systems you know people</font>

offered a paper called design-build

1159
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,930

academia and mostly academia in to

00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,990
basically break into cars they also

1168
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,210
involve the automaker's but it's

1169
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,348
basically taking educational facilities

1170
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,760
and they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to break into a</font>

hey here's where all the problems are so

it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great it's great fun and actually</font>

coincidentally i just had a rather long

what are they actually trying to

somebody knocking their minivan into a

ditch like we showed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first slide</font>

1191
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,329
here so tone down the fear uncertainty

00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,630
doubt actually no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but your adversaries</font>

1193
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:55,640
are code for threat cases and just use

1194
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,680
common sense and don't do stupid

1195
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,930
like to have default passwords and

1196
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,180
strength catenation and blah blah blah

1197

<font color="#E5E5E5">what can consumers do to protect</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves nothing the most ridiculous</font>

1202
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,030
thing I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever heard is that consumers</font>

1203
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,828
I actually have control over their fate

1204
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,250
when it comes to connected cars or IOT

1205
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,990
devices who uses this stuff my aunt is

1206
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,420
on facebook and she posts the most

1207
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,339
stupid things she is she<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't set her</font>

1208
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,810
privacy controls why am I going to

1209
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:29,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect that she's going to be able to</font>

1210
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:31,520
set her nest controls or her connected

1211
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:33,349
car security controls know is that we're

1212
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen plus a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of IOT</font>

1213
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:37,339
devices don't actually expose any sort

1214
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,200
of configuration settings to begin with

1215
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:41,509
or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough that we can deal</font>

1216
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,939
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them Plus as it hits the enterprise</font>

1217
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,770
market IT people don't know how to set

1218
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,839
that crap i remember back in the day

1219
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,050
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t some I tea shops are</font>

1220
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,850
responsible for pbx<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up</font>

1221
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,400
never said about properly that was an

1222
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:57,430
awesome way to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a system break</font>

1223
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,110
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PBX through the dialing modem do</font>

1224
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:00,910
some war dialing it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1225
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,320
default password within a certain area

1226
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,910
because it's the same installer who

1227
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,470
installs that thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to</font>

1228
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,480
make it as easy as possible then you

1229
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,310
have access to the PBX but that's not

1230
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,170
the land right so not really worried

1231
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,640
about it but wait executives always

1232
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,020
wanted to print out there call logs so

1233
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,069
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they do they're like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

1234
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a printer and stick it on</font>

1235
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:20,230
the PBX we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 perfectly good HP</font>

1236
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,990
printers on our land let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug our</font>

1237
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,580
pbx in our land and problem solved which

1238
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,140
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing they ever did for pen</font>

1239
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,140
testers right anybody ever hear of a pen

1240
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,509
test to pdx much fun you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1241
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,359
anything so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point is it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not up to</font>

1242
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it shouldn't be up to the end users</font>

1243
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,360
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect users from</font>

1244
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:44,520
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> in many cases so that's it</font>

1245
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:44,520
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me any questions any questions yes</font>

1246
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,900
because the entire we're not building

1247
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,529
cars let me start there but the entire

1248
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,270
ecosystem comprises cars that connect to

1249
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,660
networks that connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud that</font>

1250
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:06,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to mobile phones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we</font>

1251
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,140
connect we protect all of that stuff

1252
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,460
right so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an IT problems</font>

1253
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">would get solutions of that and we're</font>

1254
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,000
also doing a lot of research<font color="#CCCCCC"> into how to</font>

1255
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,370
and building some solutions for car so

1256
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,470
for example we actually have a group

1257
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,359
called the cyber cyber center of

1258
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:21,879
excellence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel works with ben</font>

1259
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,550
gurion university and beer sheva and

1260
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,240
they have come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution where</font>

1261
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:30,070
they put a device on the can bus and

1262
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,959
watch for messages and they look for

1263
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:33,820
things that are anomalous then they send

1264
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,200
events back to a cloud-based system

1265
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,140
which does analytics across not just

1266
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car but also all of cars so they</font>

1267
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,779
can detect things like vehicle the

1268
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,190
vehicle attacks and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1269
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,380
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you the truth when</font>

1270
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,280
I came to IBM I came from q1 labs as an

1271
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,010
acquisition I've only been there for

1272
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,150
three and a half years I said IBM this

00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be horrible</font>
