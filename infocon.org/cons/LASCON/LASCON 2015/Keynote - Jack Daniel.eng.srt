dramatically revised it for 4 last con

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,140
so how did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get here this is not</font>

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,790
actually the route I took I was in

Georgia came from Jacksonville and

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,100
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I mean anyway but</font>

how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get where we are now you know</font>

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,880
it's a question that philosophers

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,060
scientists and drunkards have asked

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,399

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,429
seemed like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good idea at the time but</font>

they're really valuable especially for

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,410
sitting around and thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,970
talking to people about vulnerability

management continuous monitoring and

74
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,100
actually though I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool job</font>

75
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,720
I get to do whatever I want I'm last

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,540
year I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a three-person team with</font>

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,490
Marcus random space rogue and myself

78
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,470
let's just let that sink in that means

79
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,860
face road was the young idealist on our

80
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,630
team space rogue is in a different team

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,370
now now it's just Marcus and I it's too

82
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,780
cranky old man and the terrifying thing

83
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,580
is that makes him<font color="#CCCCCC"> the young one and me</font>

84
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,910
the idealist so anyway that's basically

85
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,460
how I got here to last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,700
really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant either but out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

87
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:09,350
the industry get here and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font>

88
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">on you know I've got a confession I</font>

89
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,739
don't know this stuff I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to research</font>

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,600
it part of the reason we teach things or

91
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,190
give presentations on them is to force

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,529
ourselves to learn things we should have

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">known already right what every teaching</font>

94
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,080
is a fantastic way to learn stuff you

95
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:31,020
thought you knew and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn it</font>

96
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:34,229
so don't laugh we all are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of</font>

psychedelia that is all of heavy metal

159
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,810
that is punk'd because it was a pure

160
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,979
punk attitude and we have this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always easy to find the people</font>

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,120
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it some hacker cons there are a lot</font>

188
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,480
of really good people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and have</font>

been through the centuries in military

intelligence and if you have problems

191
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,250
like I do with some of the excesses of

00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:01,069
NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gchq it's not with the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

193

the trenches who built the industry that

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're in and they're still doing good</font>

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,610
stuff so but that's a barrier you know a

196
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of military stuff and a lot of</font>

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,589
segmented a lot of educational stuff

199
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,599
higher ed you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's Isetta</font>

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,220
silos so we don't always move on a lot

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,540
dwell on these but let's focus on the

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,839
fact that these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just think</font>

if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else did instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of having</font>

doesn't mean you can't take it further

333
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,879
just remember there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this five folks that i will</font>

336
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,980
but we can't not start with grace hopper

337
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,689
if you don't know grace hopper stories

338
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:44,179
they're phenomenal she was an amazing

339
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:46,759
woman the reasons bugcrowd has adopted

340
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:49,670
her is because the term debugging comes

341
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:53,990
from grace hopper mechanical switches

342
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,929
mechanical relay she took a moth out of

343
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:01,069
a relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to debug the operation of a</font>

344
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:03,439
system and thus we have debugging if you

345
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:07,128
want a really quick introduction to how

346
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:09,050
awesome she was go to youtube find the

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,689
interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with david letterman it's</font>

348
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,519
it's phenomenal her her stick was she

349
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:15,849
carried pieces of wire like would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

satellite communications took so why

00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:27,740
does it take this is how fast like a

mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was a project so</font>

709
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,520
this is dude he sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changed the way</font>

710

we look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world forever is Miss</font>

711
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,000
quoted as saying if I've seen further

712
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's by standing on the shoulders of</font>

713
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,020
giants that's a Newton he changed the

714
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,909
way we look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world forever that's</font>

715
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,910
actually a line that he repeated that

716
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,609
someone had that he had learned from

717

powerful guy changed literally changed

719
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,219
the label of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world flows and there</font>

720
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,750
are people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us beyond</font>

721
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">Newtonian physics right there people</font>

722
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,429
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disprove no pony and physics</font>

723
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:24,638
that giant underground<font color="#E5E5E5"> donut out there</font>

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,409
in CERN or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> huth who do you</font>

725
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,020
suppose hopes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Newtonian physics</font>

726
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:30,669
work more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody standing next to</font>

727
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,830
that metal tube and staring<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a bolt</font>

728
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,719
and saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I hope torsion and</font>

729
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,790
friction should really work because this

730
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,230
stuff flying around and here I want to

731
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,889
stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

732
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah I ought to disprove him but not</font>

733

00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:05,240
want to screw with a really horrible

784
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:08,180
wiki it sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on PV works for anybody who</font>

787
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,220
really quickly six and a half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

788
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,650
and now we have too much data to ever

789
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,790
move again and it's a non-standard wiki

790
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:22,940
and it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I refer to as</font>

791
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:25,279
software Stockholm Syndrome but it's the

792
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,950
one I know so it's there so you know

793
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,690
with that we've got a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

794
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:33,649
take me questions comments if you want

795
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,900
anybody have anybody that's missing

796
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,610
comments jeers if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted like reach</font>

797
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,620
out to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> any way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find me at</font>

798
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,420
shoulders there's a link or whatever if

799
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:45,830
they're people that need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be on there</font>

800
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,240
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody doesn't want to be on there</font>

801
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,920
that's on there I haven't had this yet

802
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,689
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't had a lot of current</font>

803
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,140
active people happy too you know tear it

804
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,150
right down so it's pretty

805
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,790
straightforward and it's how we got

806
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:03,560
there and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I do have a couple</font>

807
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:05,660
of closing comments this has come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

808
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,880
few times it's worth worth reflecting on

809
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:12,859
why is it called the shoulders of info

810
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,960
second so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> giants of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> info sick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I</font>

811
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to celebrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giants</font>

812
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,440
particularly giant egos what makes a

813
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:24,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference r is that that shoulder that</font>

814
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,230
we move forward our knowledge base grows

815
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,120
it's called shoulders of info SEC

816
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:33,590
because offering a shoulder is what's

817
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:37,069
important every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us can offer a</font>

818
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:39,080
shoulder to someone who needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to help</font>

819
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:41,720
them move forward and we all move

820
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:47,750
forward as a matter of fact I would

821
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:50,649
argue that offering shoulders is what

822
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,650
makes us gents

823
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,400
you
