23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,530
also as it was mentioned the adjunct

24
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,289
professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjunct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> professor at NYU</font>

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,090
polytechnic school of engineering where

26
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">I teach computer networking and also now</font>

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,090
I'm teaching application and security

28
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,060
because apparently they think I know

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,100
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I ran a oh hell once back in</font>

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,029
around on computers for a while security

33
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,908
they're going to be a lot of anime gifts

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,509
in this talk because I do run security

35
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,640
reactions and apparently that's what I

36
00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:00,189
mean it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I work for tumblr</font>

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,890
now because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get paid to run</font>

38
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,479
security not really and I also like I

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:06,219

with a major in computer cracking

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,280
hacking powers another thing that this

57
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,920
talk is not an endorsement or a

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,900
disavowal of any of the companies that

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,209
I've mentioned in this talker work for

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,380
it's more about my experiences because I

61
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,110
have worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of different</font>

62
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">industries and in a lot awarded a lot of</font>

63
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">different hats of one of which was</font>

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,130
apartment and is there anything else

66
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,900
let's talk about I'll figure it out

67
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,470
opposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pursue what what my slides</font>

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,720
say so how did I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into computer</font>

69
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,580
security I'd like i said before i be met

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,550
I'd been messing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with computers</font>

71
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,989
for since relatively young age and I

72
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,320
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

73
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for good mostly I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">get free calculators from an online</font>

75
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,209
website and then reselling them at

76
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,560
school wait I didn't I did I think the

77
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,200
statute<font color="#E5E5E5"> of limitations is over on that</font>

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,030
one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can admit that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you when I</font>

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,708
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in junior year of college I found</font>

80
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,410
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the scholarship program called</font>

81
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:40,900
scholarship for service or SF s where

82
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get two years of free school in</font>

83
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,110
exchange for selling your soul of the

84
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,429
government for two years so I was like

85
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,660
yeah you know my<font color="#CCCCCC"> school doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,370
have a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of value of them just</font>

87
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,570
do that because I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,560
could do this for a living I thought

89
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:57,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I was going to become a web</font>

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:59,019
developer which is awesome so like I

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,700
said I got the scholarship for service

92
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:04,450
and I had to work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government for</font>

93
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,730
two years so where did I go I went to

94
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,470
work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US Army it was not in the</font>

95
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,890
Army I was not a contract for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> army I</font>

96
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a civilian employee for the US Army</font>

97
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:17,469
what I did there so we worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sort</font>

98
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,870
of tactical oriented unit where we were

99
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,750
concerned with all of the networking

100
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,729
gear that gets sent out to when it went

101
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,590
a unit an army unit or whatever is

102
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,060
deployed I mean they need ways to get

103
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,669
their maps to get coordinates where they

104
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,910
need to go to get maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> any information</font>

105
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,169
about you know attacking you know

106
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,820
terrorist activity that's happening in

107
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,650
the area of people who may be gearing up

108
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,570
to attack them people that you know

109
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go look at</font>

110
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,380
whatever so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

111
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,710
networking

112
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,440
you also have a tax service and we were

113
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,409
concerned with two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things how secure are</font>

114
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,560
these security networking appliances and

115
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:01,660
also you know we there I heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rumor</font>

116
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,480
that China doesn't like us and it's also

117
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,700
where a lot of our equipment electronics

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,740
are being manufactured I don't know if

119
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:13,930
that's true or not but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

120
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,380
were fighting or we were getting at with

121
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">appliances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we were just breaking the</font>

122
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,159
 out of that pardon my french so the

123
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,110
great thing about that job was it was

124
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,210
research centric<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because we're like</font>

125
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey we're protecting the we're</font>

126
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,680
protecting the fighter we're protecting

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,510
her troops really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have to explain</font>

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,270
away too much about why we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

129
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,640
the money we needed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then pack all</font>

130
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,560
the things of the if any of you have

131
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,430
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk about hacking dlp that I do</font>

132
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,500
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zach linear or quine on Twitter the</font>

133
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,180
reason that I was inspired to pick up

134
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic and do it with Zach was I</font>

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,410
realized from this job that just because

136
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:58,419
it's a security appliance doesn't mean

137
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:01,660
it's secure I wrote my first remote root

138
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,450
exploit in this job which at 21 years

139
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,860
old is probably a little old for that

140
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,810
sort of thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still thought it was</font>

141
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,340
I you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to do</font>

142
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in her lifetime so that was awesome</font>

143
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security work</font>

144
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,530
straight at a school so from college

145
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,450
maybe two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months to get my interim</font>

146
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:24,010
clearance and right into this job that's

147
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome so for every job every awesome</font>

148
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">job there's always going to be the you</font>

149
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,370
know little<font color="#E5E5E5"> shadow or the things you</font>

151
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,420
little bit and like I said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

152
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to disrespect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> India's jobs every</font>

153
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,050
single job that I mentioned here still

154
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,719
has some of my former<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-workers still</font>

155
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,700
working there so obviously this is I

156
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean this US Army is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great job it's</font>

157
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,419
got job stability you know they usually

158
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,159
don't do layoffs for the government the

159
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,900
problem was and I didn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out</font>

160
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,030
so later is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pay that they were</font>

161
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,549
giving everyone because this is

162
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,859
the taxpayers dollar we want to not

163
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,750
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes taxes the celery's really</font>

164
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,840
weren't comparable to what I was seeing

165
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:10,930
in private industry or you know for

166
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,609
corporations or whatever the other thing

167
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,410
that is probably people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of find</font>

168
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,050
shocking at first but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of makes</font>

169
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:23,560
sense is if you find a bug on a system

170
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is a device that is running in a</font>

171
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,870
classified Network that vulnerability

172
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,919
immediately becomes classified and at

173
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,930
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font>

174
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,420
changed or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there really weren't any</font>

175
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,700
people with certificate our clearances

176
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,230
working at company so you say hey Cisco

177
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,909
we found a bug they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the</font>

178
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:46,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom we're like I can't tell you the</font>

179
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,310
secret we're so that's kind of cool in

180
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,020
one way because you have all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,640
day but it's kind of bad another way

182
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,740
because you're like the whole purpose

183
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,900
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect our troops and now we</font>

184
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,370
know about the bugs week sort of like

185
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you found the O'Day in your</font>

186
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:03,160
pacemaker so wrap yourself in tin foil

187
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,690
and hide in the closet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess and then</font>

188
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,460
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to talk to you I don't</font>

189
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,810
like I was kind of debating whether or

190
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,989
not to share this tale but I want tell

191
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:14,050
you about Jake Jake the flake it's not

192
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,130
real name just runs a flake whatever

193
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,580
Jake Jake was a flake Jake started to

194
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,560
kind of not show up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work maybe start</font>

195
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,599
serving out like twice a month then once

196
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,670
a week then one day<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just stopped</font>

197
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,380
showing up for work it took us three

198
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">months to get him fired which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

199
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,309
that's awesome if you actually do your

200
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">job and you have job security but then</font>

201
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,329
you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who comes in and is</font>

202
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,430
reading his newspaper all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

203
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,710
since then it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier to get</font>

204
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,020
fired from government jobs I don't I

205
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,400
don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

206
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,079
frustrating it where it was a little

207
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">frustrating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there but still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was an</font>

208
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,440
awesome job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the only reason</font>

209
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I started looking elsewhere is</font>

210
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,230
because they the government in an effort

211
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,050
to save<font color="#E5E5E5"> money does this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing called a</font>

212
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,620
brac it's like a reload they basically

213
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,390
try to consolidate army units or army

214
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,800
bases into one so they're like yet were

215
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,699
you

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,209
you guys are all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to move</font>

217
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to maryland and i didn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move to</font>

218
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:16,649
maryland I was already living in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

219
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,768
Jersey and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was worth that was bad</font>

220
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:21,630
enough so so I decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what else</font>

221
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:25,860
is out there this is about two and a

222
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:30,180
half years after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started so I and I</font>

223
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,980
apologize to any any<font color="#CCCCCC"> ron paul fans so i</font>

224
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,109
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey i have a clearance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

225
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,329
work for the federal reserve said that's

226
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,940
the former president that he dances like

227
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,529
that like in real life it's like all the

228
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,850
type that's how we get like it's like

229
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:47,160
come on then stop just sit down so this

230
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,660
was great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to leverage the</font>

231
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,399
fact that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> government experience</font>

232
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,719
and the weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about the Federal</font>

233
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,579
Reserve is that the Federal Reserve

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,589
where at least the federal reserve

235
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,300
branches are not actually government

236
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,610
branches they're considered nonprofit

237
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,660
government mandated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font>

238
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,190
that's actually a gov is the board so

239
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,100
Federal Reserve Bank of New York is sort

240
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,790
of like a weird hybrid of nonprofit

241
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,610
government finance this job was great

242
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,770
because there were a lot more people my

243
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,380
age<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we could go out drinking</font>

244
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,970
afterwards and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone here probably</font>

245
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,610
knows that drinking is essential if you

246
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">work in information security the</font>

247
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,730
work-life balance was great<font color="#CCCCCC"> they be I</font>

248
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,290
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a 35-hour workweek and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

249
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,000
you chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work longer you could</font>

250
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,890
basically take either every other friday

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,950
off or work from home a bunch of days a

252
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,300
week so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was cool and the great</font>

253
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,020
thing about the job at the fair reserve

254
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,390
was the bugs you find God fixed because

255
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,029
the people in house we're fixing them it

256
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:51,000
was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull me</font>

257
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,740
away less away from network related

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,290
stuff and more tech to application

259
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,209
security stuff we did do some network

260
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,130
security but that was usually handled by

261
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:01,229
other groups mostly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were concerned</font>

262
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the systems that move the</font>

263
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:09,690
money around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard that the federal</font>

264
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,329
reserve was really popular where is

265
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:14,670
still really popular because when the

266
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,859
finance crash they gave the money gave

267
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,059
all your money away did they do that oh

268
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,709
and also um

269
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,419
unlike and I'm going off on a tangent

270
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:31,689
here I mean there's up a red bull one

271
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:33,489
second mmm that's good a red bull so how

272
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:36,669
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here have seen die hard with</font>

273
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:38,049
a vengeance it's a good movie you can't

274
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:43,199
really steal gold out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Federal</font>

275
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:46,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reserve that way not that I tried but</font>

276
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,919
yeah there's no there's no tunnel that

277
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,679
leads to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Federal Reserve underground</font>

278
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,029
to that you can get the gold out of so

279
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,249
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also don't get locked in the vault</font>

280
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that happened to one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

281
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:58,479
one time and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only enough air in</font>

282
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,069
there for like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weekend he didn't die</font>

283
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,709
he was like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found him next day I</font>

284
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,659
don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but um</font>

285
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:06,638
anyway I going off on a tangent the bad

286
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:08,229
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it was you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

287
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,309
there's bad things about government you

288
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:12,609
know you hear about the red tape and

289
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:14,259
stuff and that stuff had here basically

290
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was like we were kind of working a</font>

291
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,619
finance lifestyle but we're still

292
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,329
getting paid government pay and it was a

293
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:26,499
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know especially living in New</font>

294
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:27,998
York it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive and we also</font>

295
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:29,529
had the same sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing where people</font>

296
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:32,769
there were some people there who just

297
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of and this is probably true for a</font>

298
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:35,349
lot of jobs were just some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

299
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,759
who just kind of checked out they'd been

300
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:39,189
there 20 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were just</font>

301
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of in a rut and the good thing</font>

302
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:44,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">about noticing that was I realized that</font>

303
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:47,319
I didn't ever want that to happen to me

304
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:49,239
my goal was as soon as I get bored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

305
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:50,498
job i start looking for a new job as

306
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:52,539
soon as I feel like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not learning</font>

307
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:55,359
anything new I start looking for a new

308
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:58,509
job because once this goes to mush it's

309
00:12:55,359 --> 00:13:00,159
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know I found this out once</font>

310
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,689
I left this job because like was kind of

311
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,899
becoming complacent I was there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

312
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:06,959
years once this starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away</font>

313
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,399
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back is kind of like</font>

314
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,518
relearning how to walk after you broken

315

your leg it's it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> crank it gets</font>

316

crampy it's like there's not enough red

317
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:24,609
bull for that so the Federal Reserve is

318
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,749
in the financial district area so I just

319
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:27,970
kind of walk down the street and was

320
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">like hey hire me no um but I ended up</font>

330
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,189
job was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this job made me a grain</font>

00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:08,009
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hack everything everything needs</font>

333
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:09,839
to be basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> has that kind of I don't</font>

334
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,480
know if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that as that has</font>

335
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,920
had some security problems in the past

336
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,819
because you know that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind</font>

337
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,339
of company that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

338
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:19,680
security problems is the one of the

339
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,509
companies that's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our</font>

340
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,069
country's economy they kind of basically

341
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:28,170
wipe the slate clean with respect to

342
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:31,529
their security team decided to kind of

343
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:36,269
you know scorch the earth and build over

344
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:38,550
so we were basically starting a security

345
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:40,050
team and that may seem frustrating but

346
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,670
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a lot of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn a</font>

347
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot when you're starting a security team</font>

348
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,889
especially from other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's fails and</font>

349
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you make your own fails which is</font>

350
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:53,910
embarrassing but also it's great for the

351
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,529
fact that you are you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

352
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the clock apart putting it</font>

353
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,560
back together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have a little</font>

354
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">little gear left and like what the</font>

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,229
hell'd sophomore and holy they

356
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:11,100
actually pay you money I like money<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

357
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">um but the cons of basically like by the</font>

358
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:19,350
skin<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your teeth always running as</font>

359
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:21,810
fast as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can everything is super time</font>

360
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,880
critical everyone's working super hard

361
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,680
all the time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,810
get a lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

363
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,689
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do it's not like the</font>

364
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,189
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you're just like a PT</font>

365
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:37,860
and they're like

366
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:39,510
should make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it rain um also you know</font>

367
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,280
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a publicly traded company you have</font>

368
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,710
to justify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money makin the money you</font>

369
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,839
lose so if the company is doing poorly

370
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,310
then what is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first what are</font>

371
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,770
the first things that get cut the

372
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,630
Prophet setups or I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry the non</font>

373
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,920
profit centers you know if you're not

374
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,230
making your money then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're costing</font>

375
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,790
them money and which is probably true

376
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,150
for pretty much every organization

377
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:02,640
except the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that sell you stuff</font>

378
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:05,160
security stuff like so all of the cool

379
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,630
vendors that are sponsoring us maybe

380
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,400
I'll go work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you someday so I know</font>

381
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,050
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually feels like for people</font>

382
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:14,189
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give you money for security</font>

383
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,750
maybe so there was a high burnout rate

384
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,480
to people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when you're working</font>

385
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,120
60 70 hours a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

386
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:34,350
so many people to do stuff you tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

387
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:36,750
get really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> over caffeinated so my</font>

388
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,610
goal for this talk is to get through it

389
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">without having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a heart attack by pissing</font>

390
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,300
my pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm probably gonna</font>

391
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:51,120
finish this can it's the why are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

392
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:54,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">trading um so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great job but I</font>

393
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,940
started get burnout maybe after about

394
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,560
two and a half years of I do like

395
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,710
working that way which we'll talk about

396
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,500
when we talk about where I ultimate land

397
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:09,060
it landed up but then I kind of was so

398
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,530
over stressed that my logic wasn't

399
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,589
working right and I ended up making a

400
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,589
bad move for me not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

401
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:21,629
a bad mood<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anyone I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to back to</font>

402
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:25,438
the kind of i went to a large bank with

403
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:28,950
a large large security team and became a

404
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">paper pusher that was so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't really</font>

405
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">say a lot about this job just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

406
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,530
really wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cup of tea like it's</font>

407
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,270
necessary to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all that stuff you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

408
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,629
to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are compliant</font>

409
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,070
with pci compliant with HIPAA compliant

410
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,429
with whatever the hell that you need to

411
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be compliant with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't like it I</font>

412
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:52,980
don't like non tech

413
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff um it it just goes about as well</font>

414
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:00,390
as his talk was going right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now um so</font>

415
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,090
basically I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't it was like</font>

416
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,290
it kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew maybe after about three</font>

417
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,149
or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really wasn't</font>

418
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,470
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was not something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

419
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,580
wanted I know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this is why I'm</font>

420
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,049
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about pros and cons</font>

421
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,439
because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

422
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:15,660
really experienced enough to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

423
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk about it because I don't</font>

424
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,570
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be fair to citibank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

425
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,059
don't think it would be fair to banks in

426
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,299
general about what the lifestyle is like

427
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,070
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know what the job is like</font>

428
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,379
because working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a job that's not for</font>

429
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,049
you is basically like yeah I worked at

430
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,910
Burger King when I was 17 and I really

431
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,940
like french fries but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes people</font>

432
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:38,880
yell<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really can't</font>

433
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,620
speak intelligently to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not implying</font>

434
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm speaking intelligently now but now i</font>

435
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,770
work for tumblr and as evidenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

436
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,739
fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i run security reactions and</font>

437
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,440
this presentation is full of gifts these

438
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,450
are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know kind of we</font>

439
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,669
dig the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same stuff right and</font>

440
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about tumblr being a</font>

441
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,049
very small organization it's maybe about

442
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,750
300 people is that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mess</font>

443
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:06,418
something up when you break code or when

444
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,100
you break the site or when you write

445
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,890
something that's vulnerable everyone

446
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,860
knows who did it and that led to a very

447
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,460
savvy culture of security basically you

448
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,000
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be the guy or the gal who</font>

449
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:25,350
pushed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know merged the branch</font>

450
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,910
and github that caused the whole site to

451
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable to cross-site scripting or</font>

452
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,520
cross-site request forgery or whatever

453
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,929
the bug is also things change quickly so

454
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,250
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always working on new stuff all</font>

455
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:40,650
the time one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be you know</font>

456
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,090
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more security features</font>

457
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,130
built to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site so i'll actually be</font>

458
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,909
doing some coding sometimes I'll be

459
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:50,460
helping developers architect developers

460
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,350
architects their own code to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

461
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,330
that they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it securely sometimes</font>

462
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,209
they'll be messing around with network

463
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,740
stuff working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the network team</font>

464
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,810
the perimeter<font color="#E5E5E5"> team to make sure that</font>

465
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,440
they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their fire whirl rules and</font>

466
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,760
their detection and everything properly

467
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,760
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll just be adding more</font>

468
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,470
submissions to the security reactions no

469
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,420
my boss actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will sometimes say oh</font>

470
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,340
there's no there hasn't been any<font color="#CCCCCC"> updates</font>

471
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,480
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put more gifts in the gift box</font>

472
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,580
and like okay that's the cause of this

473
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,680
is it's a small staff it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> start-up we</font>

474
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,139
still have to prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world that</font>

475
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,060
we're capable of making money prove to

476
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">our overlords at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo that we're</font>

477
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,560
capable of making them money so the

478
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,800
budget stays small we can't go out and

479
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,649
buy and buy fancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> network appliances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

480
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:41,060
or by whack to put in front of our stuff

481
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:44,090
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy you know a fancy box to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tech</font>

482
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,310
of all the bad people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in</font>

483
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,189
or the bad people who have maybe owned a

484
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,409
laptop and trying to move around network

485
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,470
we can't do that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

486
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to make our own stuff or use open</font>

487
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,870
source or stuff which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great but</font>

488
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,520
because you know there's never been any

489
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:08,149
vulnerability as an open source source

490
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,440
software ever ever yes actually one of

491
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good things I'll talk of actually</font>

492
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,510
about a pro about city by city bank when

493
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,310
hurtfully came out citibank was not

494
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,760
vulnerable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hartley because they don't</font>

495
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:21,710
use openssl anywhere like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even in</font>

496
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,200
any of their networking stuff and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

497
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,760
like all my friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> are up until three</font>

498
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,430
in the morning and I'm just like they're

499
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,820
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you doing I'm like</font>

500
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,810
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix eatin tacos don't like</font>

501
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,360
aren't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about heart bleeding</font>

502
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:41,960
like I'm more worried about this taco

503
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,969
get my mouth that also things changing

504
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,380
quickly is great it's good to keep you

505
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,240
on your toes it's good to keep you

506
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,040
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work you're doing but</font>

507
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,350
things change quickly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

508
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,690
watch everybody so things will get out

509
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,580
that are bad we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta run try to find</font>

510
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:02,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who fixed it and smack them around a</font>

511
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:04,460
bit also you can't send to two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks to</font>

512
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,250
a month doing your code review of your

513
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,730
pen test you don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you</font>

514
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,020
know we have

515
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,730
future that we want to get out we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

516
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,250
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out you know this year we</font>

517
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,320
don't run as slowly as let's say a bag

518
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,590
or the government where you know things

519
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:24,139
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for things to take a while you</font>

520
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:25,909
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like okay so the we're</font>

521
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,520
changing the font on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ATM it's not</font>

522
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,140
like a big deal a lot of the stuff that

523
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,910
you work under the bank or in the

524
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,270
government is not really customer-facing

525
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,800
so getting it you know get it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

526
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,540
you can take the time to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

527
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,159
it's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right that that's not</font>

528
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right a</font>

529
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">tumblr it's just that you can't have</font>

530
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:48,800
everybody waiting for the four-person

531
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:52,580
security team<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be like oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so this</font>

532
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">line of code is slightly uninvented and</font>

533
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think that you're using parameterize</font>

534
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,710
queries but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't read every single</font>

535
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,879
place that you're doing talking to the

536
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,560
database so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to need another</font>

537
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to do that and also I'd like to you</font>

538
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,030
know run some what is what it was the

539
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,100
stuff that they're debating at yesterday

540
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,960
well we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the money for dynamic</font>

541
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis tools so i guess that's a moot</font>

542
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:20,870
point yeah anyway tumblr is great you

543
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:23,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">should work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tumblr we're hiring so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

544
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,429
did this in emojis because I'm a woman

545
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,260
and I love emojis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also work for</font>

546
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,090
tumblr i love emojis so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

547
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,080
places that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked I didn't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

548
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk up a little bit about the</font>

549
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,820
differences to kind of get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from you</font>

550
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pros and the cons and all of</font>

551
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,490
that stuff so the first one so we have

552
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,940
dynamics basically how rapidly the

553
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,790
environment changes how much freedom you

554
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,220
have to kind of do your own stuff what

555
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,580
the security budget is like what

556
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,900
staffing is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know some places</font>

557
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,659
they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hire a little bit more</font>

558
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,730
easily than others and how technical the

559
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,700
job was and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the technical in</font>

560
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,790
coffee cups and also amounts of alcohol

561
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:09,320
consumed so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to</font>

562
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:12,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">really explain that further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font>

whether you agree with that or not I

584
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:14,690
know it's very controversial especially

585
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:16,999
amongst a largely libertarian crowd at

586
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,919

super-technical the federal reserve was

661
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,760
a little bit less technical but

662

becomes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peyton but to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nasdaq the things that we usually looked</font>

709
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,290
at were all internally built the we

710
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,790
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really worry concern ourselves</font>

711
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,710
with the networking stuff that was

712
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:49,680
usually another team so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

713
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:52,590
usually to get that stuff fixed it may

714
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,160
take three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months it may take six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

715
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:59,699
but it usually eventually got fixed

716
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,850
there was also a in<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say nasdaq</font>

fell reserve and citibank that whole

718
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:07,469
kind of the one of the biggest things we

719
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,120
had to combat was the let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just accept</font>

720
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the risk on that one because we don't</font>

721
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,919
want to fix it mentality that is

722
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,899
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really hard to combat</font>

726
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:25,949
was the proof of concept or GTFO

727
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,390
mentality where they're like oh yeah
