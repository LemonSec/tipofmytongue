1
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:25,190
you know as bunky mentioned culture of

2
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,229
security is important and I had been to

3
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,900
a few security conferences myself

4
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,119
especially a DEFCON where people are

5
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,940
like super geeky and you know like

6
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,010
they're like geniuses on air and I was

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,099
like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a presentation but</font>

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,710
what should I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so okay culture</font>

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,960
is universal you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody can talk</font>

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it even if you haven't built our</font>

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,940
latest coolest tool so that's why I

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:57,890
chose this topic so just share my story

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,229
and like as this slide says you know

14
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:05,059
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one sign but it means different</font>

15
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:07,820
things for different people and that is

16
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,280
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenges maybe once people</font>

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,250
one sector is developers one sec<font color="#CCCCCC"> teresa</font>

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,890
side means one sector is management<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,049
poor infosec on the other side so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:26,420
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share my story you know</font>

21
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:30,910
so back in 2005 2007 I was at New York

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,970
City<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for Goldman Sachs and</font>

23
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:37,160
it was at Wall Street I was in wolf of

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall straight I was more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like sheep</font>

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,640
of the wall street you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was</font>

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,220
high-pressure environment for all of us

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,700
you know people worked hard and played

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:53,900
hard and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was high power power</font>

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:58,370
processing and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about socks and</font>

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:02,360
separation of duties but when it is 259

31
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:04,880
p.m. and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss the feed you know</font>

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,460
the company loses a million dollars like

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,158
10 managing directors are around your

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,859
desk the developer updates a production

35
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:14,569
database directly because who cares

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">about compliance when the company is</font>

37
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:23,929
losing money so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed compliance</font>

38
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,420
anyways so next I went to I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,170
a break so i went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more</font>

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,989
relaxed environment the neighboring

41
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,940
state kinetic

42
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,070
it was a beautiful place called New

43
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,870
London the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> was called Pfizer and</font>

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:44,489
instead of Wall Street bankers we had

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,070
mad scientists so they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking</font>

46
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,600
around their lab coats and they were

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">well respected we didn't know what was</font>

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through their head and funny story</font>

49
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:59,850
a parking lot was called viagra so

50
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,340
anyways that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest money honor</font>

51
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,850
for the company so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a lot of</font>

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,220
respect um so we manage documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pfizer</font>

53
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:12,120
over period of time had acquired little

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:15,450
labs from different companies so we were

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,550
managing all these documents and FDA was

56
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">a word that would make everyone shiver</font>

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:26,040
so that was another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned then</font>

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:30,390
after that moves to a colder place of

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,840
flattered place<font color="#E5E5E5"> snuggled away among</font>

60
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,589
sprawling<font color="#CCCCCC"> cornfields in midwest america</font>

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,560
the company was state farm insurance and

62
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:45,660
here the rock stars were the insurance

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,880
agents so we respected insurance agents

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:52,710
because they sold policies and they

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,799
brought in the money and of course we

66
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,200
had a lot of mainframe systems and it

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,180
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> rack of security we had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of b2b</font>

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,609
integration with OnStar and other

69
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,920
companies you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling policies</font>

70
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,380
buying policies on mobile phone was

71
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,480
getting popular and there was a

72
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:17,430
occasional you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know double indemnity</font>

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:21,510
kind of occurrences so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

74
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:24,570
moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coolest place 2012 or stay</font>

75
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:31,140
in the funnest place I've ever been to

76
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:33,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know and yeah it wasn't cold he</font>

77
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,070
could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and if state farm</font>

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,410
insurance was like the mother of

79
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,020
processes and procedures because at

80
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,020
state farm people I have one state<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

81
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,580
colleague whom I met outside but he's

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,710
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but</font>

83
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,840
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important thing was</font>

84
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability of systems like the systems</font>

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,580
have to be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell policies</font>

86
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:59,099
confidentiality was not so important but

87
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,310
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was super in a lot of processes I</font>

88
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:06,060
joined this company where processes were

89
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:09,270
not that important the game developers

90
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,050
were the new rock stars you know they

91
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:15,750
would sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on their beach and you know</font>

92
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,729
create games open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and you could</font>

93
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">install anything on their system and</font>

94
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:24,030
people have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of not more access so</font>

95
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,400
and if the gamers ain't happy nobody's

96
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,888
happy and there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of risk</font>

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,929
because if the game doesn't succeed the

98
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,949
studios are going to fall down so there

99
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:39,090
was great risk ahead so with that I

100
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:42,599
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what is culture that is</font>

101
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:46,169
the culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I saw from new york to</font>

102
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">connecticut to Illinois to Austin so</font>

103
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,180
there's a cool slide on culture

104
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:56,900
so here is so as we read culture is a

105
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,909
collective treasure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

106
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,179
collective memory of our perception of

107
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:06,129
ourselves so if you have to map it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:09,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">company what is the collective treasure</font>

109
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:11,779
it's like the data assets you know our

110
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:15,199
job titles are our perception of

111
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,710
ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm the president I own the</font>

112
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:22,189
company if i'm a poor system analyst

113
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,710
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much it's the acquired</font>

114
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:30,650
pair of glasses through which we see

115
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:32,960
life and our stories are made up with

116
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,830
our bittersweet experiences if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,818
happy at work if you are overworked if

118
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:43,279
our managers are demanding you know we

119
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,810
spend most time at work and if you are

120
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,389
tired at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day somebody</font>

121
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,919
sends us a link which says you won a

122
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,620
million dollars or I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> your manager</font>

123
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,330
giving you a vacation to Hawaii I have

124
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,439
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for six days straight i'll</font>

125
00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:01,219
probably click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link and so what</font>

126
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:06,400
unites us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company mission vision and</font>

127
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:06,400
values security policies and standards

128
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,180
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more we know about the</font>

129
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,889
culture of others<font color="#CCCCCC"> so other departments</font>

130
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,279
developers everybody brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

131
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:22,610
strength it's not my<font color="#CCCCCC"> way or the highway</font>

132
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,219
it's your way and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk your</font>

133
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:29,149
way these are the lessons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i learned</font>

134
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:34,360
learned the hard way so before we

135
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:34,360
proceed let's take our quiz

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anybody would like to take a guess</font>

137
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is the average estimated cost per</font>

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,730
record of a data breach sorry okay it's

139
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,279
actually somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle it</font>

140
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,200
really depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

141
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:05,630
breach but as a volume goes up the cost

142
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,790
goes up<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down but on the mean</font>

143
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:12,680
is 58 cents now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want how long does it</font>

144
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:21,130
take for an attacker to compromise your

145
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:28,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">system seconds is that the answer yes</font>

146
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:30,140
that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer how long does it take</font>

147
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:37,070
for an attacker to walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

148
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:39,439
data minutes yes most most of the times

149
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:45,320
twenty-eight percent of cases it took

150
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:47,089
the attack at less than a minute how

151
00:09:45,320 --> 00:10:00,290
many vulnerabilities do you need to

152
00:09:47,089 --> 00:10:02,029
defend against actually are there were

153
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:07,640
seven million but you know that will

154
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:09,439
come to more details<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that so what was</font>

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:16,449
the common age of vulnerability is seen

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:18,610
in 2014 be

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:26,500
sorry to say a grief you got the wrong

158
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:29,280
answer yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from verizon data</font>

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,990
breach report and the funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

160
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:38,439
most of the vulnerabilities like the SI

161
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:43,090
VES were from 1999 to 2002 range you

162
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,720
know SNMP version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 windows rdp ftp</font>

163
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,870
protocols because we don't use them

164
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,440
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks they're still there and</font>

165
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,440
they're a good gateway

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:11,430
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst that it can</font>

167
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:14,410
be so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are twenty-three percent so</font>

168
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:19,209
since I was studying about culture I

169
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:21,430
thought like a lot of cultural incidents

170
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,250
have happened because of insider attacks

171
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:28,170
you know so I thought let's say I'm an

172
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:32,110
angry person in the room like this guy

173
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:34,870
yeah I grew up in a tough culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

174
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,800
not treated right I decided to switch

175
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,389
hats it's payback time so I look up the

176
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:50,109
data breach opposed to see who's

177
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:52,269
succeeding and you know like you're

178
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">always pointing our fingers to you know</font>

179
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:58,839
other places but like one of the fourth

180
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:02,110
top one is the insider miss you so one

181
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,970
among<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten people are going to do that so</font>

182
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:10,800
if in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are like 50 people</font>

183
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,800
you know maybe I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Matt 1.25 oh</font>

184
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:22,630
yes bank so so how would an insider

185
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:26,259
insider create an attack insider could

186
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:32,290
use fishing because an insider is

187
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:35,199
trusted and fishing is a favorite tactic

188
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,699
because everything said and done<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

189
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:43,479
email ports are always open<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

190
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:46,508
the attacker he is not really trying to

191
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your information or my information</font>

192
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:52,079
what is the attacker trying to do when

193
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,079
he's sending a fishing link

194
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,240
the attacker is basically trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

195
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:08,010
establish a foothold into your complete

196
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,530
organization so and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cyber</font>

197
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:16,020
espionage events have<font color="#E5E5E5"> featured fishing</font>

198
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:19,079
fishing and it says like the data showed

199
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,990
that nearly fifty percent of users open

200
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:30,030
emails and click on fishing links within

201
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:32,280
the first one hour and who are the

202
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:36,060
people who are mostly targeted for

203
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:38,670
phishing attacks not the security

204
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,949
professional but maybe somebody who has

205
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,310
to open pdfs every day as a part of his

206
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,770
job responsibility so like the customer

207
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:50,790
support people the HR who has to look at

208
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:55,130
resumes what can she do she has to look

209
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,130
at it so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do in such cases</font>

210
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:07,590
yeah sandbox a system not give them

211
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:16,050
admin rights and of course security

212
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:19,710
awareness training sorry so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font>

213
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:24,390
was vulnerabilities and the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

214
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:26,280
vulnerabilities were as I said you know

215
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,000
like the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten see bees were like</font>

216
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:34,290
Microsoft Windows XP Windows 2000 XSS

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,080
directory traversal rdp ssl these were

218
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:42,750
all if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the year range there</font>

219
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:45,170
from 1999 to 2002 so the attackers are

220
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,670
don't really have to work hard you know

221
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,979
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go out and create the</font>

222
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:57,930
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero-day it's like a million days</font>

223
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:02,360
so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um angry guy wants to</font>

224
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:06,959
create more attacks stolen credentials

225
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,339
surprisingly you know are the root cause

226
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:12,300
of ninety-five percent

227
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,579
of web attacks and we were when we were

228
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,649
discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in our group study you</font>

229
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,829
know like we go to discount electronics

230
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,449
or goodwill and by the computers which

231
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:23,189
are sitting out there you know somebody

232
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">said I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and sold it off</font>

233
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:28,709
but that users information is still

234
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">sitting there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and someone shared a story</font>

235
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:35,819
like even the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police department they</font>

236
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:37,470
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling out their printers but the</font>

237
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:42,389
scanned information was still available

238
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the spool you know so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

239
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:51,180
two-factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication can be helpful</font>

240
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:55,160
using password manager can be helpful so

241
00:15:51,180 --> 00:16:01,680
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to our angry insider</font>

242
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">privileged abuse mostly the cases where</font>

243
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,878
we have seen insider attacks are more

244
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">ardis industries public health care and</font>

245
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:14,129
financial services<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you look at</font>

246
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart you know the end user is</font>

247
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:19,279
targeted the most and then there are

248
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:24,719
some sis admin's and other people and

249
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,399
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it was fifty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,149
privileged abuse where there were

251
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,519
internal actors involved so sometimes

252
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of looking far away to the other</font>

253
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">corner of the globe maybe we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should look</font>

254
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,899
inside our company and see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

255
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:43,740
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would reduce some security</font>

256
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:48,829
threats anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> I give too much</font>

257
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:51,749
information let's take a deep breath so

258
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:54,329
let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to this angry guy and he</font>

259
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:56,490
was like why is he angry because he is

260
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:59,040
not happy at his work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I searched</font>

261
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,420
like what are the factors and then make

262
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,369
you happy at about you at your work so

263
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,289
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Boston</font>

264
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:10,408
Consulting Group you know take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

265
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,799
to read this then we implement it in

266
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,799
your company

267
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:28,178
you know surprisingly appreciation for

268
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:33,908
work is number one and salary is number

269
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:36,279
eight so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much importance are we</font>

270
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:40,539
paying to this when we are getting the

271
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:45,970
latest shiny tool these are so security

272
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:50,710
is all about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attitude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little guy</font>

273
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">is using the big winner so these are</font>

274
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best practices that have</font>

275
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,289
been implemented by companies that have

276
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:02,139
made this<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtle changes so one they</font>

277
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,940
have made security regional so today's

278
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:06,609
world there are a global companies in

279
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,850
all different parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the world instead</font>

280
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:12,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you being in Peoria Illinois and</font>

281
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,029
telling people<font color="#CCCCCC"> all over the world in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

282
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,999
know Eastern Europe what to do why don't

283
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,950
you make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> regional why don't you trust</font>

284
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:24,899
the people who speak the language to

285
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to the local developers their</font>

286
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:30,779
business continuity drills you know how

287
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tabletop exercises do we do like</font>

288
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:37,470
just pen and paper what if this blows up

289
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:39,759
what if this happens not enough I think

290
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">business training for security</font>

291
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:46,389
professionals is not the other way

292
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:48,039
around it's like we as security need to

293
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:51,580
understand who are the rock stars in

294
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this company who bring in brings in the</font>

295
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">moola and then security awareness the</font>

296
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:03,159
study<font color="#E5E5E5"> has showed that lot of companies</font>

297
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:05,649
trust their own security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team to create</font>

298
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,409
the security awareness training but

299
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:11,559
somehow the message is more well

300
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:14,859
received when an separate communication

301
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,440
team is doing that because that probably

302
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:21,220
leads more credibility to the situation

303
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,499
and then the fifth one is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

304
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,590
because what if you don't agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

305
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:27,580
what your manager says you know at the

306
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,060
end of the day he is

307
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,949
performance review but sometimes we have

308
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,129
to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courage to stand up and say</font>

309
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:41,500
I don't agree that you are ignoring all

310
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:46,390
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1999 2002 CVEs because they don't</font>

311
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,140
have a cool logo yeah so anyways so

312
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:54,040
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> but verify and so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

313
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:56,470
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical steps you know the</font>

314
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,649
admin group in your company should not

315
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:02,200
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any people in it because that's the</font>

316
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,740
first place the attackers look for the

317
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,830
administrator group flash java and all

318
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,590
the rest of possibilities from time

319
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:16,060
immemorial shared admin credentials in

320
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,830
your company<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'm sure if you're</font>

321
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,360
honest here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

322
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,370
admins have the common credential

323
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,669
through which the login it may be root

324
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:27,639
it maybe take it may be admin but that's

325
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,470
a violation of basic security policy so

326
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,380
use lieberman or something where they

327
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:36,390
can not promoting any vendor but use

328
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,190
some kind of temporary access instead of

329
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,930
monitoring and alerting like in target

330
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,550
they were doing monitoring and alerting

331
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:47,380
but they were not being alert about it

332
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:51,159
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just monitoring so look at the</font>

333
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:53,860
logs and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps on it threat</font>

334
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,520
modeling you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out what the</font>

335
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,340
attacker is going to go for water star

336
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,680
what is the treasure jewel what is your

337
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,260
crown jewel in your company what is the

338
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,540
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> precious thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your company it</font>

339
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,210
may vary from company to company if it's

340
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:13,030
a government<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else and then</font>

341
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,910
segmentation of networks you know leave

342
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,330
your dirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> network aside have the clean</font>

343
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:21,070
network and you know have those segments

344
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,240
clearly defined have proper access

345
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:29,169
control rules so anyways those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

346
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,100
technical steps so I thought you know

347
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:36,130
since we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I studied like what are</font>

348
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,350
the six indicators of happiness again

349
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,340
coming back to happiness so the first

350
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,689
this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Universal</font>

351
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,750
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

352
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,200
fulfill all the six great areas the

353
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,720
first is held by help if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

354
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,419
translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the computer world as I</font>

355
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,559
patch it don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> CVEs you know that's</font>

356
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:59,720
good health second is youthfulness we

357
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:03,129
have to have a you know youthful spirit

358
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,409
we learn more<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I have to translate</font>

359
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,779
discard your obsolete systems you know

360
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,210
know what you need and get rid of the

361
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:14,179
old stuff have a data classification

362
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,919
policy third is good fortune some

363
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,590
companies I just plain lucky they

364
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,179
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been hacked you know or maybe</font>

365
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:25,220
they have been hiked they don't know so

366
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:31,039
you can call you good fortune good karma

367
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:33,200
or whatever fourth is wisdom you know do

368
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,990
your own periodic scans to your audits

369
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,409
know where your crown jewels by know

370
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,690
what the attacker will go for this are

371
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:43,820
universal criteria so you can take it

372
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,039
anywhere 50s passion and by passion I

373
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,710
meant like you know your manager trusts

374
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:52,190
you you get training you can work from

375
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,020
home you have flexibility it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a</font>

376
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,429
healthy environment to work in not where

377
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:59,510
everybody hates each other you know

378
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:01,789
giant<font color="#E5E5E5"> egos or something six is</font>

379
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,500
conviction you know know what you need

380
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:09,049
deploy only what you need and have

381
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">defense-in-depth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lease privileged some</font>

382
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:15,049
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm stretching a little bit so</font>

383
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:18,770
so what's the conclusion a heartbeat

384
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:21,649
company is a secure company happy person

385
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:24,309
