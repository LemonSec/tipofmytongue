2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,070
I'm pretty loud so usually isn't too big

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,930
of an issue so yeah thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really happy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here I'm who here is</font>

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,040
this is their first security conference

6
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:35,750
good this is actually my first security

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,220
conference too I'm not normally kind of

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,449
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security world and I don't know</font>

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,370
if that was the reason why you know

10
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:41,750
James wanted me to talk here but you

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,580
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk more kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of in the devil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> op</font>

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,960
spaces and you know we talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting developers and operators working</font>

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,710
better together and that always bugged

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,000
me in the earlier days of DevOps because

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,800
I was always thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what about</font>

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,710
you know QA teams what about support

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,300
team sales marketing you know executive

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,469
teams what about security teams what

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,300
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these other groups of the</font>

21
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,440
business that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably also not</font>

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,968
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> well together how do we get</font>

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,110
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> together and we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

24
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,539
the years it's been more of a cultural

25
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,369
shift company-wide needed to really

26
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:09,619
adopt a lot of the DevOps practices so

27
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,060
so real<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick just who I am just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peach s</font>

28
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:12,649
lock you can find me on Twitter I<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a company called threat stack who</font>

30
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:18,740
here who does not know me as heard of

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,170
threat stack before awesome this is

32
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,390
actually good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like you know clean</font>

33
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,530
room of people so I work for coming all

34
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,789
threats to a queer new company we

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,720
started last year we're based out of

36
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:31,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">boston massachusetts and we do a</font>

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,020
continuous security monitoring looking

38
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,190
for internal threats external threats

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,149
and other stuff if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're curious for</font>

40
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,979
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd love to chat with you about it</font>

41
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the most important part is again I'm</font>

42
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,050
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an infosec person I've never really</font>

43
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,340
been in that space in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that community</font>

44
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,990
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been more of an operations person</font>

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,250
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sales engineer I've been a</font>

46
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,089
network person I've been kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

47
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,310
over the place and so this talk is a lot

48
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,530
of what I've actually had to learn on

49
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,179
you know on demand while working at

50
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,520
threat stack while scaling our platform

51
00:01:56,179 --> 00:02:02,959
from ingesting essentially zero events

52
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,160
into billions of events per day so James

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,910
asked me to talk and this I was like

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">really are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need like why I'm not a</font>

55
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,200
security person like what do I have to

56
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">say and he was like well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font>

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,000
talking more about DevOps and how to get

58
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,200
people to work together and so more

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,599
recently what I've seen though if you

60
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,429
look at DevOps days conferences of which

61
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,679
there's like 20 of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> now every year</font>

62
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,150
you'll see more security content coming

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,100
out more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are talking about it as</font>

64
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,350
more and more issues are happening but

65
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,210
if you look back in older conferences

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,190
older talks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-velocity web</font>

67
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,020
operations you know systems engineering

68
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,250
stuff no one's talking about security it

69
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,200
was always like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do things</font>

70
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,660
faster and faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> faster that was</font>

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,670
most most of thing so I'm only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

72
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,900
spend one time one slide on what is

73
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,089
DevOps and it's a great quote from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

74
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,730
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine oh man I sorry for that</font>

75
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,050
animation I hate those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so this</font>

76
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably the best quotes I've seen</font>

77
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,200
about DevOps is from a friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine he</font>

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,090
says you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps means giving a</font>

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,739
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job enough to not pass the</font>

80
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,910
buck it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving a about your</font>

81
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,140
job enough to want to learn all the

82
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,370
parts your business I think this

83
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,290
actually applies as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

84
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,060
security as well and in security teams

85
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,140
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm an Operations person</font>

86
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,240
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to ignore the</font>

87
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,619
security aspect and that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

88
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,670
know if I don't know it I need to learn

89
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,860
it and that's why I love coming to

90
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,859
events like this to learn from you know

91
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,940
community so in the past I have had to

92
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,770
work with auditors I've had to go

93
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,620
through audit to myself and I've worked

94
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with dedicated info SEC teams I realized</font>

95
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think we're reaching this</font>

96
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,800
inflection point where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to start</font>

97
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing how security teams are kind of</font>

98
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,520
off in their own silo with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

99
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,770
know dev ops teams dev and ops teams

100
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,120
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's happening now</font>

101
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,180
is some of those walls are getting

102
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,040
broken down if you've been to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of</font>

103
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">a DevOps e-type talk you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
this wall confusion in the past it was

105
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,560
the dev on one side of the ops on the

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,880
other side and I think what's happened

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,140
now is you know the dev and ops like

108
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,670
they're all happy and they're they're

109
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,720
doing all this continuous fun stuff and

110
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,190
the security team is on the other side

111
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,320
and they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting all this stuff</font>

112
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,760
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thrown over to them so the dev</font>

113
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,170
and the ops they're living in perfect

114
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,910
harmony right they're embracing change

115
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,700
they're embracing continuous delivery

116
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,829
and and maybe the info SEC team isn't

117
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,500
being included maybe the info SEC team

118
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,820
doesn't want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> included before the</font>

119
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,710
DevOps conversation really started

120
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,570
operations teams did generally didn't

121
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,730
like change because change brought in

122
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,649
stability and instability will come up

123
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,970
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the null denied so James actually</font>

124
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,789
talked about the broke the internet one

125
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,350
I I kind of I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know put the little</font>

126
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,180
overlay on top and I guess it was like

127
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,920
haha that's funny and then like it got

128
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,480
on the internet and people loved<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

129
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is this is what it feels</font>

130
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,800
like right for info SEC teams change

131
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,450
brings fear it brings uncertainty and

132
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,970
since you never included<font color="#E5E5E5"> your info SEC</font>

133
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,159
team in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy new continuous build</font>

134
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,740
pipeline you have all the software now

135
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,069
that is largely untested

136
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,210
for vulnerabilities so Security's on the

137
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,610
minds of everyone I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

138
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,888
follows the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Food Lab I love to cook and</font>

139
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,979
so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like when the food</font>

140
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:56,050
lab guy is saying hey FYI like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Go Go is</font>

141
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,150
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically hijacking your SSL</font>

142
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,069
connections you'll keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in mind I</font>

143
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,060
think we're at a point where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font>

144
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:06,300
everyone's mind it should be on

145
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:09,430
everyone's mind in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company so yeah</font>

146
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,930
so I noticed one thing when I started

147
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,449
getting added security stuff I didn't

148
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a lot about security and I was</font>

149
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,630
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more about it and I</font>

150
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,609
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are the things that</font>

151
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,080
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing which is washing your</font>

152
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,729
hands and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

153
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,889
insecurities that I think I see a lot of

154
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing instead things like emergency the</font>

155
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,130
cocaine tooth drops a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that</font>

156
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,990
probably are not actually helping you

157
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,690
out and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what this</font>

158
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk today represents is that I i really</font>

159
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,930
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to teach you if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to</font>

160
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,520
wash your hands essentially more likely

161
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,110
i'm actually gonna tell you about how i

162
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,840
learned to wash my hands while operating

163
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,460
the threats tag platform but i know a

164
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,229
lot of keynote talks or more vague and

165
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,580
kind of give you some ideas to go on but

166
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,409
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

167
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,758
i'm actually to dive into as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well and my</font>

168
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">only hope is that there might be some</font>

169
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,250
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna look at be like oh</font>

170
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,870
that's beginner stuff like you know

171
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're already doing that but it's</font>

172
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,930
probably not beginner to someone because

173
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,300
last year a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff in the talk</font>

174
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,860
i was like oh yeah sure like ssl i guess

175
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,250
we should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right but what does</font>

176
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,460
that really mean so I'm a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> westwind</font>

177
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,530
fan anyone here like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the West Wing</font>

178
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,940
couple hands all right the west winds a

179
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,880
great show i mean i usually get a few

180
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,770
more hands of that but so there's a

181
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,090
great quote from it the most costly

182
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,289
disruptions always happen when something

183
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,409
that we take completely for granted

184
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:23,080
stops working for a minute and when i

185
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,460
saw this when i when i experienced an

186
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,370
issue a few months ago this quote just

187
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like came to came to my mind so i was</font>

188
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,280
working in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our platform a new version</font>

189
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,539
of linux kernel came out and it was a

190
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">security update so i'm thinking myself</font>

191
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right I'm a security minded person</font>

192
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,270
i'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> start baking some new images</font>

193
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,810
starting testing it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ran into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

194
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,889
very interesting bug so with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

195
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,020
version of the kernel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was running</font>

196
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:46,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bunch of specific if you're</font>

197
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,490
curious which is supposed to be security

198
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,169
update only if you ran any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tool</font>

199
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,659
that integrated with the colonel audit

200
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,080
API system like an audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> v or like our</font>

201
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,509
threats

202
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">asia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you enter into a scenario where no</font>

203
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,590
one including the root user could

204
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,568
actually run commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fork processes</font>

205
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,969
so it was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure security update</font>

206
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:05,289
you couldn't actually do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> um now</font>

207
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,389
you think yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine I'll</font>

208
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:09,159
just log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the console and you know I</font>

209
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,229
reboot to the old version Colonel this

210
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:13,120
is in the cloud I don't have a console

211
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,219
you just have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like nucleus boxes and</font>

212
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,229
they build them so but you see that to

213
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:19,719
upgrade my security upgrade my<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel</font>

214
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,789
with a security release to make my

215
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:23,229
system more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure but it'll it'll now</font>

216
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,150
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it unstable but only if I'm</font>

217
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,639
actually running a tool that is supposed

218
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help me stay secure so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we</font>

219
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,729
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have nice things because I'm</font>

220
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,979
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do these very simple things to</font>

221
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,719
stay secure and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know getting blocked</font>

222
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,039
along the way so you say you're building

223
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,419
secure systems but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

224
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's something that you're already</font>

225
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:41,318
using today isn't fundamentally broken

226
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,030
we use lots of software lots of open

227
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,560
source software and we depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

228
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,719
keep us safe online to keep our system

229
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,180
secured but we found later that really

230
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,219
exploitable right her plea was the the

231
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,469
problem with the biggest example of this

232
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,539
one and it was exploitable for years

233
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:58,180
potentially before we even learned about

234
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,860
it and her plea was really bad no doubt

235
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,840
the idea that someone could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just snap</font>

236
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,699
your private key off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server you'd</font>

237
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,349
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know about it the joke I make</font>

238
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,789
when this one is I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

239
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,060
centers anymore I'm in the cloud like

240
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:12,729
where do i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cry the next one was</font>

241
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,349
the bash bug shell-shocked a remote code

242
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:15,430
execution through bash I mean these were

243
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,349
days when I'm just thinking you know

244
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">what computers we've had a good run I'm</font>

245
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open a meatball shop it's gonna</font>

246
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,159
be great so what about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

247
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,120
vulnerabilities with curl you know it's

248
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,400
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we actually</font>

249
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't use bash or curl to install</font>

250
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,198
software because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font>

251
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,729
crazy so for those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> I gave this</font>

252
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:35,049
talk at a conference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a bunch</font>

253
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,089
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows people had no idea what I was</font>

254
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,289
talking about with pearl bash but for

255
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,390
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that don't know there is</font>

256
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">this strange prevalence to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

257
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,360
easy to install software it involves

258
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,279
just downloading the script on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

259
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,750
internet and running it sometimes with

260
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,260
sudo sometimes if not doesn't really

261
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,149
matter either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and so I'm not going</font>

262
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,680
to hate on the colonel bash and I think

263
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there reasons why it exists</font>

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,670
but I have some issues with it as you

265
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">should as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you're about to</font>

266
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,020
see I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with a lot of things</font>

267
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,640
really so for many years again I said

268
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,370
this before as an option person security

269
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,350
is

270
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,690
and an afterthought right I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

271
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,070
so many cognitive resources for my daily

272
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,600
activities and I've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

273
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,100
hydro startup so you're spending all

274
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">your time keeping the application</font>

275
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,220
running keeping the system's going

276
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,540
you're not only thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

277
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">security aspect right you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying</font>

278
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,920
to keep the lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to do</font>

279
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,279
the right things I use strong passwords

280
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,410
least privileged access look for

281
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,670
unauthorized access<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many systems but</font>

282
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it's a natural thought and</font>

283
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,180
security updates I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

284
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,460
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of companies that run</font>

285
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,810
into you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even know how</font>

286
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,250
they do their security updates and do

287
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,810
they update and you know how are they

288
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,360
testing those updates and again how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

289
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,069
times have some simple security patch

290
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,870
simple patch release included some

291
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,310
breaking product change the worst thing

292
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,160
I've ever seen is a database that will

293
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,839
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be named they had this vulnerability</font>

294
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,459
that was remotely exploitable but you

295
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,680
can only get it if you update it to the

296
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,210
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor release which is kind of</font>

297
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big deal for a database holding many</font>

298
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,920
terabytes of data so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

299
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,170
systems out there also<font color="#CCCCCC"> that take a</font>

300
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
really casual approach to security and I

301
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,300
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that we start</font>

302
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,670
recognizing that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of his new tools</font>

303
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,020
they do enable us to work better but

304
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,020
they also introducing a lot of attack

305
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,069
vectors you know think of I'm sure

306
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone in here can think of many</font>

307
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,700
databases off the top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their head that</font>

308
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,459
have completely unauthenticated curl

309
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,720
access to write pretty much not logged

310
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,040
you can just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you can drop your</font>

311
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,390
whole database and I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just</font>

312
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,069
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right that's not even a</font>

313
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,650
malicious activity that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just someone</font>

314
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,420
making a mistake right but this is where

315
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,279
risk assessment comes into play and it's

316
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,300
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something for the auditors this</font>

317
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,610
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're actually doing</font>

318
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,069
as systems builders operators and

319
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,630
application developers every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day</font>

320
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,700
because consider this scenario one of

321
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,740
your engineers comes and says we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

322
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,990
replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> postgres with you know new</font>

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,450
hipster<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB you're going to apply this</font>

324
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,040
formula which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically tell</font>

325
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,620
you that those developers are now going

326
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on call anytime new hipster DB has</font>

327
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,860
some issues but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you need to</font>

328
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">acknowledge though that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you</font>

329
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,150
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this dedicated security team</font>

330
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,380
which for a lot of companies they don't

331
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,240
this is again you can't pass the buck

332
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,709
just because it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

333
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
dedicated to focus on it doesn't mean

334
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's no one's job so maybe you or</font>

335
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,229
your security team if you are lucky

336
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,580
enough to have one are going to make

337
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">these same risk assessments when maybe</font>

338
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,390
you're choosing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do SAS service may be</font>

339
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,040
some sort of third-party logging tool

340
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to use or maybe some new</font>

341
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,959
internal

342
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,040
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a specific questions</font>

343
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,420
like you know what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data are we</font>

344
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,760
sending their you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if that</font>

345
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,010
system is compromised what happens if

346
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,569
that data gets out into the public how

347
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,160
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that data is the day I have</font>

348
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,630
any value<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all can you scrub before</font>

349
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,219
sending but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be</font>

350
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,660
an excuse to not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAS services</font>

351
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,970
because you should still be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

352
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,610
same questions when you're running new

353
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,720
services internally as well so you

354
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,840
understand the risk when you're looking

355
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a SAS service absolutely and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i only</font>

356
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,980
say when using staff services it's the

357
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,500
classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your availability but it's</font>

358
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,150
also on your security and security

359
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,100
availability performance these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

360
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,140
features these are the core pieces of

361
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,820
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're building so so</font>

362
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to dive in now this was you know</font>

363
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,630
kind of the the high you know level view

364
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,699
of some things but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually</font>

365
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,020
going to dive in specifically fairly

366
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,490
fast and furious and go a bunch of

367
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,530
things that I actually learned and a lot

368
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,360
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things I i always think myself</font>

369
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're so basic I don't even know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

370
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this stuff but then I challenge</font>

371
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and they're like wow like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

372
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,780
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even thinking that or never even</font>

373
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,189
knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> existence so I always feel</font>

374
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there are a few things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

375
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,800
learn from<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically from what I had to</font>

376
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn last year so it's 2015 when you</font>

377
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,829
talk about configuration management I

378
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,449
feel like it's a non start you have to

379
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,910
have something you could have bespoke

380
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,580
bash scripts I know been at etsy has you

381
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,469
know really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-crafted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crocheted shell</font>

382
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,910
scripts for their stuff but they also

383
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,720
you can use chef of it doesn't matter

384
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you use what's that so the</font>

385
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,910
beautiful thing about configuration

386
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,350
management is obviously your

387
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,420
infrastructure is now is code but if

388
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,460
it's as code it's testable which means

389
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,930
when new security updates come out you

390
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,610
can deploy those you can test them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

391
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,310
you can also move very quickly when the

392
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,050
inevitable next<font color="#CCCCCC"> openssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue comes out</font>

393
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,209
your ability to move quickly to update

394
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,439
those changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know could be make a</font>

395
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,200
big difference as a grand scheme of

396
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,910
things so in a previous company<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked</font>

397
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,010
with our security engineers with a tool

398
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,630
called Test Kitchen any anyone here have

399
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,760
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Test Kitchen before it's uh</font>

400
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,439
it's basically a test suite that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wraps</font>

401
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,360
on top of the tool called vagrant that

402
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,220
you can use to build systems and what it

403
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,200
can do is you can have let's say a chef

404
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,880
cookbook that defines the state of your

405
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
infrastructure and so what I did was I

406
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,850
went to our security engineers and I

407
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,740
said hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run this command you can</font>

408
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">build one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our base boxes which is a</font>

409
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,130
box<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

410
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,600
configurations for stuff and they

411
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,590
started going through that and creating

412
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,480
audit rules and making changes

413
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,160
and once they started learning about how

414
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,570
we were building systems then they

415
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,400
started to build their security

416
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,410
monitoring on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and they were</font>

417
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,959
shipping configuration management code

418
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,130
for audit d 40 sec for various

419
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,990
application stuff that they wanted to

420
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,070
monitor and then auditing they started

421
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,560
creating tools that can audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,580
systems you know on the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the most</font>

423
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,859
important thing is that they started

424
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploying these application changes in</font>

425
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,010
the exact same pipeline we were using

426
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,680
for application development and for

427
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,970
systems development so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

428
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,709
about bug bounties real quick I think

429
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,410
it's amazing that a company like United

430
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:05,080
and any<font color="#E5E5E5"> United employees here no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

431
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,180
good so I I don't fly united for very

specific reasons but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was</font>

433
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,920
really a game changer when when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

434
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,540
would say a company like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> says hey</font>

435
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,979
we have a bug logic program here's how

436
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,410
you contact it you know there are

437
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,970
companies that can help you with this

438
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,800
even if you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific bug</font>

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,550
bounty program have a place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your site</font>

440
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,930
that people can go and report issues to

441
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,670
give them a way to contact you securely

442
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,280
and sadly you'll probably end up using

443
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,650
PGP for this we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk more about new</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeep you later so shared secrets is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard problem I think this is one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the hardest problems when we talk about</font>

447
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,230
I have this application and I need to

448
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,300
talk to database where do I store those

449
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,650
secrets and not only is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

450
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,849
when sharing secrets between maybe two

451
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,680
engineers working with each other it's

452
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,900
obviously very difficult in the systems

453
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,040
world but the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice I can give on</font>

454
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,510
this one is just don't put this one off

455
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,250
for another day and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

456
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very complex solution for this</font>

457
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,480
one I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords storing like</font>

458
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,949
wiki documents that was bad you don't

459
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,570
want to do that maybe you want to grab

460
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,800
like one password and have a shared

461
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,630
vault that you can share with people or

462
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,920
LastPass or something like that but no

463

<font color="#E5E5E5">matter what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to say make</font>

sure it's open<font color="#CCCCCC"> source crypto if it's not</font>

465
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,839
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of a big question mark</font>

466
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,579
but we need to stop with passwords and

467
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">wikis committing your secrets to github</font>

468
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,690
there was a blog post recently about a

469
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,100
developer who spent in an ordinate long

470
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,340
amount of time basically saying how this

471
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,810
bug in his visual studio caused him like

472
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">an eight thousand dollar amazon bill</font>

473
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,650
because you know he committed to a

474
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,230
private repo but there was a bug and it

475
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,819
made the repo public on github well it

476
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,560
wasn't so much that there was a bug in

477
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,990
his editor there actually was but the

478
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,180
fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was committing at a WS root</font>

479
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,130
access keys into source control there

480
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,560
are scanners on github the second you

481
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,689
put it on there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with it</font>

482
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,709
minutes you'll see people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it so so</font>

483
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,300
we need to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better place for these</font>

lot of these do not just a couple of

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,770
quick notes vault project is a from a

491

company called hachey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corp they've</font>

492
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,250
created a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems</font>

493
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:05,790

494
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,320
and supports easy to set up there is a

495
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,910
tool called Red October by cloudflare

496
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,860
this came out maybe a year or two ago

497
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,150
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting way to store</font>

498
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,650
high-value secrets where it requires

499
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,300
multiple people's keys in order to

500
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,980
decrypt the secret so if you have really

501
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,430
high value like ssl keys or something

502
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,130
and then jazz this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tool that allows</font>

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,689
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share secrets using ssh keys we</font>

use this at threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech all the time</font>

505
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,550
because everyone has an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssh key to log</font>

506
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">in to the system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have our bastion</font>

does anyone know what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a picture</font>

511
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:44,220
of these are literally the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only security</font>

512
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:46,650
is that that webcam has no public IP

513
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,570
address but what you're looking at our

514
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,040
two-factor tokens in a data center with

515
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,240
a webcam so that people don't actually

516
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to hold onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's kind of</font>

517
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,500
defeats the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor but let's</font>

518
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,790
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you factor right so everyone</font>

519
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,560
in their pocket likely has a two-factor

00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,849
device on them right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you have you</font>

523
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,400
security they do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay me to show for</font>

524
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,139
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show just for free</font>

525
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,850
because it's such an amazing tool if

526
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,860
you're not using to factor in your

527
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,020

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,670
whatever there's also as an amusing to

530
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,490
you Bee Gees there's these little tokens

531

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-time password generation</font>

532
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,209
websites are now getting support for the

533
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,490
you know unified two-factor

534
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,170
authentication programs so you can have

535
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate to factor the log into things</font>

without typing you know five<font color="#E5E5E5"> digit six</font>

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your company duo is a couple</font>

password generation stuff those are

541
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,409
twenty dollars or something like that so

542
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours is all in i</font>

543
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,809
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at night knowing that</font>

544
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,110
everyone might

545
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:48,928
but he has you know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up so email</font>

546
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,979
encryption is still a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

547
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:55,409
painful and email is just one part of

548
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,240
company communication you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have</font>

the slack channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> right for last con</font>

people might be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> HipChat or IRC you</font>

552
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:05,279
you know how big<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your company and</font>

553
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,350
could people snip that traffic is it ssl

554
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,519
who really knows right so the only look

555
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,110
when I ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about kind of</font>

556
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,470

557
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,668
I say is just don't trust it right

558
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,710
mistakes happen people drop sensitive

559
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,659
data and chat but I always flip this

560
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,269
over to how quickly could you roll

561
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:24,360
credentials for your whole company for

562
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,700
for critical systems I can remember many

563
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,439
situations where the first engineer at

564
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the company has been there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for many many</font>

565
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,470
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then suddenly he's not there</font>

566
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,240
anymore and someone comes to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

567
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,249
hey Pete I need you to roll all the

568
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials that Bob had access to it's</font>

569
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,039
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know that's pretty much</font>

570
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,029
everything in this comment right so how

571
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:41,039
quickly can you roll those credentials

572
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,119
have you tested that you should test

573
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,200
that like you should be testing your

574
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:49,408
backgrounds so something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did at threat</font>

575
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,629
stack was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to cross a enforced</font>

576
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:53,789
PGP well I was forcing everyone to use

577
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:55,230
PGP because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it so that</font>

578
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone had it set up and ready to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

579
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,059
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> email so what I did is I actually to</font>

580
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,009
basically a force everyone in is I set

581
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:03,389
up our vp observers and we had set up

582
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:05,580
scripts that would basically create your

583
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:08,789
VPN bundle and then encrypt it with your

584
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,740
pgp key so they didn't have to have PGP

585
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:13,230
but if they didn't they couldn't

586
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,539
actually log into anything so the best

587
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,509
way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to use bgp is to force</font>

588
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,269
them to use bgp any be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got so</font>

589
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:23,700
much so much over this one people

590
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:24,960
complained and complained and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

591
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,669
have just ripped<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out in a heartbeat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

592
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,889
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have but we took our time</font>

593
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:30,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">we iterated and we approved the user</font>

594
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience to the point where our</font>

595
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,220
salespeople have PGP our CEO does like

596
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,498
every single person has it there's a

597
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,139
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit up front yo cost but then it</font>

598
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:41,879
does pay for itself later so let's talk

599
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,918
about packaging this is actually a

600
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:46,949
picture of me trying to build a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Debian</font>

601
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">package so a lot of people I go away</font>

602
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,700
twice packaging a security issue and

603
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:52,289
it's mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prevalence of how we are</font>

604
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,580
seeing software being installed today

605
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,408
just curl the script down from github

606
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,519
just clone this<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapport whatever you</font>

607
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:59,019
know everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to have this one</font>

608
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,760
line installer to make it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and</font>

609
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I understand why it exists we have this</font>

610
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,690
thing called time<font color="#E5E5E5"> value so if you have a</font>

611
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,070
product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your site is sells someone</font>

612
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,210
the quicker they think you get up and

613
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">running with your application your</font>

614
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:10,570
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get value out of it the more</font>

615
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely they are to buy it that's why</font>

616
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,220
that thing exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going through some</font>

617
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,559
like 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> step setup document to start</font>

618
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,840
using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> application it's highly</font>

619
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,480
likely that by step 5 they're gone and

620
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,789
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go try something else</font>

621
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,799
so curl bash is not the worst thing ever

622
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,299
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it and I don't recommend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

623
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,889
but honestly if you go to threats deck

624
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:31,210
we have a pearl batch because people

625
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:33,539
have asked for it legitimately enough

626
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,100
and so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually recommend is is</font>

627
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,720
grab that script and just take a peek

628
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,789
and what you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours does is it sets</font>

629
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,799
up a repo and it sets up the keys and

630
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:44,769
then it apt-get or young installs the

631
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,539
whatever because what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ensure</font>

632
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,549
is that that game is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not changing behind</font>

633
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,169
you right and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these</font>

634
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,720
signatures the nice thing is with

635
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:54,429
packaging is that sometimes it works and

636
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,409
sometimes it works great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then other</font>

637
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">times things get tricky so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

638
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,549
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ran into last year where I</font>

639
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,080
was building packages Debian packages

640
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">rpm packages to work on you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

641
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,789
different linux systems and you know did

642
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,470
a lot of reading about PGP and kind of

643
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consensus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was you create you know</font>

644
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,639
pgp key then you go up subkeys and you

645
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,529
sign your package<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read a lot</font>

646
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know articles about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

647
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:17,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty much whatever incensed I</font>

648
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,399
said great i like again security might

649
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,559
an individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to give that a</font>

650
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:22,059
shot so i worked with you know Debian

651
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,799
packages sign them everything was fine

652
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpms it didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work I</font>

653
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,519
got a very cryptic error so i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

654
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:29,320
google and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i searched on this cryptic</font>

655
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,090
air and there were like four results so

656
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,220
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like no one's ever done</font>

657
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,500
this before right so I find this

658
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:38,139
blogthis this blog post any pride<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

659
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,880
see the date it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> November 29th of 2006</font>

660
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:42,610
this is actually the person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

661
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,529
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpm the actual rpm tool at</font>

662
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,120
Red Hat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what he says is for what</font>

663
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,889
it's worth I have most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sub P into</font>

664
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,750
implementation done but that still won't

665
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,519
solve your problem as it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be years</font>

666
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,220
before the implementations widely

667
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,899
deployed so we're going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years I'm</font>

668
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,260
feeling good anyone work at Red Hat here

669
00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:00,908
no one I'm still try like a bottle of

670
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,570
scotch if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship this thing out there</font>

671
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:07,040
like whatever needs to get it done so so

672
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,570
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about packaging and when</font>

673
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,860
just kind of randomly download scripts

674
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,570
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this also</font>

675
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,939
internally as well I see where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

676
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh just clone the repo and compile</font>

677
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,630
that code on the server and there there

678
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">are many reasons why that's wrong and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

679
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,510
can I could spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time talking</font>

680
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them find me later when I'm when</font>

681
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,840
I'm drinking it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably share</font>

682
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,250
that with you but one thing I do

683
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,659
recommend is this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a</font>

684
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,640
process that we follow internally when

685
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,230
we build our packages we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> our source</font>

686
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,580
you compile it you know there's testing

687
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,110
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with this as well we</font>

688
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,760
build our package of them assignment and

689
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,020
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we test those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signed packages and</font>

690
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,090
then we can ensure that that package

691
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,670
integrity maintains throughout the whole

692
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,800
pipeline after that and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

693
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,910
say oh like I hate curl bash and it's

694
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,470
like well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deploy your codes</font>

695
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,150
like well we cloned from github it's

696
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,650
like no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no like you can't do you</font>

697
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,840
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay with the</font>

698
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,430
other and the nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is that</font>

699
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,620
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a bunch of tools that can help</font>

700
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,030
you with this so you might notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

701
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,770
this talk is maybe a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

702
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,270
slanted on like the debian ubuntu a

703
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,970
world that's just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world that</font>

704
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,590
I've been living in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's if you're on</font>

705
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,050
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Red Hat you can create a</font>

706
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,389
khajuri paws very very easily with one

707
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,430
tool that just works the debian<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

708
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,130
have like 18 versions of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool that</font>

709
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,050
all work in a very different way but

710
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,370
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few things that I've used</font>

711
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally once called aptly which is a</font>

712
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,689
newer tool to make repo creation easier

713
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,470
distinct dead s3 allows you to create

714
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,600
debian repos on s3 on the cheap really

715
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,070
nice and then there's a tool called

716
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,840
package cloud this is actually a company

717
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,210
and they're trying to make packaging

718
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,649
delivery easier if you have an open

719
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">source project you can host it with them</font>

720
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,930
for free so you can get your customers

721
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,460
and your users of your project

722
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,040
downloading packages from them sign

723
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,400
packages which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is better</font>

724
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,680
than you know randomly curling stuff so

725
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,800
so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about ssl certificate so</font>

726
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,570
when real avocado facts com has an ssl

727
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,850
certificate you should have an ssl

728
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,620
certificate we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Google</font>

729
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,199
gives you higher search result if you

730
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,729
are ssl but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say you should have real</font>

731
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,500
sorts as well I've seen companies say

732
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,210
well we have an internal CA it's cheaper

733
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,440
that way whatever it's like okay well

734
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,300
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how do you get the ca search</font>

735
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,160
well we just tell people to click<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

736
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,710
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine it's ours you're defeating the</font>

737
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,360
point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL just by a real certificate</font>

738
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,860
it doesn't cost that much the cost is so

739
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,899
low and now with the let's encrypt

740
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,159
project this is like a no-brainer when

741
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,020
they start doling out certificates for

742
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,260
people it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like time to</font>

743
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,290
start

744
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated people i think but take the</font>

745
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,170
time to set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly and not to say</font>

746
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,780
it's easy right we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

747
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,460
decades of technical debt so pop quiz

748
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,649
anyone know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl default</font>

750
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,610
some other goddamn place you are

751
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,110
probably right because there is no

752
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that anyone there's no incentive</font>

753
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,290
for people to improve these systems and

754
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,790
I think that's the sad thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

755
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,950
should improve a lot of the user

756
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:49,310
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> around how we build and how</font>

757
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,750
we test and how we secure systems but

758
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,700
don't just set them up as well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

759
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,920
tell people you know monitor them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

760
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,480
well because and let let they would have

761
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,480
not let a certificate expired cast the

762
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,860
first stone right but gmail com

763
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate expired that that was</font>

764
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,030
actually issue and with their with their

765
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,800
intermediate CA Instagram certificate

766
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,110
expired I actually had three other

767
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,750
slides of other issues where the

768
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,639
Microsoft cloud went down like four

769
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,020
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their cert expired and</font>

770
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,000
then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened again two years later</font>

771
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,889
and everyone's like how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how come</font>

772
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,060
there sir expire after two years again

773
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,980
how can they let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happen again and</font>

774
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,649
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious isn't it someone bought it</font>

775
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">four years ago and then forgot about it</font>

776
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,570
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and now it expired and</font>

777
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,709
knowing no one knew it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so call</font>

778
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,330
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might either be</font>

779
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,880
here or be a sponsor I don't know but

780
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,590
anyone use the ssl labs testing site if

781
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,750
you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this you should</font>

782
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,209
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it it's an amazing service</font>

783
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,340
this was so helpful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

784
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,260
say an ssl newbie to figure out if my

785
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,790
application was secure in any sort of

786
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,870
way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only that if they'll tell</font>

787
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,820
you you know they've essentially

788
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,679
gamified web security right like do you

789
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how badly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to get 100 in</font>

790
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,420
every column<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it kills me that</font>

791
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,060
that's at a 90 right but it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> A+ it's</font>

792
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,830
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> A+ that's fun right um I actually did</font>

793
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,260
spend the time more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

794
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,760
admit getting to 100 and it turns out

795
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,010
there's only like three browsers on the

796
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,020
planet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can that can view your</font>

797
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,300
content when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your trick</font>

798
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,120
so there's a balance right you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

799
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,940
balance it out what's really great about

800
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the lab site if they have an</font>

801
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,170
API so so we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool called sensu</font>

802
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,760
it's for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> host based monitoring since</font>

803
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,290
you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> will check you know whatever</font>

804
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,300
scripted run so we just created some

805
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,610
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ruby scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that contact the site</font>

806
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,490
they test our public facing ssl

807
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,020
certificates once a day because

808
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,910
they constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates like when some</font>

809
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,740
new vulnerability comes out and it drops

810
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> B because you don't have whatever</font>

811
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,429
or you're writing an older version we

812
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,750
get notified right away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font>

813
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:46,900
been incredibly helpful for us so um any

814
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,080
any users of audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> d.o sec here raising</font>

816
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands go down right so so these two</font>

817
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,980
tools for those of you that don't know

818
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,870
so oddity is the user space component of

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux audit system essentially lets</font>

would spend more time on improving it

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,429
because if the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience isn't</font>

833
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,690
good for an operator if they're

turn off selinux it's like well that

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh SEC audit d and even if you do</font>

absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duncan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this data if you</font>

you can start generating graph so this

these changes of things that are

853
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,470
happening so even if you don't alert on

854
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,790
it you just save this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start</font>

855
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting some pretty valuable insights</font>

856
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can also use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial tools so if</font>

857
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,610
your company you know had has<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk if</font>

858
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,980
you're if you're lucky enough to be able

859
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,709
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford it you know you can use splunk</font>

860
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,000
and you can do the exact same thing and

861
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,309
your continuous security monitoring it

862
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,490
shouldn't have to stop at your host if

863
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:26,590
you're on amazon they have cloud service

864
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,240
it's a free service it generates all the

865
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">API calls of everything that's happening</font>

866
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,200
so as you start kind of moving into this

867
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,600
dev ops base and giving people broader

868
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,040
access to systems you know you could

869
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,570
basically monitor for what they're doing

870
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,010
so I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> alerts we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feed</font>

871
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,689
this stuff than you are into our

872
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,500
application and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts set up</font>

873
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,120
that say if a run instances<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

874
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,320
it's not inside of an auto scale group

875
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,580
than I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an alert because</font>

876
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,580
that's a scenario that shouldn't happen

877
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,169
for us so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

878
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,240
high-tech solutions to these problems I

879
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,680
did talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of the specific kind</font>

880
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,420
of technology things kind of the more

881
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,010
you know how to wash your hands idea of

882
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,050
security and a lot of that stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

883
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,910
I learned but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have an incident</font>

884
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,490
response plan in place what happens if

885
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:07,310
you lost your laptop your conference do

886
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,590
you know who to call don't discount the

887
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:11,210
benefit of training teaching and most

888
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,980
importantly a blameless security post

889
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,530
mortems so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this applies kind of</font>

890
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,720
company wide because if employees are

891
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,310
afraid to come to you and tell you that

892
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,460
oh I click this<font color="#E5E5E5"> link and it was it was</font>

893
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know did something odd or I went to</font>

894
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,310
this website and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> added something was</font>

895
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:26,390
strange if they're afraid to come to you

896
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,610
and essentially tell you these things

897
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,960
because they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get blamed or</font>

898
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,370
yelled at they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna stop coming</font>

899
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like the bad</font>

900
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,750
things are not going to happen they're

901
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,419
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you what it does</font>

902
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,040
so have a policy just a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

903
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,080
for different parts of your business

904
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,790
right keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

905
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,179
need you know an ITIL instant response

906
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,950
plan maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet so something that I</font>

907
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,620
like to do in like a lost laptop

908
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,970
scenario is we use paint your duty it's

909
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,070
a way to alert people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of based on a</font>

910
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,990
schedule and so if someone loses<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

911
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,399
laptop I've told everyone like if I got

912
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,410
a call at two a.m. on a saturday because

913
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop that's totally</font>

914
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine like I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that call every day</font>

915
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,270
of the week but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you roll in the</font>

916
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,100
office is like eight o'clock on monday

917
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,629
and i lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> my laptop at the bar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

918
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,679
friday like can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you help me out like</font>

919
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will be a much different</font>

920
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,390
conversation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i try to make myself</font>

921
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,530
available as many hours as i can and we

922
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,710
have it rotating through a bunch of

923
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:21,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">people but having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something is better</font>

924
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,480
than having<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing because interesting</font>

925
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,000
things happen right engineering might

926
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,470
see things that look a little odd maybe

927
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,690
they drop it in the chat room say hey

928
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:31,340
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is strange you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

929
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:34,040
cross-site scripting inside of an ssl

930
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:36,320
cert maybe they see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nike connection</font>

931
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,940
from an unknown source maybe they see a

932
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,260
database dump on a server that's

933
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually one of the most likely ones</font>

934
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,800
like well wait a second we don't back up

935
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,110
our databases that way why is there a

936
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,250
database dump here because again you

937
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,889
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember there's always going to</font>

938
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,540
be unusual attack vectors so if you are

939
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,640
doing you know doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps right</font>

940
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,240
you're giving access to a broader group

941
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,680
of people

942
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,330
this is a frightening reality to a lot

943
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,710
of companies they used to be able to

944
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,480
lock you out right if you were a

945
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,040
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or an application builder you</font>

946
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,200
were you're essentially locked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

947
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,600
operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that platform we know now that</font>

948
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,520
engineers build better systems when

949
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,850
they're responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the help of</font>

950
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,440
those applications and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when we talk</font>

951
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">about giving safe access we essentially</font>

952
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,400
mean monitor everything it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> class</font>

953
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">of trust but verify there's a great</font>

954
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,140
quote from<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark burgess he's the creator</font>

955
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,090
of CF engine kind of believed to be kind

956
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,770
of the the origin of a configuration

957
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,300
management he says every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

958
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,860
logs into a system interactively they

959
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,100
compromise everyone's knowledge of that

960
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,479
system I think this not only applies to

961
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,969
operators making different changes to

962
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,290
the system but it also applies to really

963
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,610
anything that's happened down there I

964
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,170
mean my greatest fear I have as

965
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,240
engineers who are logging in while on

966
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,490
call they get an alert it's maybe like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

967
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a.m. maybe they install a package to fix</font>

968
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,280
an issue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get around it they're going</font>

969
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,150
to go back the next day and maybe they

970
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,889
were good maybe they're you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

971
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:53,450
gonna look at this difficult issue is

972
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,250
they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know hot passion on</font>

973
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,830
the fly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're pulling in</font>

974
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:59,660
dependencies of that code or the

975
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,790
transitive dependencies which are much

976
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,710
harder to track now you have a system

977
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,210
state that you cannot verify and it's

978
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,230
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bed and</font>

979
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,130
maybe they're going to completely forget

980
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:11,450
about it so it's trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> with verify and</font>

981
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,860
we give a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust for our engineers</font>

982
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threads down we really try to give</font>

983
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,990
people if they're building the

984
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,290
application you're on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

985
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,970
application and we are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

986
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,379
lucky we get to use dressed act monitor

987
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,690
press deck so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see things when</font>

988
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,250
engine when like a new process starts I

989
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,630
can see a new service start I can see

990
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,580
this new connection got open we can

991
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">verify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people aren't like SCP and</font>

992
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,429
files around you know I've seen that

993
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">before in our dev environment looks like</font>

994
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,880
hey you know I see us you feed this file

995
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,530
you know the server like why aren't you

996
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">using our continuous you know deployment</font>

997
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,590
pipeline and I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a training</font>

998
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,629
option it's not to go up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them be like</font>

999
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,340
hey I saw what you did although my CEO

1000
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,630
trolls me all the time where I was on a

1001
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,820
server one time when I was fixing an

1002
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,560
issue and I type my password then wrong

1003
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,149
you know for sudo and whoops okay try it

1004
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,919
again they're wrong again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I finally</font>

1005
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">got it right and he gets an alert for</font>

1006
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,330
that you know invalid password attempts

1007
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,190
and so he hits me up on chat says you

1008
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">type your password and wrong and the</font>

1009
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,230
server I was like yeah yeah twice really

1010
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,900
like dude I got a new keyboard like just

1011
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,400
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some time right so you know so</font>

1012
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,620
the things that in that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1013
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,970
hilarious situation you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1014
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,469
same scenario it's like he really wanted

1015
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out because he knew that that's</font>

1016
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,980
odd for me it's odd to me to type my

1017
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,770
password wrong so many times right so is

1018
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,790
that something else happening down there

1019
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,889
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of open source tools</font>

1020
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,629
like I said audit do sec that you can

1021
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> type this these events out to a log</font>

1022
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can monitor what your users are</font>

1023
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,540
doing my joke there is open source is

1024
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,370
only free if your time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth nothing</font>

1025
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,980
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a human cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1026
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,270
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and that's fine like you</font>

1027
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,740
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> use open source and we should</font>

1028
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,810
definitely improve a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools</font>

1029
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,010
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a small company and you</font>

1030
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,330
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you can absolutely</font>

1031
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,560
buy your way out of these problems

1032
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,199
there's a lot of great tools out there

1033
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,000
to help you so continuous security

1034
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,770
monitoring is more important that we

1035
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,350
treat our servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like cattle instead of</font>

1036
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:53,480
pets having security visibility through

1037
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,550
monitoring is I would say as just

1038
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,070
important as centralizing all your

1039
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,210
application logs as taking all your host

1040
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,220
based metrics and getting them to a

1041
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,750
central place I was at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> am WS</font>

1042
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,600
reinvent conference and there was a talk

1043
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,410
with Steve Schmidt and the person I

1044
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,418
can't remember who's the head of

1045
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,980
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the amazon.com and they</font>

1046
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:11,750
were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how they stay secure</font>

1047
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,060
in the cloud because they're literally

1048
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,850
moving amazoncom to Amazon Web Services

1049
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,440
and so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do this they</font>

1050
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,639
say logging their login everything

1051
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,899
everything that's happening is gets

1052
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,429
logged and he says well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you want</font>

1053
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,529
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing more of I want to be logging</font>

1054
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,000
more things he didn't say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1055
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,200
well we're creating this awesome like

1056
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,880
alerting whatever it's like they're just

1057
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,699
capturing this data because they can do

1058
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduced up with that later so start</font>

1059
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,449
small you don't have to boil the ocean

1060
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,710
and it could seem super overwhelming if

1061
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,060
you're entered into a situation and

1062
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to figure out I need to</font>

1063
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,630
secure everything out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like you</font>

1064
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,720
do but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it overnight</font>

1065
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,040
I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after your high-risk targets go</font>

1066
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,408
after your anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> public-facing go</font>

1067
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,179
after your VPN systems if you work today

1068
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,800
to instrument some sort of monitoring

1069
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:53,030
security monitoring into your systems

1070
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,770
the same way that you would monitor the

1071
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,730
health of your application I think it

1072
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,220
sets you up to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

1073
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ultimate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I always</font>

1074
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,419
like to talk about is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

1075
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,490
technical problem when we're trying to

1076
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,350
get security teams and develop routines

1077
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,089
and operations teams and really sales

1078
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,069
teams and everyone else together it's a

1079
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,230
people problem being the security

1080
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,060
asshole it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work anymore I</font>

1081
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,920
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of empathy goes a long way</font>

1082
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,119
and that goes on both sides you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1083
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowing that the security team means</font>

1084
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,390
to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass audits and</font>

1085
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:24,539
we have these pci systems that exist

1086
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,190
there for a reason and so having empathy

1087
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,009
for those people as well as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1088
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,630
side it's definitely a two-way street so

1089
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:32,190
I message to all the info SEC teams out

1090
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:35,160
there that are wary of kind of the

1091
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:37,200
DevOps community is welcoming with open

1092
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,490
arms you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that like said</font>

1093
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,538
this is my first security conference

1094
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,129
I've given this talk of DevOps

1095
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:42,480
conferences and people are like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1096
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,069
security I really should<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing</font>

1097
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">something with that but what I'd love to</font>

1098
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:47,819
see is more security content making its

1099
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,920
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those types of conferences to</font>

1100
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:51,720
developer an application<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Opera</font>

1101
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,160
operators conferences the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high velocity</font>

1102
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,230
whatever you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are things that</font>

1103
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to help improve how we all</font>

1104
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,049
work because honestly it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1105
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,328
people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this it's</font>

1106
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:02,190
honestly they just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've</font>

1107
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,029
talked with operators that you know hey

1108
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,380
what are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1109
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:06,390
know more about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the secure</font>

1110
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,950
system like why I just don't know like

1111
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,038
they just don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to answer</font>

1112
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,689
it so this is learning all around the

1113
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,430
just remember though the best security

1114
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,319
cultures are collaborative though

1115
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,240
they're not prescriptive we all

1116
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,308
understand business has to get done but

1117
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,240
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to drive progress with</font>

1118
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:24,180
fear I think you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

1119
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,470
yourself on a losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle I don't</font>

1120
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's going to be getting easier</font>

1121
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:30,238
right fridges are giving out your

1122
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,640
personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> data they're sending spam and</font>

1123
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,130
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> massive botnet attacks they might</font>

1124
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">even link your gmail credentials I don't</font>

1125
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,989
know who's making these<font color="#E5E5E5"> fridges but they</font>

1126
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:41,578
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop the cool thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font>

1127
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,920
have a much greater<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness of</font>

1128
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,809
security everyone is talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1129
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,220
mean both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my parents you know they</font>

1130
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:49,349
worked in factories they are the

1131
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,118
probably least two technical people that

1132
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,039
I know of and they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out</font>

1133
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,660
there understanding that there are

1134
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,039
security risks and the number of times

1135
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,989
they've had to change their credit card

1136
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,249
because it's been stolen and the great

1137
00:36:57,989 --> 00:37:00,480
news like I said is what we're talking

1138
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:02,669
about it with the Internet of Things

1139
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,690
again it's gonna get harder and I don't

1140
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">even call it the Internet of Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1141

called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of vulnerable</font>

1142
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,279
refrigerators because as we just learned

1143
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,660
clearly it's those that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> killing it</font>

1144
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:11,609

<font color="#E5E5E5">where I had like five slides in all of</font>

1149
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,239
things that we're putting these trips in

1150
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:22,170
