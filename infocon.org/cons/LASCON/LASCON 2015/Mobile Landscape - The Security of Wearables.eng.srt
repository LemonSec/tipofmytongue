00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,340
no thanks for joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> me today to talk</font>

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,529
about mobile landscape security of

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,229
wearables I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth on</font>

6
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:34,480
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> landscape because is an IOT is it</font>

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,578
mobile I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know that's</font>

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,898
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be more defined probably over</font>

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:44,019
the next few years who's going to define

10
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:46,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but so my agenda today</font>

11
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:47,440
a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level but before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i get</font>

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,430
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like to have a feel for</font>

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience so developers here testers</font>

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:00,879
a couple managers anything else just

15
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,799
cured it for the beer cool anyone really

16
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,140
working on wearables or creating them

17
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,320
software for them consuming data from

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,000
wearables<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,770
going to change for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font>

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,350
development especially in the upcoming

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:16,449
years as we started planting things into

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,699
people and so on but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what wearables are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,850
landscape of them trying to address some

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:28,270
of the you know high level issues in

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,000
kind of the future a little bit about me

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,500
I've been around for a while I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,420
mobile practice quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,450
just recently switched over to a vis IAM

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,970
to grow even more and we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

31
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,180
get into more Internet of Things and

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:48,009
obviously wearables as well so what are

33
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">they well you can argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

34
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined very well but basically</font>

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:55,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you wear right I mean it could</font>

36
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:58,299
be my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple watch it could be you see</font>

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there the GoPro fitbit's</font>

38
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,720
what have you you know they're

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,500
monitoring everything from health data

40
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:08,830
to you know heart rate information

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,810
telling you when you step<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand</font>

42
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,790
times what have you but they're getting

43
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">more powerful right I'm now able to run</font>

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,900
apps on my Apple

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,609
which is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary I can purchase</font>

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,780
stuff with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's credit</font>

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,239
card info there's a lot of sensitive

48
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,069
stuff on this right and that's only

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to increase you know computers are</font>

50
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,190
getting faster and faster anyone have an

51
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,630
idea when the first wearable was created

52
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:37,209
come on don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shy I know it's kind of</font>

53
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,980
really would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you believe is 1961 right</font>

54
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,980
nineteen sixty one thing about computers

55
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,079
were the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room right and to</font>

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,780
MIT professors to math professors

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,819
actually created this wearable it's not

58
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,340
real pretty as you can see but it's

59
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,958
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> two pieces to that they'd strap</font>

60
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,250
it on their back or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

61
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,380
there was also something in their shoe

62
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:01,360
any idea what it did for them it was

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,069
roulette right it helped them beat

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,810
roulette right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

65
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,700
mathematicians they have all these math

66
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,040
things so wearables have really been

67
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,349
around right unfortunately computers

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,750
were so large it didn't really make

69
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:16,238
sense then but now we're running

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">computers on our wrists right and</font>

71
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,739
everywhere else now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

72
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">little under estimate but by 2019 more</font>

73
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,690
than half a billion wearable devices

74
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,489
will be in use every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> day you know</font>

75
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,010
whatever that wearable might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

76
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,260
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the future coming up</font>

77
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,269
with that many devices in use and all

78
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,370
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and connections and</font>

79
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth and what have you there's</font>

80
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,660
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of areas of concern from</font>

81
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security perspective especially</font>

82
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,769
depending on what that data might be you

83
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:53,769
know as API is it privacy concerns

84
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:55,600
things like that so today right are they

85
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">security relevant I'd say yes I mean</font>

86
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,459
we're looking at things such as health

87
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,069
biometric data you know steps heart rate

88
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,810
workout information insulin levels you

89
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,458
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got things that track our</font>

90
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,920
insulin you know insulin pumps and so on

91
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,660
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see more things from a</font>

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,608
travel reservation standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

93
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,989
of us who who travel you know

consultants we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the freaking</font>

country

96
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,350
whatever else they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to allow</font>

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">hotel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keys and so on VPS data little</font>

100
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,190
scary actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to track</font>

101
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,340
someone but so a couple real world

102
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:42,910
examples anyone heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> strava anyone</font>

103
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:46,780
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay scary right so strava is one</font>

104
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,750
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> billion apps that allow you to</font>

track your activity right mostly

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,340
cyclists and runners<font color="#E5E5E5"> use strava allows</font>

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,680
them to compete against everyone in the

what they call king of the mountain

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,220
that's the little crown there if they do

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,980
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else or what have</font>

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,380
you the interesting thing here is all of

113
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that data is then immediately strained</font>

114
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,080
up to some cloud service online it's

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,440
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free to anyone right</font>

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,090
anyone can go see this you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

117
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a real small example but this is</font>

118
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,539
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all this data you</font>

119
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,340
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of what it looks like</font>

120
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,340
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just went out there yesterday</font>

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,080
actually and that's right out now right

long it took them where they ran bike

126
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,969
whatever they did and actually I've got

127
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to post a youtube video so when you've</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are more of a concern you know</font>

136
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,270
if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a specific person</font>

and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're using this sort of</font>

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,330
map that's already there it already

144
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:26,800
tells me where they've been hilton

145
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,560
anyone i'm a hilton guy so hilton now

146
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,930
has with

147
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">digital keys they've actually</font>

148
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,720
implemented it in probably 15 or 20 of

149
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,870
their hotels across the country allows

150
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,330
you to download the key to your iphone

151
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,060
bluetooth put it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the door let you</font>

152
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,400
in right sounds awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to me it</font>

153
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,440
sounds scary as well I mean you know is

154
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,409
it scarier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little keys they</font>

155
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,940
have before I don't know maybe maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

156
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if someone can figure it out it</font>

157
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,710
might more<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily allow them to get into</font>

158
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,200
other rooms right pretty easily so

159
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're rolling that out and that's only</font>

160
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> increase over time whether it's</font>

161
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,639
in your phone or in some implanted

162
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:12,860
device in the future who knows but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

163
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:18,490
definitely coming how about pacemakers

164
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:20,930
anyone have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thank the Lord right so</font>

165
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,850
pacemakers today are for the most part

166
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,650
connected you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're getting</font>

167
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:28,400
them from places like Medtronic and so

168
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,039
on they are only a published type of

169
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,080
device so they're only sending out data

170
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,890
so your doctor can view that in real

171
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,719
time now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens though when they</font>

172
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,349
start to want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjustments to</font>

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,520
them remotely now it's a pub sub allows

174
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,770
data in that's a little scary right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

175
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,750
if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with it today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

176
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it only use a cellular so it's</font>

177
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,090
secure you know if their problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,419
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publish you know you could see</font>

180
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,469
when Dick Cheney got one right like oh

181
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,539
this is scary you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could kill the</font>

182
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,810
vice president because he's got this

connected pacemaker and this medical

184
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,680

191
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,200
screwed a researcher released a few

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago but she talked about</font>

193
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday and she can hack Fitbit within</font>

194

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">utilizing some flaw that she found in</font>

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Bluetooth in the way her ex she can</font>

198
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,020
send data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that Fitbit which then</font>

199
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,330
actually streams that up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent</font>

200
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,459
device so depending when paired devices

201
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,470
she could potentially craft that

202
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:57,500
malicious payload which I think was like

203
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,740
17 bites what can you do a 17<font color="#CCCCCC"> bites i'm</font>

204
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,170
not sure but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> being said how many</font>

205
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">fitbit's are you seeing every single day</font>

206
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,839
right more than you probably know and

207
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:12,370
one account but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple things like</font>

208
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is attacking the Fitbit a big deal</font>

209
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,260
maybe maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the fact that that</font>

210
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:20,750
malicious payload propagates to that

211
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:25,939
parent device that's where I get a

212
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:28,459
little concerned so what security

213
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,300
hurdles so there's only a coupler 11 ish

214
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:33,680
working on actual wearables in here I

215
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,410
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are any different than</font>

216
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,660
what we're used to with web apps mobile

217
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,140
apps what have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> write typical</font>

218
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:46,130
development factors speed the market

219
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,140
it's fast fast fast or fast cost of

220
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,790
manufacturing you know the whole point

221
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,569
of a wearable is to have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

222
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:56,060
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even concealed but powerful</font>

223
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,860
enough to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> appealing to whoever's</font>

224
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,739
purchasing it you know for tracking

225
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,860
things or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and perceived</font>

226
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,900
security profile on the device if that

227
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,180
profile is seen as insecure and it's

228
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,880
storing things or saving information

229
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,010
that scene is private data or PII or

230
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,180
what have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know obviously someone</font>

231
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,530
might not purchase that and what is safe

232
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,089
I think the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing here with</font>

233
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,459
wearables is there's boundaries right

234
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,500
and we're crossing them whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

235
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,199
might be you know what can we do as

236
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,870
opposed to what we should do you know

237
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,780
connected pacemakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthsite type</font>

238
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,329
data devices that we can control

239
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">remotely that's scary to me you know if</font>

240
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,130
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about cyber threats and</font>

241
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,660
so on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if if someone creates a</font>

242
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,850
pacemaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allowing remote</font>

243
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:47,360

244
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,200
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US residents only that's</font>

245
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">scary</font>

246
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">me right I mean it might be fun but you</font>

247
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,160
know if some cyber terrorist gets ahold

248
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,930
of that information and finds a flaw

249
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,969
they could potentially kill off a bunch

250
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,089
of Americans right I mean sounds

251
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,010
interesting so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

252
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,930
front landscape a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

253
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,520
get i think is fairly similar to the

254
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile space which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why i called it</font>

255
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,030
the mobile landscape you know you're

256
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,110
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware social engineering data</font>

257
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:21,610
theft you know BYOD botnets what have

258
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:25,250
you but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what our attackers after</font>

259
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,430
they're looking for data for the most

260
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,940
part data they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell right data is</font>

261
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,819
expensive to buy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> its profitable for</font>

262
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,740
those that selling access right I might

263
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to access not necessarily to your</font>

264
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,820
wearable but whatever devices is

265
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,860
connecting to I might want that access

266
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,470
so i can monitor something else if I can

267
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,060
jump from your wearable device to your

268
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,150
mobile phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then monitor your bank</font>

269
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,680
account that's exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sexy to me</font>

270
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:56,689
as an attacker right control you know if

271
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,030
I can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone or you know just</font>

272
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,310
for fun like I'm having a friendly

273
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,939
competition to have more steps than John

274
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,430
my buddy and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to beat him so I</font>

275
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,900
find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to hack his Fitbit and his</font>

276
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,300
steps are only half of what he really

277
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:14,750
took right and then money obviously

278
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,910
money monetary is usually one of the

279
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest thing that attackers are after</font>

280
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:23,150
so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see it is there's really</font>

281
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,400
four kind of areas of attack the device

282
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,890
itself communication channels there's

283
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,480
lots of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> right parent devices what</font>

284
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,120
those might be and I say devices because

285
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,350
sometimes you can connect to multiple

286
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,590
and then any web components that are in

287
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:42,860
plano cloud infrastructures and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

288
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:45,290
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my ugly little picture here of</font>

289
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,460
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the the landscape might</font>

290
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,660
look like right as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it might</font>

291
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,550
look complex but it's pretty

292
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">straightforward for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part the</font>

293
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,630
upper path is what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

294
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,250
when we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at wearables right</font>

295
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,400
there's some peripheral if you will

296
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,770
that's connecting to a central

297
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,630
or a parent<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then is probably</font>

298
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,140
straining that information to some cloud

299
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,600
service or back end web service in some

300
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,520
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the connected pacemaker it's</font>

301
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,580
just going directly over a cellular

302
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,819
connection and they're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

303
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,650
that's more secure because of it so

304
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,370
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places to screw up</font>

305
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,569
right I think we know that you know a

306
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of us developers have been around</font>

307
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,100
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> long enough that we know where the</font>

308
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,640
problem areas might be but it doesn't

309
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,340
mean we've ever fixed it right and you

310
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,790
know these concern me from a wearable

311
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:42,730
perspective so let's talk about attacks

312
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,640
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wearable device for the most</font>

313
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,920
part I'd say you would need physical or

314
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,939
close proximity access right I mean

315
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,430
close proximity bluetooth what<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1300</font>

316
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">meters in some cases I've seen things</font>

317
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,479
about it going a thousand but it's still

318
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,370
for the most part you're not attacking

319
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth from across country right</font>

320
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,270
unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got something set up in</font>

321
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle of downtown New York City if</font>

322
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,150
you might so small victim pool right I

323
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,469
mean so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoods</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be low</font>

324
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,990
because you can need to have that closer

325
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,880
access unless there are some input api's

326
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,610
that are exposed through some other

327
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,640
mechanism whether it's HTTP collapse

328
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,920
what heavy impacts probably medium or

329
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,840
low again just because it's a small

330
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,839
victim pool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably can't get a whole</font>

331
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,800
lot of data from a single device all

332
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,950
right then<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I want that's</font>

333
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I want I want the data to set you</font>

334
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,910
know I did a manipulation control maybe

335
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,400
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly have just an apparent</font>

336
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,980
device you know with like the Fitbit hat

337
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,829
but if the key here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you don't really</font>

338
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be a hacker for these wearable</font>

339
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:50,950
devices if I got my hands on one it's

340
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:54,100
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be pretty easy to get</font>

341
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,250
data or whatever's on that device off we

342
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,750
don't have poison pills remote kill

343
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,970
anything like that on wearable devices

344
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,980
because their connectivity is through a

345
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,800
parent device for the most part they're

346
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:09,250
not connecting directly to some service

347
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,640
layer right so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal a</font>

348
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,710
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these devices at the local gym</font>

349
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,430
for instance I could probably get data

350
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:20,520
off of those but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

351
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,410
small victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> pool right even if I got</font>

352
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,720
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not all</font>

353
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:30,689
that important or sexy to sell so what

354
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,700
about the communication channel right I

355
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,700
think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

356
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,260
scary so for the most part most of these

357
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,670
wearables are using bluetooth you know

358
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,490
like Apple watch uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth and</font>

359
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,959
Wi-Fi if it's available some of some

360
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,940
other ones let you cellular somebody's

361
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,180
Wi-Fi but for the most part they're

362
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,700
using bluetooth you know so if people

363
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to stand up bluetooth sniffers they</font>

364
00:15:50,700 --> 00:16:02,010
can definitely do that right anyone used

365
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:03,750
crackle so crackle actually it doesn't

366
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,770
work against the newest versions of

367
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:10,140
building but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to take a</font>

368
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,540
packet capture so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use like</font>

369
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:16,500
Wireshark or whatever captured<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth</font>

370
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,569
traffic save<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to a pcap file and</font>

371
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,450
then crack will actually go through that

372
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:24,960
pcap file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> crack long-term keys for</font>

373
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:27,150
Bluetooth and that that works against 40

374
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,910
and 41 I believe I don't necessarily

375
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,310
think it works in 42 we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 42</font>

376
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,550
but so these devices why do they use

377
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">bluetooth the new billing stuff because</font>

378
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,410
low power low cost low bandwidth low

379
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,319
latency right and the big one is low

380
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,329
power these are tiny devices and if you

381
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:49,260
have to recharge your<font color="#E5E5E5"> device every four</font>

382
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:53,280
hours you're not going to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like</font>

383
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:55,680
the Apple watch sucks for one day right

384
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,449
but then I think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm not</font>

385
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,550
gonna work sleeping so I might as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

386
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,430
charge a lot of sleeping but still even

387
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:05,099
that to me sucks you know when I had the

388
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nike FuelBand which was crap by the way</font>

389
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:12,409
anyone see the class<font color="#CCCCCC"> action against that</font>

390
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:15,270
it was fake data like it was horrible

391
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,880
but anyway that would last me 10-15 days

392
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,680
one charge that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more</font>

393
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,260
realistic to me but it was also using

394
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">low power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bluetooth and not doing near</font>

395
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,270
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

396
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,129
gavel<font color="#CCCCCC"> wajah students or have the screen</font>

397
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make lets me use pretty images for</font>

398
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the background so there were some</font>

399
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,480
serious security issues in bluetooth and

400
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,850
ble when I first came out but they

401
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,370
supposedly been fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 42 but i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

402
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,580
there's still problems right you know

403
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,350
they're always listening or sending

404
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,030
signals or looking for peripherals

405
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,580
they're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Central's right so</font>

406
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,610
they're continually sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff across</font>

407
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,030
the year so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to find</font>

408
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,770
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues in that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the other</font>

409
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,050
the other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they may be using</font>

410
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">our HTTP or co-op anyone worked with</font>

411
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect so co-op is basically HTTP / UDP</font>

412
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,180
it gets created because these are very

413
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,920
small devices it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

414
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,210
constrained protocol I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

415
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,070
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> called constrained but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

416
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,120
UDP so it's not guaranteed delivery it's

417
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,070
for kind of pub sub type of requests and

418
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,889
it's fast right I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

419
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,510
key with this HTTP is just too complex

420
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,150
for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these these tiny little</font>

421
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,379
wearable devices and if you stay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

422
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:37,270
next talk you'll get more info about

423
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,950
coop just just a plug for that so what

424
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,750
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean from an attacker</font>

425
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,660
perspective so<font color="#CCCCCC"> likelihood is probably</font>

426
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:46,810
medium to high you know close proximity

427
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,100
access is not required in all cases you

428
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,260
know if you can attack that

429
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,110
communication channel through the prayer

430
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,920
device or it is sending over cellular or

431
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,479
Wi-Fi you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it remotely you know</font>

432
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that means there's multiple</font>

433
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,830
victim with multiple victims increasing

434
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,720
attacker motivation if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have</font>

435
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,570
multiple people attack multiple people

436
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,820
get much more data that's a whole lot

437
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,000
more motivating to me that if i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

438
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,500
attack one person you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

439
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,410
communication channels are established

440
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,510
standards so that means if you find a

441
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,960
flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them it's not known or</font>

442
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:26,610
even if it is no you can attack that and

443
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,200
lots of plaintext<font color="#CCCCCC"> api are available</font>

444
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,159
impacts high data compromise really

445
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,130
depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data i had a good</font>

446
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,100
question posed to me like why is some of

447
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,520
this data important

448
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:41,449
and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you know for instance</font>

449
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,629
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to grab everyone's Fitbit</font>

450
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,460
data from the entire US would I be able

451
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:49,460
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell that like why would that be</font>

452
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,320
important to me well if I'm an

453
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,730
organization that's targeting someone

454
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's more active who has 15,000 steps a</font>

455
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,250
day I'm probably going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> purchase that</font>

456
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:04,460
data so i can target that market right

457
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,460
so that data is still sexy to me because

458
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,919
you know i can now say hey these million

459
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,140
people they averaged over 15,000 steps a

460
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:22,549
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have all their email addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

461
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:27,559
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can spam yeah right yep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yep</font>

462
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:30,440
exactly yeah oh I'm sure they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do why</font>

463
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,340
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they right why wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

464
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,429
already sell it right heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font>

465
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a bad idea mr. warden Fitbit so</font>

466
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:41,120
where would I go I go to a gym right I'd

467
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,450
go downtown New York City<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font>

468
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,158
gym there is and just start listening

469
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:49,429
I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to do that anyone want</font>

470
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go for coffee and just see because I</font>

471
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,690
mean I guarantee everyone at that gym

472
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,120
has some sort of wearable that's

473
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,650
tracking something whether it's a watch

474
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,780
a wristband you know giappone Fitbit

475
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,549
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten billion of them right so I</font>

476
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,770
guarantee some people have at least one

477
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,740
is not more with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

478
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,429
going on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where I would go so</font>

479
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,789
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

480
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:19,330
device itself mobile devices in 2014 5.2

481
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:21,650
million or lost or stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a lot</font>

482
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,860
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing that that hasn't</font>

483
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,980
decreased for numerous reasons people

484
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:29,809
are stupid I mean let's be real how many

485
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you just sat in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone</font>

486
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:34,158
down and kind of walked away even<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

487
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,320
feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> away that so it could be or left in</font>

488
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,250
a cab<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an airplane in a coffee shop I</font>

489
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,928
can't tell you the number times I've sat

490
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,360
in a coffee shop watch someone

491
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:45,230
physically get up walk to the bathroom

492
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,189
and leave

493
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:51,200
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the table come on man but it</font>

494
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,720
happens you know some of the phone

495
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,150
manufacturers are trying to work on

496
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,870
fixing that problem but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

497
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,070
ways around it so attacks against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

498
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,189
parent mobile device are pretty high

499
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,950
there's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with android</font>

500
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,730
iOS what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part</font>

501
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:17,600
that's the big market right who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

502
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:20,809
blackberry no one windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone that was</font>

503
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,260
a big fail so attack will require

504
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,428
physical access obviously you know

505
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,910
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's through a jailbreak a</font>

506
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:31,370
root malware something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so many</font>

507
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,870
vices watch are stolen and most aren't

508
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,110
up to date i mean Android model still

509
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:38,209
sucks right how many Android devices are

510
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,030
still running very old versions of the

511
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,429
android OS which makes it easy there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

512
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,928
just saw another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yesterday with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

513
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,900
android lock screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass you just</font>

514
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:51,530
paste a string of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lights 41,000</font>

515
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:53,360
characters and bypasses<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passcode</font>

516
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,000
because it freaks out so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's</font>

517
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,979
some sort of buffer overflow and just

518
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,330
let you in good job nice job to go so

519
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,040
compromised device data small victim

520
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,770
pool because you know it's still a

521
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:11,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">single device you know so it's not as</font>

522
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:14,240
sexy as more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that so what what big</font>

523
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,470
happened in 2014 well seventy-five

524
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,700
percent year-over-year increase in

525
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,700
mobile malware I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

526
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down this year one in five this</font>

527
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,559
the surprise me I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the data</font>

528
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:27,140
behind this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 125 Android users experience</font>

529
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,860
a mobile threat not sure what that means

530
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,750
but it sounds scary and a two hundred

531
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,439
sixty-two percent increase in the number

532
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:39,590
of iOS vulnerabilities now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

533
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,169
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what 30 I don't know but</font>

534
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">still you know and actually that link</font>

535
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,790
that's posted there has tons and tons

536
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,489
more and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a pretty good</font>

537
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">argument but it links out to all of the</font>

538
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,790
data that's available for each one of

539
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,470
them so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

540
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk to people so they'll spend</font>

541
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,000
money it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to go but the</font>

542
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,799
last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the one that's really</font>

543
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sexy to me right I want to attack where</font>

544
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,270
the data is really like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the data</font>

545
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,879
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get all the data and if it be</font>

546
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,220
able to sell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that's fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

547
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,620
likelihoods medium obviously there's got

548
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,010
to be problems in it on the cloud

549
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,239
back-end or web infrastructure and there

550
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,240
have to be some sort of vulnerability

551
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,740
that they exploit which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure there's</font>

552
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,620
probably direct object reference

553
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,320
problems with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these right you</font>

554
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,809
know compromise user data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

555
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">then turn around and sell pretty quickly</font>

556
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:33,889
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big thing with a lot of</font>

557
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:37,610
these is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to identify call out</font>

558
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:40,280
or track specific people right if

559
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">President Obama is wearing a Fitbit it</font>

560
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:47,678
might be interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to know where</font>

561
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,678
he's at and stuff on a daily basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

562
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,770
so let's let's talk about addressing the

563
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,620
issues again this is going to be some

564
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">high level stuff because honestly from a</font>

565
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,500
technology standpoint the issues haven't

566
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:05,540
been fixed yet for the most part right

567
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:09,049
so fixing the attacks against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

568
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,149
will this one's tough but not storing

569
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,220
data or much data at all in the

570
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:16,490
peripheral is probably a smart idea if

571
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,010
you do store that data make it anonymous

572
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,320
right what's the point of tying that

573
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,340
data to someone else or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

574
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,960
person when really the central or the

575
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,889
mobile device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's connecting to is</font>

576
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,350
where that data should be tied right my

577
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">name and so on shouldn't be on my Fitbit</font>

578
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,610
itself it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just track the steps</font>

579
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,710
and anything else that's important to it

580
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,290
and send them up to the central whatever

581
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can as many times as it's searching</font>

582
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,520
for it anyways<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a</font>

583
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,500
poison pill or kill switch is probably a

584
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">good idea for these if there's no</font>

585
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">check-in or it doesn't connect to the</font>

586
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,100
central for a period of time kill the

587
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,610
damn thing they're easy to set back up

588
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,629
right remove all that data remove

589
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,949
anything on it

590
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,070
fixing communication channel issues this

591
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,679
is the really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardest one to me</font>

592
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:10,510
because using Billy 42 is great and I

593
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,789
can say do it do it do it but the

594
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:17,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem most of the peripherals don't</font>

595
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:20,590
support it yet so that being said you

596
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't use it the weird thing about</font>

597
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,330
bluetooth which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about here in</font>

598
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:27,820
the next slide is it's not necessarily

599
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">like let's talk like TLS right the</font>

600
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,070
server kind of controls how that TLS

601
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,080
connection is going to work it says I

602
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,269
accept these ciphers and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

603
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the biggest one the client shouldn't</font>

604
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:42,899
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come back saying well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

605
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:45,789
do week ssl v2 or something right

606
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:51,250
whereas with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth they both have to</font>

607
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree so if i could go here there's four</font>

608
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,970
different types of authentication in BLD

609
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,649
for dot to just works which means

610
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,700
there's no authentication they just pair

611
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:04,959
gross numeric comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass key entry</font>

612
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,190
which are very similar one of them the

613
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,809
numeric comparison is something that's

614
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,450
hard coded into the actual wearable

615
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:12,908
itself so hard coded key that's probably

616
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,470
in the owners manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass key entry is</font>

617
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,620
something that's created shown on a

618
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:19,179
screen so if the wearable has a screen

619
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,549
most of them use<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass key entry so</font>

620
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:24,149
here's six digits type it in your your

621
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:28,269
central and<font color="#CCCCCC"> param and then out of band</font>

622
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:30,219
so the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's flags in this</font>

623
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth communication that determines</font>

624
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,720
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication method is used and</font>

625
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,269
if I'm creating a mobile app that needs

626
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,190
to connect to a wearable and I want to

627
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">use out-of-band authentication you know</font>

628
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some picture image 128-bit</font>

629
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,220

630
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:51,220
no autumn and they automatically fall

631
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,870
back to the next level right there's

632
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,450
also a flag for<font color="#E5E5E5"> man-in-the-middle</font>

633
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,559

641
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,560
to me right

642
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,090
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully Bluetooth fixes some of</font>

643
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,340
that and lets the<font color="#CCCCCC"> central kind of</font>

644
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,899
control that a little bit more but again

645
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's tough because not a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">even support bluetooth for dot to</font>

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,940
of them very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but they've fixed some</font>

652
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:48,290
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's using diffie-hellman</font>

653
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,700
which we can argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all day but it</font>

654
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,889
supposedly fixed some of the key

655
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,830
exchange issues they had in the earlier

656
00:28:51,890 --> 00:29:00,080
versions so what about bluetooth on iOS

657
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,909
iOS itself is pretty good supports ble

658
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,750
security load for which is the highest

659
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:08,150
security mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple watch and handoff</font>

660
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,920
anyone use the watcher handoff it

661
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,510
supports out-of-band authentication so

662
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,770
that's how you authenticate you see a

663
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,629
picture there from the watch to the

664
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,460
phone you hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone up to it with</font>

665
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,900
the camera and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it authenticates through</font>

666
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,220
that it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like NFC right but</font>

667
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:25,910
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> different the problem in this is</font>

668
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:29,030
weird core<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth the iOS AP is only</font>

669
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,440
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed here just works so if you</font>

670
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,810
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use any of the others like out</font>

671
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,300
of band or numeric comparison you have

672
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:38,179
to write custom code or right at a lower

673
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,530
level right right some C or C++ like a

674
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,420
shared library that does all the

675
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,210
bluetooth because core<font color="#CCCCCC"> bluetooth does</font>

676
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,830
not provide that for you which<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprises</font>

677
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,620
me hopefully they get soon and there's

678
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:53,990
no access to NFC so we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

679
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">band over NFC in iOS android while it</font>

680
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:00,530
took longer to support ble for dot 0 & 1

681
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:04,100
& 2 it's supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of band for quite</font>

682
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:06,889
a lot right so you can in your code do

683
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,199
NFC pairing which will be considered out

684
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">of band bluetooth which i highly</font>

685
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend doing it's a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

686
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,879
stronger and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication</font>

687
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,330
channels you've been forced TLS and

688
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,460
whatever down your throats long enough

689
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,168
co-op uses detail us Datagram transport

690
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,539
layer security

691
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:29,479
so very similar to TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 dot 2 which is</font>

692
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:34,460
for UDP and then sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> pinning anyone here</font>

693
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:36,139
doing sir kidding yeah that's all right

694
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know as we get more sensitive</font>

695
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:42,289
apps and so on sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinning is definitely</font>

696
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:46,639
going to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important good at</font>

697
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:49,009
putting time attacks against device you

698
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:51,859
know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hawass mobile top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

699
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:54,919

700
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:57,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">a control based advocate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than looking at</font>

701
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,999
specific risks so I highly recommend

702
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:02,359
checking that out it hasn't been updated

703
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:04,039
for for quite a while but I think the

704
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:06,589
key here too is if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some</font>

705
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,109
Bluetooth disconnect from peripherals

706
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:11,529
when you no longer need them you know so

707
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:14,359
don't don't constantly look for them

708
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:17,929
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan for them when they are needed</font>

709
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:21,728
and do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this order right retrieve</font>

710
00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:24,789
that any connected peripherals first

711
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:27,349
retrieve any known peripheral second and

712
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:29,929
then third and only if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't find</font>

00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:31,700
them scan is that scanning is where

714
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,769
you're going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into trouble with</font>

715
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,450
people sniffing and all that because of

716
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:41,719
all the exchange of keys is going on and

717
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:44,389
then secondly past the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 controls</font>

718
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:46,509
is the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine mobile risks I say nine</font>

719
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:49,488
because I'm not a fan of number<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

720
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:51,409
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of other people but i</font>

721
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:57,649
think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these will be updated</font>

722
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:59,629
hopefully within a year or so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

723
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:02,359
the cloud there's a newer project with a

724
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:04,849
wasp cloud top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 you know I think</font>

725
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,769
clouds only going to get bigger big data

726
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">is only going to get bigger and that's</font>

727
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:10,909
really what these devices are doing

728
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:12,440
their they're storing data lots of it

729
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:13,879
you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there might be</font>

730
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,299
storing more data than they're even

731
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:18,830
showing you right i mean fitbit might be

732
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:22,129
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stephs but what other data</font>

733
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:26,449
are they tracking and saving that you

734
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:29,809
know might not know about right so what

735
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,840
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future hold well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

738
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:43,360

739
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:46,990
is is BYOD is now WI OD where your own

742
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,460
thing where you can get corporate

743
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,709
accounts and distribute devices to all

744
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,960
your employees and<font color="#E5E5E5"> track their you know</font>

745
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,610
you know I guess you know it makes a

746
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">little sense right so a big organization</font>

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,220
control that you know does ever

752
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,010
participate does that Fitbit connect to

753
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:22,870
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal devices or is it</font>

00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:24,399
connecting to a company owns device you

755
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,459
know how is that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> then managed who</font>

data that's interesting and is there p i

759
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:38,020
involved so these questions are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">start coming up sooner than later this</font>

AP is for any app to connect to them and

770
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,260
take whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> data those wearables are</font>

771

going to give them and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

Canada right now but it tracks things

782
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,149
like heart rate you know monitors other

783
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,149
heat sensors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on it's got a</font>

784
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:41,888
fingerprint sensor built into it so

785
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:42,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone can use a fingerprint an</font>

90 devices through NFC actually data

increase you know Nike I'm sure under

00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:01,080
armour is working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some things</font>

792
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:03,810
that they implant in where you know

793
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,020
shirts and workout gear and whatever

794
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:09,960
else to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> target specific muscles</font>

795
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,120
and workouts and all of that it allows

796
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,340
trainers to you know set up specific

797
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,140
regimens for you know specific

798
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,430
individuals it makes it easier for them

799
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,879
with all the data they're going to get

800
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">from these and doctors to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right at some</font>

801
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,350
point we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing things</font>

802
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,810
that real time stream our health

803
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,490
information to our doctors and they'll

804
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,290
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey man did you know your heart</font>

805
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,959
rates been<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevated for the last week</font>

806
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:37,200
what's going on right that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

807
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,550
happen I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee it some of us</font>

808
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,140
might like that because someone's might

809
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,390
not like doctors they're going to them

810
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,440
but I'd rather actually physically go in

811
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:49,290
and see then how about stop smoking so

812
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,420
they're working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some interesting</font>

813
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,430
things that up that that little thing

814
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,580
there is a pump right so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

815
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:59,220
got nicotine in it and you wear it and

816
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:02,850
the app tracks your nicotine levels

817
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,950
weird and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will inject nicotine into you</font>

818
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:08,220
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it detects that you might need it</font>

820
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,790
it's October there's breast cancer

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:16,590
detection technologies going on right

822
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">there wearables that are implanted in</font>

else is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen there's going to</font>

be bridges you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what data is</font>

829

involved it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen sooner</font>

830
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,910
than later probably you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a</font>

regulation like I said the sharing of

837
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,560
data i think is the piece that's really

838
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,680
going to explode here

839
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,960
right whether it's allowing different

840
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,339
apps to connect to different wearables

841
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,160
or people selling data to target certain

842
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,560
people for purchasing new wearables or

843
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,660
whatever else it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely going to</font>

846
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,919
they start coming up with stupid

847
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,530
regulations that say make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it unlawful to</font>

848
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,600
hack cars without even thinking about it

849
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,630
they're there they're clueless right

850
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,490
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yet so it might be</font>

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:38,140
bad happens but that's kind of how I see

854
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:40,660
it that's me wow that was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

855
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">right on time so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions about</font>

856
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth and connections and using the</font>

857
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:50,110
same connection and so on so short

858
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,399
answer is sort of right so what just

859
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,530
works just<font color="#E5E5E5"> works does it provide</font>

860
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">man-in-the-middle protections so those</font>

861
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,520
that just pair right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still using</font>

862
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get me wrong there's key</font>

863
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,160
exchange and so on but man in the middle

864
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">and connecting once they paired what</font>

865
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,420
just works is not protecting that so

866
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,300
you'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so any device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

867
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,460
you're using it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just connects know that</font>

868
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,650
you're vulnerable the other three

869
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,040
options the passkey numeric comparison

870
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">an out-of-band they do provide mental</font>

871
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,970
protections but some of the previous

872
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:27,430
hacks allowed attackers to figure out

873
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term key which is that last key</font>

874
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,520
that they use to do all they're

875
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,649
exchanging once you've figured that out

876
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,620
you'd be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in and use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

877
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:38,650
same connection with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it's</font>

878
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,270
designed to prevent it but if there are

879
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">vulnerabilities like we're seeing in 40</font>

880
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,950
and 41 you'd still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to get</font>

881
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">into that connection so yeah the</font>

882
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,890
question is about IOT and all the other

883
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:52,120
stuff the nonhuman wearables and yes I

884
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,339
mean the threats are probably different

885
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,200
you know if if I'm implanting things

886
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,680
into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle that's helping control</font>

887
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,270
that vehicle there's a different threat

888
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,520
there right depending on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

889
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,259
connecting back you know is using some

890
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,860
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in cellular Wi-Fi</font>

891
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,610
capabilities to

892
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,830
send data retrieving and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

893
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,630
your attacker audience is probably

894
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,790
changing too I mean that might be more

895
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,550
attractive from a you know cybersecurity

896
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:22,550
threat then for instance figuring out

897
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,020
your Fitbit data yeah critical

898
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,510
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they've got it</font>

899
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,520
got sensors everywhere you know a

900
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,110
nuclear powerplants powerplants in

901
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,410
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> gas electric what have you</font>

902
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:35,120
they've got sensors in every foot to

903
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,759
know when something's wrong well those

904
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:41,230
sensors are<font color="#CCCCCC"> now starting streaming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

905
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,720
over the Internet or allowing people to

906
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:49,220
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> something back to them that's where</font>

907
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,890
we in trouble yep well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

908
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:55,910
this recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> vivek attack is that right</font>

909
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:57,680
so she was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send those 17 bytes</font>

910
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,390
of malicious payload now it wasn't

911
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,339
malicious payload she just showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

912
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,770
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then it would go to</font>

913
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,960
the Fitbit device which then<font color="#E5E5E5"> screamed it</font>

914
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,759
up to the parent so whatever if there's

915
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,010
a flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the parent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it runs that</font>

916
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,830
malicious payload then it you're exactly

917
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:15,710
right I mean that's very sexy right if

918
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,900
you can get a jump off point if you will

919
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a pivot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point from the wearable</font>

920
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,700
to whatever is on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

921
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy to be</font>

922
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone just</font>

923
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,520
listen to someone or whatever yeah

924
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,720
that's that's something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

925
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a concern with these</font>

926
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,870
wearables because they are they're all

927
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,850
connected to something or they don't

928
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just Nestle it like just this watch</font>

929
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,940
sucks on its own it tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

930
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,920
but doesn't do anything else what a

931
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,570
microphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> again based behind a watch</font>

932
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,090
that I do have a connect to the watch

933
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me no big denry goes off</font>

934
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,040
to watch and I can

935
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,050
just the surface but again with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

936
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,690
proximity right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to be real close</font>

937
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:58,490
I the question is about has anyone

938
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:00,380
created any malicious<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth devices</font>

939
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,839
that just automatically connect to those

940
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,869
that are just works so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing with</font>

941
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,890
with even what just works for the most

942
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:12,080
part they have to be in a pairing mode

943
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:14,589
right so you have someone has to push a

944
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:19,100
button<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it into a specific mode</font>

945
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:22,100
older bluetooth they had that attack

946
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,810
right people had apps that would just go

947
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,359
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pair it everything I</font>

948
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,619
haven't seen anything with BLD but I

949
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,990
wouldn't doubt if there was something

950
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:32,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but</font>

951
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,040
again would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> le you have to forcibly</font>

952
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:36,529
put something into pairing mode it's

953
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,700
just not always in pairing mode even

954
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:43,010
with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn t research into</font>

955
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,720
how many collab devices are actually two

956
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,720
btls or interesting out

957
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,080
no I had done and I hope you stay for

958
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next talk because I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack might</font>

959
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:59,230
know that question question was about

960
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,390
coop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls and what no deep co-op is</font>

961
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:05,220
pretty much used for INT right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

962
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:07,569
your home type devices and so on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

963
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,790
turn on your lights shut and close your

964
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:12,730
garage door and so on they're using

965
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:15,700
co-op for the most part or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> bpt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

966
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:17,560
some other hopefully at some point we

967
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,919
get down to just a few because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

968
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:27,580
about 30 different<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OT protocols at</font>

969
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:30,120
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think anything else alright</font>

970
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,120
thanks guys
