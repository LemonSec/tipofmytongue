00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,650
I used to live here for two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:32,259
absolutely loved it now I live in

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:35,839
Maryland which is cool but not as cool

5
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:40,400
don't I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my wife now knows now it's</font>

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,860
on video anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,460
take a journey today and you have a

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:51,260
choice from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the blue pill or</font>

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,420
the red pill first before that a show of

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:59,360
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many of you have a software</font>

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:01,940
supply chain yeah how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you don't</font>

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,580
have a software supply chain hands hands

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,850
held high don't be embarrassed it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,280
more people didn't than did at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least by</font>

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:14,449
the show<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hands okay so the blue pill</font>

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,470
is the story ends now you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,030
software supply chain right and you know

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:23,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to really pay attention</font>

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,509
the red pill though is the journey of

20
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:29,869
the conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

21
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">take you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and for those of you with</font>

22
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,990
blue pills out there I had to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

23
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">Deming quote because we're talking about</font>

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:43,699
DevOps you read it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

25
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">say it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within supply chains a lot of</font>

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,679
you that have read anything about DevOps

27
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,909
read the Phoenix project by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gene Kim</font>

28
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:52,850
that everyone's saying you should read

29
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:55,009
and you should read I'll join the

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,928
bandwagon I've already been on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

31
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:01,700
already read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anyway with in</font>

32
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:04,640
manufacturing there are supply chains

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,390
and every manufacturer whether you are

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,699
manufacturing packaged goods like ground

35
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:14,029
beef whether you are making automobiles

36
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,100
drugs toys what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and you're</font>

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,190
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at high velocity you have a</font>

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,370
supply chain within within your

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,859
organization as a manufacturer you know

40
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,720
you have a set of suppliers and not just

41
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,360
any suppliers you would pick the best

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,310
suppliers and those suppliers give you

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,110
the best quality parts

44
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,030
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have 15 different</font>

45
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,819
suppliers for part to have the best

46
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,950
supplier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best specific part and</font>

47
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:43,220
you have their latest stuff you're not

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,280
buying their stuff from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years ago and</font>

using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in manufacturing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and when you</font>

also know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what parts went into what</font>

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:04,340
products and where those went so when

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,549
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put a nut and bolt into a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blah that went into because when that</font>

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,769
bolt goes bad you want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

59
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,929
tell the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have those bolts or</font>

60
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:24,069
whatever it might be or those brakes are

61
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:27,650
those defective ignition switches or

62
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,660
ingredient you have that we saw a

63
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,230
problem with it we're going to recall it

64
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,709
it's bad we'll replace it this is super

65
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,980
effective in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would guess any of</font>

66
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:41,750
you in here cannot imagine our world

67
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,910
operating in a way where they didn't

68
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,260
select the better parts and put them

69
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,329
into the products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

70
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,780
traceability imagine if you could never

71
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:53,329
recall tainted beef if you could never

72
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,040
recall the car with bad brakes if you

73
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,530
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> never recall the drug that are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause some major health issue</font>

75
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:07,639
right it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work that way but</font>

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,260
then their software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

sonatype never heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys so</font>

79
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:18,079
anyone in software development has heard

<font color="#E5E5E5">of us because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone uses our products</font>

or services they just don't use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sono</font>

82

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,770
run something called the maven central

repository it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest open source</font>

85
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,870
repository on the planet we hold a

86
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,910
million components in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell</font>

87
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,370
you more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume as we move</font>

88
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,039
through the discussions but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,650
hundred thousand-plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,680
organizations that contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

91
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,650
central repository we hand

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,620
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't get ahead of myself on the</font>

93
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,539
slides on the volume but a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

94
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,490
six thousand software development

95
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:58,900
organizations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet pulled</font>

96
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,669
components from us last year so when you

97
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,979
live at sonatype you get a lot of

98
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,900
insight into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what developers are doing</font>

99
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,880
and what open source projects are doing

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,919
and contributing in the quality and

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrity of those components in the</font>

102
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,240
consumption and all that but only

103
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,289
sonatype knows and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sonu</font>

104
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,860
type I said everyone should know so we i

105
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,750
sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for three months earlier this</font>

106
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,949
year and produce some research to reveal

107
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to share that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

108
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:29,590
you today and everyone here will get a

109
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:32,139
copy of my slides I'll show you how at

110
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the very end of the presentation so that</font>

111
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:38,740
you can take these home with you as well

112
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,680
as the research report so in software we

113
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,020
have a supply chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> every one of you</font>

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> developing software today has a</font>

115
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:58,120
software supply chain you are all red

116
00:05:46,240 --> 00:06:00,789
pillars within within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so open</font>

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,220
source projects are your suppliers those

118
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,860
suppliers put things in two warehouses

119
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,130
like the central repository rubygems.org

120
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,460
pi PI org the nougat gallery bin tray

121
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,070
whatever it whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be there</font>

122
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,948
are also warehouses that you use locally

123
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,659
like a nexus repository<font color="#CCCCCC"> to host those</font>

124
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:23,259
components as well as your own

125
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:25,599
proprietary binaries that you create

126
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nexus is one of our products there's</font>

127
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:31,740
60,000 instances worldwide so chances

128
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,940
are you might be using it and then

129
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,240
manufacturers your development teams

130
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,190
that finished goods are the applications

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,349
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a software supply chain and</font>

132
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,690
my report went into how does this

133
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,580
software supply chain work and how does

134
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">it behave so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk you</font>

135
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">through a little bit about that supply</font>

136
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,200
chain but from an application securities

137
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,370
perspective what you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is</font>

138
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,639
software development has changed

139
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,530
dramatically and processes throughout

140
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,370
the organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> support it like</font>

141
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,258
application security have not the pace

142
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of consumption in the volume of</font>

143
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,810
consumption is gigantic software

144
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,789
development has changed but our process

145
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,009
hasn't changed enough and for those of

146
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,210

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,289

152
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,930
those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't visualize it</font>

153
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:40,270
can't see it and can't control it people

154
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,090
like Nigel Simpson who's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead</font>

158
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,419
unthink it right so the volume just in

159
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,699
maven central alone these are just the

160
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:02,289
Java components but Java is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the largest</font>

161
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:06,339
open source population globally we did

162
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:10,990
17 billion download request last year

163
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:14,259
from maven central<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are only</font>

164
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,899
10 million Java developers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet</font>

165
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:19,289
my mother is not one of them she doesn't

166
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:23,080
download anything from maven central

167
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:26,139
that growth has grown 30 fold over the

168
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,180
last seven years<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year I'm sure it</font>

169
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,909
will we haven't heard the early numbers

170
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,310
but I'm sure it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be over 20 billion</font>

171
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:36,968
based on the current current rate of

172
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,728
some some things so with that said lots

173
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,800
of open source being consumed it's being

174
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,779
used by developers that means it's going

175
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,170
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your applications what percent of</font>

178
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pulled from the internet so you</font>

179
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:57,970
could assemble and develop faster and be

180
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:01,120
more efficient in your organization what

yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I have a smart audience here</font>

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,620
most most audiences even the the Java

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,350
developers Java user groups I do go to

187
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,210
don't get that so quickly so ninety

188
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,490
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty to ninety percent of a</font>

components today ten percent is code

191
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,500
that you assembled if how many of you

192
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,810
are using SAS solutions right scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

applications analyze them you know what

194
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,560
that covers the ten percent right those

195
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,110
SAS applications don't cover the ninety

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,689
percent of what are known

199
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:56,110
on that later in modern supply chains to

200
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,449
operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at extremely high velocity and</font>

201

out<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the only way that these</font>

203
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,560
organizations can do this is through

204
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,650
automation how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> identify the</font>

205
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,439
highest quality suppliers with the best

00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:19,220
quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts and keep and track and</font>

207
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">trace those across their life cycle when</font>

208
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,200
you're dealing with hundreds of

209
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,640
thousands of components millions of

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,280
components and some of the largest

211
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,760
organizations when you have manual

212
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:34,610
processes they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely not be</font>

213
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,760
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep up we'll talk about the</font>

214
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,040
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> source projects so this slide is</font>

215
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,490
continuously outdated but I did update

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,000
it last night around midnight so we're

217
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,240
close to at least there are 1.1 million

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">components in maven central right now</font>

219
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,160
those come from a hundred and twenty

220
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,770
thousand suppliers and there are 10 or

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:02,990
11 million developers this is just in

222
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:05,300
one open source language if you will so

223
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,550
not counting Ruby and not net developers

224
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:14,290
and all the components and they change

225
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,290
three to four<font color="#CCCCCC"> times a year so within</font>

226
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,050
clicker happy today so within your

227
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,029
organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not using a hundred</font>

228
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and twenty thousand open source projects</font>

229
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,389
right so how many projects are you using

230
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,339
the slide windpipes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of you might</font>

231
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,269
have caught a quick glimpse how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

232
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:36,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're using in your</font>

233

234
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,949
show a hand we're gonna we got a lot of

235
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,949
slides to move through nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

236
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,899
7600 suppliers on average when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I looked</font>

237
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:52,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">across the organization's and I looked</font>

238
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:55,889
at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many projects on average is the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization using different projects</font>

240
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:04,059
7600 if you include every version of

241
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:09,610
those projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18,000 unique parts from</font>

242
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:15,969
those suppliers Toyota firm-wide has 500

243
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:19,329
suppliers GM has<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,500</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right a software</font>

244
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,519
development organization has more than

245
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:26,550
that the average downloads per

246
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:31,509
organization were 240,000 / development

247
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:34,599
organization last year you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a sense</font>

248
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,720
of volume there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an</font>

249
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,179
important theme here did you have a

250
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:46,649
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um now how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font>

251
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:51,339
have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> well yeah heart blade bash</font>

252
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:53,319
poodle whatever venom all those logo to

253
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,959
open-source things so every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

254
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,389
those articles comes out we get the with

255
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,008
many eyeballs you know all bugs or

256
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:02,100
shallow kind of comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like</font>

257
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:04,980
eight blogs in the week that those

258
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,920
mentioning linus torvalds in that

259
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:11,379
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the new logo vulnerability</font>

260
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,269
coming out so we did an analysis of

261
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,759
maven central in the hundred

262
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:18,309
thousand-plus components that are in

263
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:21,490
there and we said when there is a

264
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:25,240
vulnerability in a component or its

265
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,730
dependency a direct dependency of that

266
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,730
project how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

267
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,269
are those vulnerabilities ever fixed

268
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:41,440
right so fifty-nine percent of the time

269
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:45,130
they are never never fixed yeah at the

270
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,600
component level right this means you're

271
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,880
releasing if you're an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,360
project three or four versions a year

273
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have 50 more versions</font>

274
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,610
pass when the vulnerability was known

275
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,740
and discovered you haven't corrected the

276
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,510
vulnerability in any of those future

277
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,760
releases when the CBS s score was above

278
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,850
10 and it was corrected the average time

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,089
to correct it for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project was 224</font>

280
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,000
days that means before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it in</font>

281
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,949
your application development teams now

282
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,630
add on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time that it takes you to</font>

283
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:24,760
take the good component and remediate it

284
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,529
for a level ten right for banks I read

285
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,860
somewhere i think it was six months ago

286
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:33,579
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 190 days is a good average</font>

287
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,190
right so 190 + 224<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a long time the</font>

288
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:40,420
best projects did this<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under a week</font>

289
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:43,329
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best project said I have a</font>

290
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,260
vulnerability in my project<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

291
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:48,939
release a new version fast when you

292
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,040
think about the suppliers that you're

293
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:56,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you want to work with these</font>

294
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:02,920

297
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are lots of components in the Java</font>

world pick any development language and

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,510
you'll see there are hundreds of

300

thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different modules across</font>

the different languages and if you're

00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,880
interested in whatever language you're

303

are out there module counts calm it's

cleaner when you get the slides and i'll

250 million downloads a year right again

314
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,120
think about the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dotnet</font>

315
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:53,700
developers and then compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">big in the problem that we have is the</font>

318
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:03,529
communication from the projects right

319
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:06,390
and the components<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the developers is</font>

320
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,580
broken when heartbleed hits national

321
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,589
news right people hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it there</font>

322
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,529
are 50 vulnerability new vulnerabilities

323
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:16,980
every day right but the developers that

324
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:18,689
use the components don't hear about what

325
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,160
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they just use the component</font>

326
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,200
because it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> them faster and they</font>

327
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,819
get their products out the door faster

328
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,690
it makes them<font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficient and we are</font>

329
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,750
gigantic advocates of open source and

330
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,670
using that but you have to pick the best

331
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,740
quality part from the best quality

332
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:41,069
suppliers when you operate to give you

333
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,190
also a sense of how things work when I

334
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,350
did this this research you have build

335
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,510
tools you might have some of these

336
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,170
within your organization those are

337
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,180
things that automatically call maven

338
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,579
central and say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a component I</font>

339
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,640
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download it we need it for this</font>

340
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular build right there is a more</font>

341
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,359
efficient path where the development

342
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,760
teams go here to a local repository like

343
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,500
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to download</font>

344
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,809
a component instead of going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

345
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,150
central repo now they do this because

346
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:21,720
this is 10 to 20 times faster than this

347
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:24,240
just by distance right right you're

348
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,220
using a proxy it's a lot faster it's

349
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,420
sitting right next to your tools what

350
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:33,390
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so I don't want to name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names</font>

351
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,820
of organizations just throw out numbers

352
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:45,330
of how many developers your organization

353
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:49,590
has just 100 500 300 458 eight right

354
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:52,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay whatever your number was</font>

355
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:55,260
that whatever your number was that is

356
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:58,380
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people you have in software</font>

357
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,260
procurement right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

358
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of designers and people on the</font>

359
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,190
manufacturing floor it forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

360
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,960
that's how many people are in

361
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,390
procurement right they have a

362
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,610
procurement department that says we know

363
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,200
what we're sourcing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> vetted these</font>

364
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,658
components and we're bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them in</font>

365
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,000
and software development it's much

366
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:19,919
different if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 2,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,690
development you have 2,000 people in

368
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,059
software procurement that you've

369
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,549
outsourced to when you use a local

370
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:30,299
repository and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

371
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:33,840
things that make developers faster they

372
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:38,879
can also make you more secure right

373
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">right because you can't audit or trace</font>

374
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
this or even get a grasp of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless</font>

375
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,570
you're the guy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight developers</font>

376
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,179
then it's easy but if you have hundreds

377
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,309
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling 240,000 components</font>

378
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,559
across those developers you can't trace

379
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:55,289
what they're doing if everyone goes to a

380
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,059
local source here and only downloads the

381
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:01,500
new things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

382
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:03,658
have access to write think it's super

383
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,240
simple and it makes developers lives

384
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:09,960
easier and as security professionals it

385
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,570
is a huge step to being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

386
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,419
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're consuming and it</font>

387
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:20,279
doesn't cost you anything so the and I

388
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,929
don't care which product you use up

389
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,029
there even though one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was ours</font>

390
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,370
but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to get your</font>

391
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:29,610
organization to use that and developers

392
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,129
will love you for it so what percent of

393
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,740
come downloads do you think we're

394
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,770
pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> one versus pattern to in the</font>

395
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:43,490
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I saw how many people do</font>

396
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:48,220
you think are going the longest path 90

397
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:50,750
no be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty five percent anyone for a</font>

398
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,640
who would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the longest route right I</font>

399
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,190
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love strawberries</font>

400
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,050
right and I love going the field to pick

401
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,000
my strawberries once a year with the

402
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,740
kids and they love it too i pick them

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,900
they eat them right and that's totally

404
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the field</font>

405
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,450
every week or every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day that I'd like to</font>

406
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">eat strawberries but ninety-five percent</font>

407
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,730
of the time that developers want their

408
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:17,330
stuff right they go to the fields to get

409
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,880
it right and as a security organization

410
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,710
trying to protect this behavior in

411
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,230
trying to understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

412
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,440
bringing into your organization becomes

413
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:35,960
extremely difficult with that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

414
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:41,300
behavior so anybody can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it what you</font>

415
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,890
write what you have to write so what you

416
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,950
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have policies</font>

417
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,080
in place and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say look maven</font>

418
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,970
or any other build tool can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

419
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,220
just point directly the internet and get

420
00:20:49,970 --> 00:21:05,510
those components and that's kind of the

421
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">default setting of it yes yeah but if</font>

422
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull if you proxy it and pull them</font>

423
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">down you pull once and you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

424
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:20,330
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times yeah but you don't use the we</font>

425
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,940
have 1.1 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> components you don't</font>

426
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:29,510
use that many in fact you use on average

427
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:31,760
6700 right but you pull those two

428
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and forty thousand times so if</font>

429
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,830
you knew what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6700 were you never</font>

430
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull anything you'd pull one percent so</font>

431
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,110
we've seen organizations like jpmc for

432
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,940
instance they went from pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

433
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,070
million components a year to pulling

434
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,830
ninety-five thousand a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

435
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,230
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> their developers everyone has to</font>

436
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,918
point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proxy to the repository</font>

437
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,930
manager because we have a flood<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

438
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,480
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is unvetted for</font>

439
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,510
unknown sources from unknown origin and

440
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:11,570
that is a huge security risk in our

441
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:13,700
organization very little infant so this

442
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,350
sis oh this is a public story because I

443
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,530
was in New York when he was telling it

444
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,080
but the sista when we said who's the

445
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,899
largest consumer of open source

446
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,960
components from maven central at the

447
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:31,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">time right and this was many years ago</font>

448
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,240
but he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like easy IBM no microphone no</font>

449
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:38,929
federal government no<font color="#E5E5E5"> jpmc the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyst oh</font>

450
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,790
it's you three million components a year

451
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:45,290
and you know what he told<font color="#E5E5E5"> us his staff</font>

452
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:50,620
size was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that that's the</font>

453
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:56,990
answer yes 0 yeah no no one using Oh

454
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:59,239
DevOps so<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps high velocity we want</font>

455
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:01,010
to go faster and<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster we're not going</font>

456
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do two releases a year we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

457
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:08,180
do 20 releases a year a day a minute

458
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:11,690
right i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just at the devops</font>

459
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:14,780
enterprise summit I the stat that Amazon

460
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,800
is doing like 5 million releases a day

461
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:21,710
now or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it's like insane right</font>

462
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,750
so to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have an</font>

463
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source policy in place at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

465
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,830
last year with when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was presenting the</font>

469
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,040
he knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer how many</font>

470
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,780
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a policy in</font>

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:50,990
you're not allowed to use bad components

473
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:58,610
or components with bad licenses you're

474
00:23:50,990 --> 00:24:01,640
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-three percent of</font>

475
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,399
organizations said no we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that was the next question okay</font>

480
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,480
kind okay so out of those you have 57%

481
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,820
have an open source policy we're going

stuff we have it on paper that paper

485
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,620
sits right next to their their laptop

486

and they look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every time they run</font>

487
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,168

company's policy sixty-eight percent

that had a policy said that they they

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:50,000
followed it and we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked if you</font>

00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:05,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">people said yes look I know who they are</font>

496
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:08,630
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> told me yes we were breached like</font>

497
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:10,700
that list went away of who those names

498
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,429
were we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reveal the guilty</font>

499
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,770
but in the DevOps practices when

500
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,539
security comes in and says hey by the

501
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,070
way we're going to do an<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis of</font>

502
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:21,500
your applications it's going to take

503
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,629
eight hours or we'll be back to you with

504
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,669
this scan and the results in like two

505
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,490
weeks and we'll tell you what's bad or

506
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:30,169
we're doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the very end of the</font>

development life cycle before released

00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:34,429
and you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done 40 builds in</font>

509
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,408
order to to get there and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

510
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">check it the last step and then we're</font>

511
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,850
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find bad things and then we're</font>

512
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,010
going to ask you to rework those and

513
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,649
that's unplanned unscheduled work and

514
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:49,600
now I hate you and you're the guy with

fit it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get done and they don't</font>

518
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,740
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DevOps folks don't want to</font>

figure out with how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with dev ops</font>

521
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,880
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to totally change the way</font>

522
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,649
of thinking in terms of I need something

523
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually works that the same</font>

524
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:17,150
velocity that my developers are working

525
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:20,120
within within these organizations so I

526
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:23,779
did look at the download volumes that I

527
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:28,639
found as we said before 240,000

not vetting it your developers are not

538
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:12,950
is infecting your applications and I get

here's how many times you downloaded it

everyone knows to see the CBS s pattern

pages like ha so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what scared three</font>

560
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:19,969
things scared me about that right one is

561
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:24,998
the volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> two is you're a developer and</font>

562
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:24,999
you are using a component that was known

563
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:37,340
vulnerability 2003 it's 12 years old

564
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:39,260
dude they're like 83

565
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,270
you newer better less buggy more

566
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,520
functional versions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that component</font>

567
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,370
out there and you're still using the

568
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,220
same component that you used in<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

569
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:53,229
your high school you know final project

570
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:56,690
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so sixty-six percent</font>

571
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:59,690
had known vulnerabilities that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2013</font>

572
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,790
and older if there were loads of 2015's

573
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,680
that's excusable there do or we haven't

574
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:07,129
had a chance to adjust when they're

575
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,970
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> older and really old then my</font>

576
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:14,900
clicker is like super and then things

577
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:20,290
are bad if so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also looked at this</font>

578
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:23,360
pattern of there was a story quick story

579
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:28,520
there was a bank somewhere that was

580

<font color="#CCCCCC">using spring core and the joke and tide</font>

581
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,490
so no type was they had downloaded the

582
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,650
51 of 58 versions of spring core in the

583
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,650
last year so they were seven away from

584
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,000
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their development</font>

585
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:43,040
organization that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using every</font>

586
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,200
known almost every known version

587
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,210
available so i looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top hundred</font>

588
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,870
downloads of what people were consuming

589
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,240
within their organizations and within

590
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,030
those top downloads there were 27

591
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,820
versions on average of every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

592
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:03,860
their top hundred components that were

593
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:07,340
downloaded right so whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> ford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has one</font>

594
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,580

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they use right across a</font>

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,929
where maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the analogy is getting too</font>

598
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,970
wide there but you could manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

599
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:22,910
hundred different parts or you could

application security professional which

602
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:30,409
is easier to manage right<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

603
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:33,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain which is easier to</font>

a vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> or exploitable landscape</font>

606
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:44,419
for you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Land Rover doesn't use like</font>

607
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,270
27 different mufflers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their</font>

vehicles in a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> year for a specific</font>

609
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,889
reason it's easier to manage

610
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:57,030
things go flawed then they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get a</font>

611
00:30:52,890 --> 00:31:00,140
new clicker it's defective clearly

612
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:05,129
they're bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> parts or it's a bad finger</font>

613
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:08,520
so Google manages to versions of their

614
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,020
components within their organizations

615
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,240
they have a mandate across their

616
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,460
organization that says you're allowed to

617
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,130
use open source but you can only use<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

618
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:22,680
version and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need an excuse you</font>

619
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:24,660
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there is a mandate</font>

620
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,970
across their organization on what they

621
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,520
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use so that they can control their</font>

622
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,860
software supply chain and if something

<font color="#E5E5E5">goes wrong and someone says there's a</font>

624
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,629
new vulnerability in that component did

625
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,620
we use it how quickly do you think they

626
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:43,740
can answer that super quick we only use

627
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,010
to write and here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> those two we have</font>

628
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">an exact trace of what we used across</font>

629
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:53,010
all of our thousands of developers write

I was there said in his repository

manager at Capital One right they have

635
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:08,189
one version of every component that they

636
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,199
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for development they do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not allow</font>

637
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,170
multiple components in because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

638
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,300
streamlines their development process

their security process their legal

640
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,240
reviews their quality reviews that they

are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best quality part the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">latest part from the best quality</font>

643
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:29,750
projects to make sure that they keep

644
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:32,850
their environment clean so we'll look at

645
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,770
finished goods we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's bad</font>

646
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,770
stuff out there that doesn't get fixed

647
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,720
that's in a warehouse right a central

648
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,450
repository and we know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is</font>

649
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,760
downloaded to local repositories that is

650
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,640
then consumed by developers or they're

651
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pulling it directly so we have a</font>

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">free service called application health</font>

653
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:57,090
check it's similar but I'll stay better

654
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:59,699
than a wasp dependency check but use

655
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:03,330
both they're both free doesn't doesn't

656
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,970
matter the within those that

657
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:08,399
couple thousand applications that we've

658
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,450
analyzed right we found there's an

659
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:15,840
average of a hundred and six components

660
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:19,620
106 circles up there right 106

661
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,669
components and the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that 23%</font>

662
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,840
or 24 of the 106 have known

663
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,540

664
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,720

666
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,760
are vulnerable and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird thing is</font>

667
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:39,480
and for honestly we haven't figured out

668
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,530
exactly why yet but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 16</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

669
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:47,730

components vulnerable and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

672
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,120
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more research as to why the</font>

673
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,100

the release<font color="#E5E5E5"> second we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

676
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,500
year's report to see if we get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

more data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so your software supply</font>

678
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:14,100
chain is very efficient in flowing

679
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:16,679
flowing things through so software

680
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,290
supply chains with software supply

681
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,440
chains we can learn a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> from what the</font>

682
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,810
manufacturing industry has done to have

683
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,880
better quality products in safer

684
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,130
products and produce them at high

685
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,980
velocity and keep that quality and

686
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:34,410
integrity high and I think we all this

687
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,510
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> the particular article about jeeps</font>

688
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:39,000
being recalled for software recalls but

689
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,220
I think all of you heard read the wired

690
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,989
article back in August<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Jeep that</font>

691
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">was stopped on the highway with the</font>

692
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:48,179
truck coming up behind and that was you

693
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,940
know I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't the guy that was</font>

694
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,940
driving from wired I you know in that

695
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,090
scenario but you also remember that

696
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:01,020
within a week chrysler said we are

697
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:03,390
recalling three million jeeps or

698
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,210
whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this software</font>

699
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:09,299
component in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

700
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:14,010
they can tell where their software is

701
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,020
and yet the vast majority of us have no

702
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,860
policies in place to track and trace

703
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,210
what goes out

704
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,980
we're in my survey there were

705
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,810
twenty-three percent of all the

706
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,210
organizations that answered that said

707
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:27,270
we're totally locked down and we have

708
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,210
full visibility so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75% of organizations</font>

709
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't is because the auto manufacturers</font>

710
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,300
have a managed supply chain they know

711
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,580
every piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software and every</font>

712
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,680
vehicle<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every make model year so when</font>

713
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,069
they have a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there is a</font>

714
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,220
defect they can make a recall so they're

715
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:49,170
mean time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detection is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero right</font>

716
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,089
they know exactly where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is they're</font>

717
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,500
mean time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remediation is longer</font>

718
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,350
because you have to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in to the</font>

719
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,120
dealer to fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless the cars with</font>

720
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,730
Wi-Fi are going to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

721

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air but that's a whole other</font>

722
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:10,710
security issue I don't know and usually

723
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:13,290
usually it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not revealed because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

724
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,960
if it was open source and they revealed

725
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,840
it then that makes the exploit path

726
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,060
really easy to figure out did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,640
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who else use that what other</font>

728
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,450
automakers use that same part and you

can shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> three million cars across</font>

734
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,110
that you can find it the old process is

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> National vulnerability database look</font>

739
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,350
a nun occasion I'm going to look at your

740
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,780
applications and find out what's in them

741
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:01,589
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the old process that</font>

using these in your organization here is

ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at your applications</font>

769
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:19,170
and see what's in them so you have an

opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be this person or you</font>

with the development organizations and

00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,859
there are some easier ways to go about

of thinking in this higher velocity is

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:41,069
you can help developers this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

component that you picked this has

here this top row is these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

it's got the least amount of security

vulnerabilities associated with it and

789
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,339
it might meet your company policy if you

790
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,380
tell a developer as early as possible in

that vulnerability the rest of the

797
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,500
development life cycle goes a lot

798
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,810
smoother the amount of rework is less

799
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,849
your vulnerability checks even if

00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're at the end of the process will</font>

801
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:43,610
get better because there's less chance

802
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:49,070
for that component to go bad over

803
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:51,020
sorry I'm going to get a new thumb if

804

you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins builds or bamboo or</font>

806
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:58,190
those platforms that say the build was

00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:00,680
stable not stable what have you but

808
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:02,750
every single build can tell you how many

809
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,879
components were in it were there any

810

security risk or vulnerabilities within

811
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,590
those components and you can set

812
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,900
policies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say alert someone inform</font>

813

someone so the developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better</font>

choice that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make or even if you</font>

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,319
get the report you will get these slides

844
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,230
you will get the survey from last year

853
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:09,859
works with me on this activity to get

854
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,289
people slides at the end which is cool

855
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,700
it from Jean Kim because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

856
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:15,529
a cool idea because everyone always

857
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,419
wants the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides and next week when you</font>

858
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:18,980
think i need those where do I get them

859

upload them blah you have them but Mark

861
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:28,999
had 30 people request all at once and

862
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,769
but he had a room like 500 so if I can

00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:35,450
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you then I can go back to</font>

00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:48,140
you guys all might know the link for

869
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:50,209
that article it's called almost too big

870
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,640
to fail if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google search that</font>

871
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:55,400
but the link is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides is well</font>

872
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,170
that article provides there it's a four

873
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,269
or five page analysis where they walk

874
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">through what did we look at how did we</font>

875
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:05,720
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it and the method behind it but</font>

876
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,880
yeah it was there you know we at

877
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,069
sonatype we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we've known</font>

878
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,559
that for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font>

879
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:14,150
of dogma out there that says look there

880
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">are lots of people working on this but</font>

881
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,720
then like things came up last year like

882
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,549
heartbleed and they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well there's</font>

883
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,759
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> like two people kind of working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

884
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:25,369
that project well and they're not you

885
00:43:22,759 --> 00:43:27,170
know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most of projects out there</font>

886
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:29,900
where you might have hundreds of

887
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,420
developers or contributors on those how

888
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,190
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> are security professionals how many</font>

889
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,650
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually trained to look for stuff</font>

890
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,710
that might be known flaws and then how

891
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,109
many security

892
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:43,430
think about in Java alone there's a

893
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:45,930
million project a million projects are

894
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,700
115,000 projects how many applications

895
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:58,980
security professionals are there in the

896
00:43:47,700 --> 00:44:02,480
world right yeah yes we would love no

897
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,700
and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out a way to</font>

898
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,390
inform those projects like hey your

899
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:12,299
stuff has been known bad for years and

900
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,920
there are alternatives out there to some

901
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those dependencies you might rely</font>

902
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:21,410
upon so ford ford motor company does not

903
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">make their brakes they get them from</font>

904
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">delco right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about</font>

905
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,960
auto manufacturers even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

906
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:30,330
cars in my slides so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say they get</font>

907
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:37,140
them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> delco right and the brakes are</font>

908
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:40,680
bad right do we sue delco know right we

909
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,670
sue who<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bought the car from Ford I go</font>

910
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:46,919
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> them right so the liability is you</font>

911
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:49,800
have as application security the good

912
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,530
thing is with components and packages

913
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,390
that are being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> their identifiable</font>

914
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,369
trackable traceable they're the same

915
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,750
everywhere they're used they're easy to

916
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:03,180
find custom code isn't it was incredibly

917
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,760
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find these things in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

918
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,919
past now that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the same we</font>

919
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,200
know everyone that used that version of

920
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">that component is the same everywhere</font>

921
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,430
and if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vulnerable one place and</font>

922
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:20,960
that circumstance is vulnerable

923
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:24,569
everywhere in that same circumstance yes

924
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:30,150
yes but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to realize like think</font>

925
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:32,970
about right think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about any industry</font>

926
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,780
pick any product<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you love right</font>

927
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:39,118
that you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty three percent of the</font>

928
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,339
manufactured part in there are defective

929
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:46,280
or known vulnerable or putting you at

930
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:48,900
risk right the I said at the beginning

931
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,269
application development has changed in

932
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,219
security processes haven't

933
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:55,618
changed enough we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a way the</font>

934
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:58,259
velocity the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumption is not going to</font>

935
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,939
slow down we've had organization that

936
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,709
when we told them their consumption they

937
00:45:59,939 --> 00:46:03,839
said we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an easy solution we're</font>

938
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:06,629
just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using open source</font>

939
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,069
components so the developers all say

940
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,769
great we're quitting how are you going

941
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,989
to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in business because that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

942
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:15,629
going to happen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

943
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get any less so what what i can tell</font>

944
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:21,839
you whoever you are big or small

945
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,078
whatever country you live in whatever

946
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,719
application you're developing on one in

947
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:52,709
16 of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your components that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you download</font>

948
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:55,319
is known vulnerability good at this now

949
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:58,078
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would tell you the vast majority</font>

950
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:00,449
are around the average we see

951
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,549
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> where seventeen percent of</font>

952
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:05,759
what they're pulling down compared to

953
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:07,049
the 6.2<font color="#CCCCCC"> two percent average seventeen</font>

954
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:12,179
percent of the things they're pulling

955
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:16,439
down are known vulnerability like<font color="#CCCCCC"> super</font>

956
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:20,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad but no one's immune from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

957
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:22,499
at hand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm around at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sonatype</font>

958
00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:25,439
booth of you guys that have more

959
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:30,019
questions happy to answer and thank you

960
