1
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,849
I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start off today this is</font>

2
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,619
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a talk about security but</font>

3
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:27,210
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it from a slightly</font>

4
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,059
different perspective it will be

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,079
technical a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but I'm talking</font>

6
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:36,180
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an overall objective now as</font>

7
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,620
before I got into the information

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,629
security space I was a software

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,780
developer i wrote kernel code device

10
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,280
drivers a number of applications for a

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,290
variety of operating systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> including</font>

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,070
the unix space and this was even before

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,010
linux my work started off in NASA at

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,850
Cape Canaveral and it was there where I

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,230
really got an<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding of what</font>

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,539
software development or secure software

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,608
development really means and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think about secure software</font>

19
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,890
development simply a sanitization or

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,929
preventing buffer overflows or some

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,520
context like that but it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion</font>

22
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:22,560
it's actually a larger issue in in the

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept of true risk management from a</font>

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,259
software perspective your code the code

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you wrote today and that it's just</font>

26
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,140
went out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> production if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

27
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">from Cote five years from now it's going</font>

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,869
to be most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a completely different</font>

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,520
animal now take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the ipad for</font>

30
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,829
example back when it was released i

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,048
think in 2007 there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> as all this</font>

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,179
chatter that Steve Jobs did not want a

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,430
stylist he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to use a stylus</font>

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,930
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that what did that will do</font>

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">today they made a stylus and it became a</font>

36
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:59,909
controversial issue in reality though

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,189
Apple released it because their

38
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,710
customers were saying or<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially the</font>

39
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,369
artists we would love to have a stylist

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,709
to draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it customers use the iPad in</font>

41
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,350
ways that even Apple didn't dream so

42
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,859
Apple decided to satisfy their customer

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,560
needs and implement a solution they saw

44
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:20,940
a market they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of it now</font>

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,670
that's great from a business perspective

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,500
you're in software development you've

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,679
got to worry about the code you write

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,140
and that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be changed over</font>

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,810
time so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

50
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,260
have the foresight to know that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

51
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,350
unexpected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to be able to make the</font>

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,060
appropriate changes without breaking

53
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,250
your back or breaking your company or

54
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,069
causing so much havoc and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">use an actual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example from my personal</font>

56
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,420
experience so let's start off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

57
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">design the concept of flexibility in</font>

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,570
this context and it just simply means to

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,520
be able to modify code within a

60
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,209
reasonable perspective to maintain a

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,660
secure state now in older versions it

62
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,730
was more quality but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,980
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today about buffer</font>

64
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,200
overflows or cross-site scripting or

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,780
anything like that the fact is you've

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,760
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write code today as I showed you</font>

67
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,410
in that previous page that what you

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to expect five years from</font>

69
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,060
now is almost completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,440
there are a number outside influences on

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:40,350
this there could be excuse me got to go

72
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:42,930
back jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gun on that you can have</font>

73
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,320
customer requirements you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,209
competition you can have regulatory

75
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,670
issues such as PCI if you've ever

76
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,680
written software that is for pc i use

77
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that pci changes their</font>

78
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,019
requirements and auditors often change

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,579
their requirements within the pci space

80
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,049
so you've got to have the foresight to

81
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,880
expect what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm writing now is not going</font>

82
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,709
to be acceptable five years from now

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,220
I've got to be a little willing to make

84
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,858
changes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have competition that might</font>

85
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,500
make bet code better than you and more

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,390
gave a great presentation on two-factor

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,450
authentication especially like through

92
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:36,270
biomedics you write code today because

93
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,719
your boss wants fingerprint

94
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,020
authentication in comes clear into your

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,390
business now if I saw clear walking into

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,400
my office or my comp

97
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,229
x it all depends on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the situation</font>

98
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,630
is if she's professionally dressed and

99
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,730
talk to my CEO guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

aren't you doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,960
more casually<font color="#E5E5E5"> dressed wearing jeans and</font>

108
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,940
for good reasons and as the old saying

109
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,190
goes Claire's Claire's opinions on

110
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,560
authentication carry a lot of weight

111
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">around here I just carry a lot of weight</font>

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,660
period<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's now that we have</font>

113
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,450
that so let's say for example you have

114
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,920
to worry about authentication Claire

115
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,950
comes in and tells your boss you're

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,130
doing it all wrong guess who your boss

117
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:38,700
is going to see next<font color="#E5E5E5"> and guess what he's</font>

118
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:41,370
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to demand so if you have in the</font>

119
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,920
initial design thought about that

120
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,690
anticipation and thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

121

concept you're going to be changing your

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,990
coat over time it can make make a

123
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,690
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between doing it right and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">maintaining a secure state or rushing it</font>

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,490
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very beginning and doing it</font>

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,440
wrong which turns out to be a major

128
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,800
hassle<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a couple examples</font>

129
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,010
you know SSL is being phased out well

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,700
somebody has to use SSL or somebody used

131
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,920
to use SSL now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to LS and now</font>

132
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pci requirement anymore</font>

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,490
if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL in your code you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

137
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:38,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it TLS is the same thing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

but what there's one other factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

140
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,159

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,460
a lot of developers make the mistake of

not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding what their work</font>

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,750
you can write code better than your

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,780

<font color="#CCCCCC">have the metrics to show it or at least</font>

153
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,040

of you in here are vying for the same

163
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,400

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the concept of</font>

174
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,670
flexibility as the way it works into

security it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really works very well and</font>

may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like it from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font>

177
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:22,900
beginning fact is going to be extra work

in the very in the beginning but<font color="#CCCCCC"> study</font>

179
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:30,669
after study after study after study have

180
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,950
all concluded the same thing if you

181
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:36,370
design it right from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very beginning</font>

182
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,880
it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most hassle at the start</font>

183
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,600
but over time it is easier to implement

184
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,670
easier to change your boss is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

scream at you probably why you aren't

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,790
so long but that very same boss if you

188
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,070
have to make any changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,030
why isn't it why<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't the change has</font>

191
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">been implemented yet so you as a</font>

get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security space it's more</font>

194
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,550
than just thinking a buffer overflows or

195
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,930
anything like that you've got to look

196
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,349
long term plan ahead think about what

197
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,589
she

198
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,720
just can be made and how you can design

199
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">your architecture so that those changes</font>

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,480
can be easily implemented if you look at

201
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">architecture from any other perspective</font>

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,720
in the physical world whether it's

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,610
airline structures like bridges or

204
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,760
towers or anything even ships any good

205
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:39,430
engineer has the concept to understand

206
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,069
that that structure that he or she

207
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,699
builds is going to be subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

208
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,730
due to nature's effects skyscrapers do

209
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,280
not believe it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not are not that rigid</font>

210
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,250
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> bend with the wind you may not tell</font>

211
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,069
it but they do because a good engineer

212
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,210
knows that they could only resist

213
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,040
outside changes so much bridges will be

214
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:06,040
built with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anticipation that the</font>

215
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,520
ground below it will change so they

216
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,770
design it with that change in mind there

217
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,199
was a article may be about 10 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

218
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,819
an engineer was flying with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven year</font>

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">old son and they were experiencing some</font>

modern some mediate medium turbulence

223
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,640
because they were bouncing like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

the turbulence<font color="#CCCCCC"> thatthat said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no you</font>

they're not fighting against nature it's

227
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,610
bending along with it and because it's

228
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,940
flexible and not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> aluminum is so</font>

low density it is able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjust</font>

230
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,460
accordingly rather snap off it's able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

adjust with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with the current</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">environment and go on that's one of the</font>

233
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,260
reasons why the Titanic growth because

234
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,600
the the meta was so rigid and so

235
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,030
inflexible the weight just eventually

236
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,070
sheared<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ship off when you take a</font>

237
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,490
twig for example a healthy young twig

238
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,270
you bend it it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be flexible when you</font>

239
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,770
take an old tweak it breaks same concept

240
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of advantages to</font>

241
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,400
flexibility but there are some

242
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,270
disadvantages and I've listed some of

243
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">them here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you will impact your</font>

244
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,980
performance a little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

245
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">that much as it much as it used to be in</font>

246
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,300
other words because of processing speed

247
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,050
and compiler

248
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,579
it has reduced somewhat your until

249
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,469
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of your integrity</font>

250
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,180
because you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to have</font>

251
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,700
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your internal structure or</font>

252
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,279
your eternal data elements as you go

253
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,579
along so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that into</font>

254
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
consideration so there are there are

255
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">general there are some general</font>

256
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,510
disadvantages but overall if you plan it

257
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:50,680
if you plan it well you can put

258
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you can design something</font>

259
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,630
really well so that when your boss comes

260
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,700
to you say we makes we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

261
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,070
change you can make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jan I'm not</font>

262
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,990
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minor change I'm talking</font>

263
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,110
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comprehensive major change which</font>

264
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,970
I will show in a moment now the concept

265
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,910
of flexibility is not new it was

266
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually thought about back in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1977 and</font>

267
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,649
I have references at the end of this

268
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,850
talk and this will be available to the

269
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:20,760
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was from Griffith</font>

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,279
Air Force Base and General Electric

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,050
where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to improve the quality</font>

272
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,870
of their software development in the

273
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,870
military flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of the top</font>

274
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:36,220
eleven out of 55 requirements for their

275
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,950
design and flexibility breaks down even

276
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:44,380
to further as such as accessibility

277
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:46,300
adaptability and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok flexibility</font>

278
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,350
is not just whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can expand your</font>

279
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,569
buffer to accept the larger string but

280
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,579
your customer is using your software

281
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,380
right now what are you designing in it

282
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,500
so that if you have to make a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

283
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:01,899
expand that buffer what are you doing so

284
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,209
that it doesn't impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer are</font>

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,459
you designing in a way so that if you

286
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:09,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">think if I have to increase that buffer</font>

287
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:11,560
size is my cut is it going to impact my

customer have to do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the change</font>

290
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,399
so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of something like</font>

291
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think of</font>

292
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,790
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

293
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,120
unfortunately in my opinion software

294
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,640
engineering is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming a lost art I</font>

295
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,490
attended a threat analysis class at

296
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">black cat last year and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was the only</font>

297
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,660
one over 35 and they were including

298
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,180
three software developers and none of

299
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,589
them could do reverse engineering none

300
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them could reassemble</font>

301
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:43,240
or none of them could even understand

302
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,920
the basic concept of the stack none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

303
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,250
them even had a basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding of</font>

304
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,020
what registers do if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

305
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,720
a good software engineer and really

306
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,939
excel unique just like any other

307
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,490
engineer has to understand the

308
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,230
environment which he or she works on if

309
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,110
you're building a bridge if you're

310
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with high-level water or high</font>

311
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,050
velocity water<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to think about</font>

312
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,000
that if you're building an airplane

313
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,790
you've got to think about the stress

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,950
factors involved so for engineering is

315
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,810
becoming nothing more than just a

316
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,380
buzzword I'm a software engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write</font>

317
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,319
java and PHP whoopty freaking do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

318
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,350
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write an assembler I had a</font>

319
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,930
debugging assembler and I hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the</font>

320
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,480
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you really understand the</font>

321
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,890
architecture if you don't know they

322
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,240
architecture which you're building on

323
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,220
fine that's one thing but don't call

324
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,560
yourself a software engineer your

325
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,570
program you may be good at what you do

326
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,920
but if you're going to go into device

327
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,540
drivers if you're going to go into

328
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,880
kernels if you're going to go into low

329
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,300
level security if you want to reverse

330
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,680
engineer you've got to understand it

331
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,089
because whatever you write I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can break I</font>

332
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,449
can go in with a kernel debugger and

333
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:59,080
modify your code change values and make

334
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,570
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Whitworth the way I want so you've</font>

335
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,220
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about that and we need</font>

336
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,240
these type of people we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need</font>

337
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,860
PHP program against PHP or java but we

338
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,800
need people really understand the

339
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,320
architecture I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of crappy</font>

340
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,709
code by so-called programmers who write

341
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,020
it in this static<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewpoint but when</font>

342
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">things have to change it all becomes a</font>

343
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,870
major undertaking and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

344
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,570
break the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper that I just talked</font>

345
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,800
about it's just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> every other report</font>

346
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:35,740
the longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wait to really implement</font>

347
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,099
good software design be<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible enough</font>

348
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:43,180
a change the more expensive it becomes

349
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,900
over time doing it the from the very

350
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:49,380
beginning is best but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

351
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,120
run into a lot of business resistance

352
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,710
you're going to want your boss to your

353
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,990
boss is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first on</font>

354
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market the next boss who tells me</font>

355
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be first I swear I'm</font>

356
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,620
gonna hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I mean it I am sick and</font>

357
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,710
title we want to be first on the market

358
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:09,490
so what how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times have you probably</font>

359
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard of an of a news article that we're</font>

360
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:16,540
refers to report it yeah they were all

361
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is your objective to satisfy</font>

362
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,920
your customer needs to be secure or is

363
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,600
the first to say you were first on the

364
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,449
market great you were first on the

365
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,690
market but your coat sucks I broke it

366
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,380
everybody broke breaks it and now it's

367
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the wall of shame in every hacking</font>

368
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:38,529
website known to man okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

369
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,720
first is not always best another concept

370
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:42,880
will sell it now and we'll fix it later

371
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,550
a lot of managers make the mistake of

372
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,230
architecture being something like I will

373
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,750
just flip the switch later okay why

374
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,839
don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just flip the switch now when</font>

375
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,640
you build a house you design your

376
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,560
windows you design your electrical

377
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,120
systems you design your lighting while

378
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,670
it's on the paper with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your architect</font>

379
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't build a eighty percent done</font>

380
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,790
and then say oh I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change this I</font>

381
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:07,230
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change this I want to change</font>

382
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you're our protector will hit you</font>

383
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,620
why because there are stress factors

384
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,980
involved in building a house you've

385
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,958
designed it on paper and then build it

386
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,660
same thing with software design it's no

387
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,209
different the processes may be different

388
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,270
but you've got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the same</font>

389
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:27,130
general concept a lot of managers think

390
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,350
we'll flip a switch will that change a

391
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,330
value and is done the very first

392
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">question I asked that boss do it now</font>

393
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,610
what's the big deal and they later find

394
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,400
out it's not as easy as it sounds

395
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:41,979
they're quick they want to be out we'll

396
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,460
fix it later but think about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

397
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,530
your help desk will have higher costs it

398
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,780
will probably cost more to implement

399
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,149
good software development in the longer

400
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,550
run when os/2 was released and I'm going

401
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,370
to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS to in a minute IBM had a</font>

402
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,740
higher a lot of help desk people and how

403
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,199
to get software developers to do a lot

404
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help desk including me because it</font>

405
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,410
had so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much problems in the beginning</font>

406
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,659
same thing with your code you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

407
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:13,600
it's great they were first on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

408
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're out but there are impacts your</font>

409
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,389
don't want angry customers calling you

410
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,400
limited budgets if you write so if

411
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,520
you're releasing a product that's Pete

412
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,170
for pci or HIPAA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Claire</font>

413
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,639
knows what hip what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

414
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:33,220
HIPAA is if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not right or if it's</font>

415
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,710
poorly made the regulators are going to

416
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,920
be coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> after you and you do not want</font>

417
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:42,520
that trust me on that you do not want

418
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,230
them your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to your you</font>

419
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,210
may have a bunch of risk that you

420
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,820
understand what are going on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

421
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,650
code your business however has four

422
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,290
general types of business risk and I've

423
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,070
listed them all there if you need to

424
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:59,170
communicate an issue to your boss you

425
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,090
can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about technology all day he's</font>

426
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,120
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care he wants one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,570
four types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk that's going to</font>

428
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,840
impact him if you can address why you

429
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,120
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a better job and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can</font>

430
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,129
address one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these four issues you</font>

431
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,350
have are more likely going to get your

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,830
don't even bother talking about tech now

434
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,600
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to care they want to they</font>

customers in order to get money you need

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,690
a paycheck don't you and don't tell me

438
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure software</font>

does not sell products and services do

441
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,930
so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

442
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,540
you're so if you're if you sell security

and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation is impacted or your</font>

444
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,680

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,100
boss is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start seeing your point</font>

446
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,840
of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's now I was talking</font>

447
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the architecture I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a</font>

448
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,780
little bit about what it's been like in

449
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past and there's a reason for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

450
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,220
obviously I'm going to you can see the

451
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">table on here of the microbe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's poor</font>

452
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,710
for each microprocessor in the old days

453
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,360
a mile<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going back I'm dating myself</font>

454
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,850
but we used to have to deal with near

455
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,449
and far pointers and that type

456
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:20,219
for complex mathematical operations we

457
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,990
had to go into special assembler

458
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,020
routines in order to do that because

459
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the 16-bit architecture alone just</font>

460
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,510
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have the capability so when you</font>

461
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are writing your code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may think</font>

462
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,860
ok we're fine it's running<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine we don't</font>

463
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,530
have any problems now when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it was</font>

464
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,850
to the original one point 0 version of

465
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">OS to was 16 bit now we're going to two</font>

466
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,830
point O an IBM to say hey we've got

467
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,100
these new machines let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

468
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,110
32-bit oh that sounds great except that

469
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">there were a lot of there was a lot of</font>

470
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,780
impact from the 32-bit perspective and I

471
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,820
have one example for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a lot of</font>

472
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,649
developers used to write if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

473
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,540
start off with negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 even if it's</font>

474
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:10,020
an unsigned integer in c you can do ffff

475
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,690
that's fine but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens from the 16</font>

476
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,900
to the 32-bit look what happens because

477
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:19,220
an integer is implementation dependent

478
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,990
it is not a fixed 16-bit value it

479
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,270
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the microprocessor so if</font>

480
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:30,030
you have of ffff this is what it becomes

481
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,280
it is now a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> value but if you</font>

482
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,460
maintain the minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 the unsigned</font>

483
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,190
integer minus 1 it changes and changes

484
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,380
and when it goes eventually to 128 bit

485
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,810
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> change as well because a</font>

486
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,850
compiler they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> smarter not even in the</font>

487
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,190
old compilers they will automatically

488
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,169
change if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it the old-fashioned</font>

489
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,300
way you have to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code now</font>

490
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,090
and make changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you did it this way</font>

491
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,310
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an unsigned integer you know to</font>

492
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,800
worry about it you just saved yourself

493
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,669
some time you had major code a little

494
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more secure and your boss may be a</font>

495
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,820
little bit happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out it took you</font>

496
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,560
days rather than weeks to make the

497
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,169
change this is what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

498
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,810
this is just the beginning we're talking

499
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">about pointers we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking where you</font>

500
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:18,780
can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> between a ski and unicode</font>

501
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:21,000
you're talking we're rather than strict

502
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">ascii strings what about you need coach</font>

503
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,840
strings you're going more international

504
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,150
you got to worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you may</font>

505
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,530
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I write in Java whoopty</font>

506
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,020
freaking do again

507
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,690
used to write the Java Runtime compiler

508
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,600
in the AIX operating system that was

509
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">written in C and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am surprised we had</font>

510
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,000
it running because<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if the AIX</font>

511
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,820
operating system change it could impact

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,220
the Java Runtime environment so don't

513
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,879
think because you run<font color="#CCCCCC"> java you're secure</font>

514
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,830
you're safe everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine no you're</font>

515
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,780
running java on top of another<font color="#E5E5E5"> library</font>

516
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,600
which is running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of your</font>

517
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:03,540
operating system and that operate that

518
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:06,780
library runs c and assembler and java or

519
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:10,889
excuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> me AIX is not an intel based</font>

520
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:12,899
system it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a power based system which</font>

521
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,540
uses an entirely different architectures

522
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,520
not just for regit for general purpose

523
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,440
registers we're talking like 16 general

524
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,900
purpose registers it's an entirely

525
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,730
different animal altogether<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple used</font>

526
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,740
to be a power environment they moved

527
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:29,400
over to an Intel<font color="#CCCCCC"> evalu that was a</font>

528
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,050
complex long and costly change which

529
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,090
impacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple but they eventually got</font>

530
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,320
it right so as you probably notice I'm

531
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,360
going to be talking about it was to a

532
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,310
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I worked on the os/2</font>

533
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,110
operating system for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of years</font>

534
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,690
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the 10 days and</font>

535
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,790
I'm going to go over one specific

536
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,000
component that I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with us too</font>

537
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:52,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was from 102 from from 10 to</font>

538
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,290
two point oh and later to 2.1 now this

539
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:58,290
does not impact security per se but this

540
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,440
does impact data integrity and this was

541
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> os/2 postscript driver what you're</font>

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at on the screen is a visual</font>

543
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,150
representation of what the old OS to

544
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,610
postscript driver day we supported

545
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,890
printers that's it we did it we did our

546
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,540
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we print a duplex or use</font>

547
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,840
color fit supported that type of thing

548
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,780
no big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal so we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little but there</font>

549
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,149
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a problem number one</font>

550
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,350
we had to go to 32 bit so we had to fix

551
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,930
all that first and that was a

552
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:31,230
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> mess because a lot of the</font>

553
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,790
coders weren't thinking long term they

554
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,350
were just thinking very short term if I

555
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed what negative 1 and believe it or</font>

556
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:40,830
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 can be a valid value if you're</font>

557
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with age 0 can be a newborn that</font>

558
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,580
is a valid age

559
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,670
so you might want to use negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> one as</font>

560
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:52,320
an uninitialized value so what was

561
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:53,940
happening was aside from IBM printer

562
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,139
manufacturers were coming out with these

563
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,160
brand-new gigantic multifunction

564
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,090
multipower printers that could do

565
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything except make coffee and so at</font>

566
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that time when I was working on the OS</font>

567
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,400
to postscript driver my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind manager and</font>

568
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,260
his leader said run simple rule if

569
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,200
you're not backward compatible with

570
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,940
those 2.1<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh don't bother coming in to</font>

571
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,720
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you've got to be backward</font>

572
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,420
compatible this was the old version then

573
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,270
what was happening is that was prime

574
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,520
directive number one prime directive

575
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,780
number two is Louis this was at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

576
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,830
when os/2 was going directly

577
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,770
head-to-head with Microsoft remember NT

578
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,480
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> too wanted to compete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

579
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,879
Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> head-to-head and prime</font>

580
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,280
directive number two is make os/2 as

581
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,900
usable and flexible and powerful as

582
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,309
possible so that as many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people can buy</font>

583
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,200
it as a while so what was happening I

584
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:55,620
have management<font color="#E5E5E5"> here telling me one</font>

585
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,530
thing I have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> os/2 vendors like the</font>

586
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:04,080
printers telling me another and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

587
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:06,090
of caught between and I think I screamed

588
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,530
a lot like that I have the sound turn

589
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,059
off but I think I screamed a lot like

590
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that during my development days okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

591
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:15,300
actually had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the printer</font>

592
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,110
manufacturers to come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me out</font>

593
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,550
going to IBM management to say if that

594
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,740
they wanted this feature and they

595
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,149
threatened OS they threaten IBM saying

596
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,940
if you do not add these new features

597
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,940
we're dropping you in other words exit

598
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,300
now think about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second you're</font>

599
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,190
you you've written this code and you

600
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:39,030
have these current security features

601
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:41,190
let's say ssl but now everybody's saying

602
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,399
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two btls and if you don't</font>

603
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:46,080
implement TLS we're dropping you now you

604
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,760
can say wait a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

605
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,730
we're fine as it is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

606
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,040
a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal no you need your customers</font>

607
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:56,010
for support so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to do</font>

608
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the change quite easily well</font>

609
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,450
in this case it wasn't easy it was

610
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,699
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> no correct it was extremely</font>

611
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,630
difficult because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to maintain the</font>

612
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">backward compatibility for 10 I had it</font>

613
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:12,410
before compatible with these new

614
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:19,200
printers and to make things even worse

615
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:23,690
some person in IBM decided to let some

616
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,070
vendors allow them to directly modify

617
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,500
specific printer features by themselves

618
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,110
like aldus pagemaker so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a focus on</font>

619
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,240
that as well and then to make things a

620
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:38,189
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better I was moving from Boca</font>

621
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,530
Raton<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and so thanks to this</font>

622
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,300
I missed a great fishing trip and I

623
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,770
missed a great shrimping expedition

624
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,250
because I really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

625
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:49,379
i got to mobile so here was the new one

626
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:53,400
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally came out very</font>

627
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,200
complicated it took there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

628
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,960
failures there were times I didn't think

629
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,810
it was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work this page right</font>

630
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,910
here would change with each printer

631
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,220
manufacturer we finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it to a way</font>

632
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:08,640
where everybody was happy if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

633
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:13,410
manage it ourselves the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment</font>

634
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:16,560
would grow exponentially imagine 255

635
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,840
printers each with four or five of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

636
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,520
own features and maybe a later version

637
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,179
could add another<font color="#E5E5E5"> four or five features</font>

638
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,310
do the math you'll see what I mean what

639
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,440
we did here is we let the printer

640
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:31,710
manufacturers you just make a selection

641
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,180
you don't care what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> printer</font>

642
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,210
manufacturer will send the appropriate

643
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,660
come hand and in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things a</font>

644
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:44,990
little bit worse you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

645
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:49,230
but skips the the last one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be</font>

646
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:51,330
something like what you want duplex but

647
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,490
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a transparency you</font>

648
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,909
don't want duplex with a transparency so

649
00:28:53,490 --> 00:29:00,300
you have to turn this off so we have to

650
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:03,360
add that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into now that in all reality</font>

651
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,669
this was not IBM's fault seriously

652
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,590
because when they originally designed it

653
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,570
they never anticipated this to happen

654
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,779
they just anticipated we just want to

655
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,389
make

656
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,820
simple print driver it was the printer

657
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:17,849
manufacturers who had all these new they

658
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,009
had their own ideas they wanted their

659
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,859
own support the bankers wanted the old

660
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:24,779
version of OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed in my</font>

661
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous life you can see all these</font>

662
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:30,119
outside forces that are coming in and

663
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:32,820
stepping on you and telling you we we

664
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:36,478
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want it now</font>

665
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:40,349
and guess who your boss is coming too so

666
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:43,830
what do you do as far as thinking from a

667
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:46,229
more flexible and more encapsulated

668
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:50,279
perspective thinking about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

669
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:52,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">term well going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the standard section</font>

670
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,239
it's obviously designed a framework and

671
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,129
you can use something like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> July</font>

672
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:58,289
methodology now some companies still use

673
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,580
waterfall more companies are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

674
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:00,950
add jalen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go a little bit</font>

675
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">more into agile in a minute</font>

676
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:07,289
encapsulation is important encapsulation

677
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,149
is not only great from a object-oriented

678
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:11,039
perspective but it's also great from a

679
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:13,129
seed perspective you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do good</font>

680
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,299
encapsulation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sea perspective</font>

681
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:17,998
minimizing your global variables because

your customers your customers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

something we're saying I know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to make changes so what do I</font>

689
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,509
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do from the very beginning to</font>

690
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,029
permit those changes I don't know what

691
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:38,700
those changes are but is there something

692
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:41,729
that I can do that makes those changes

693
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,589
possible in the in the almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> to example</font>

694
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:47,399
what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was use a very primitive</font>

695
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:50,969
version of XML I allowed multiple

696
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:54,089
selections various multiple data links

697
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:56,519
and send it across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and i</font>

698
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:59,099
also updated the old version<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to</font>

699
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,289
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that both were working fine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

700
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:03,389
even as these new printers grew it

701
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,549
didn't make any difference it was

702
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:07,468
flexible enough where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

703
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:09,299
the new feature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted and it</font>

704
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:11,389
would just work as is and we would grow

705
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:14,009
the buffer accordingly it was a very

706
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">tedious complicated procedure but it</font>

707
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:20,070
finally got to work you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

708
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:21,988
rely on polymorphism on common

709
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:23,309
interfaces a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think well</font>

710
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,870
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to rely</font>

711
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,149
on this interface for this in this

712
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:29,070
interface for that what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did with os/2</font>

713
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,899
is we relied on one common interface for

714
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,639
all the drivers we actually simplified

715
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,018
things and if you were a printer

716
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,879
manufacturer you want to add your own

717
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:38,399
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> features we enabled that very</font>

718
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:40,379
easily by designing that in from the

719
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,498
very beginning it became so easy for

720
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:46,759
people to meant to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> new features HP</font>

721
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:49,679
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a special color support</font>

722
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:52,710
tektronix wanted their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own unique</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

723
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,470
handling their output and we were able

724
00:31:52,710 --> 00:32:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give it to them now again this is not</font>

725
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:03,389
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a security per se was more</font>

726
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,549
of integrity but you can see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

727
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:07,168
that when all these outside forces come

728
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,269
in and expect you to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

729
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:11,190
you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ready for those changes</font>

730
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,960
if Claire comes walking in your door he

731
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:17,100
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> your two-factor authentication is</font>

732
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,409
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and you're using RSA how easy it</font>

733
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,498
is for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move to the gemalto model</font>

734
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,169
of two factor authentication your boss

735
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:28,649
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to want it now no he wants it</font>

736
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:31,769
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he wants it cheap and he</font>

737
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:33,539
wants it done professionally I mean and

738
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,909
he's going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you everything you've</font>

739
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:37,289
got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you design</font>

740
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:39,929
it right from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very beginning saying</font>

741
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:43,049
knowing full well I might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

742
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:46,769
this so what do I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

743
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:48,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">portable and encapsulated be modular so</font>

744
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:53,100
that I can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from point A to</font>

745
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:55,200
point B this may seem obvious to most of

746
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,990
you but believe it or not I come up to

747
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,970
this a lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot especially with the</font>

748
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,860
younger developers they create something

749
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,230
and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother to initialize it</font>

750
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,740
or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't bother to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set default</font>

751
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,240
values and then like right up here in

752
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,119
the third bullet point setting all their

753
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,029
variables to a non defined or not not to

754
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,769
you stay I come across<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot they</font>

755
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:19,440
define something and they forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

756
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:22,289
initialize it appropriately both in

757
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,799
creating and removing now let's let's

758
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:28,019
make one point clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go in and</font>

759
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,639
modify anybody's code here I can go in

760
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify the colonel I can go in and</font>

761
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,590
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things there's only so much</font>

762
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,029
you can do well the one mistake a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

763
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,899
software developers make they think that

764
00:33:36,029 --> 00:33:38,369
attackers are

765
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,018
all experts they think they're all

766
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:42,330
godlike and they can do all these

767
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,960
wonderful things a lot of attackers are

768
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:48,269
idiots okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smart enough to</font>

769
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,820
modify your fingerprint but it doesn't

770
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,440
take a rocket scientist to see what you

771
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,609
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four-digit code as</font>

772
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,940
you were entering in the phone the phone

773
00:33:53,609 --> 00:33:58,918
I was in Singapore one time and I had

774
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,769
lost count because every single time

775
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:05,249
when I would go on the train to work and

776
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:06,899
from work I caught no less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

777
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:09,750
people entering their four-digit

778
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:11,308
passcode in front of me I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need I</font>

779
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">can just steal their phone I don't need</font>

780
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:14,730
any technical expertise I<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal your</font>

781
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,450
phone I remember your four-digit

782
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:20,730
passcode I'm in so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need so when a</font>

783
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,828
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people often forget that part</font>

784
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,510
they they set very they forget to

785
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:26,609
initialize variables at the very

786
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:29,129
beginning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they forget to reset it to</font>

787
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:31,199
a non you state at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end that's</font>

788
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,359
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when you free memory</font>

789
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,908
if you're freeing you from the heap

790
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,619
that's out of your control now but it's

791
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,210
not out of the operating systems control

792
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:43,139
it's not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else's control</font>

793
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:45,240
it is just out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your control when you</font>

794
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,339
use it you have to verify all data

795
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:50,578
before modifications one person told me

796
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,529
I had a great idea in a see you in a sea

797
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:54,539
program you can write you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font>

798
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:58,410
hash value for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data structures that</font>

799
00:34:54,539 --> 00:35:00,480
are not modifiable that's an idea or you

800
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,940
can define everything as private by

801
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,670
default and then go to a less secure

802
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,109
state as you're using it that's

803
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,760
important that's more from a

804
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:11,430
psychological perspective because if

805
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,390
you'd if we have a tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think i'm</font>

806
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:17,970
going to define X as an integer but what

807
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you define a private value of x as an</font>

808
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,799
integer and that goes with your mindset

809
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:25,980
it is easier to go from a secure state

810
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:28,770
to a non-secure state than vice versa

811
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,819
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a less to a more</font>

812
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,529
secure state you're going to forget

813
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you're going to make mistakes</font>

814
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,339
and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make a mistake</font>

815
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,549
why don't you make a mistake on being in

816
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:40,770
the more secure state a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

817
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:43,020
make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that error they forget to</font>

818
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,609
define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that way and when you go</font>

819
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,930
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your code analysis you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fell you</font>

820
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">should have defined this private oh</font>

821
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,410
sorry let me do that get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

822
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:53,650
mindset of defining everything

823
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:57,788
in the most restricted most secure state

824
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:02,920
known to man it's easier to go out to a

825
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:05,829
less secure state than vice versa again

826
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,530
it's a it's a it's a psychological issue

827
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:12,520
think of it from that perspective get

828
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:15,099
into that mindset improve yourself

829
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,770
because if you do that and you think

830
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way and you get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that routine</font>

831
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:22,500
and you go to your new company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

832
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:25,390
say I have been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have less</font>

833
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,670
vulnerabilities than my other<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-workers</font>

834
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,609
because that is the way I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

835
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:35,109
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> show it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with fewer defects with your</font>

problems your new boss that your future

838
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">lease they see that they like that just</font>

839
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:49,380
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> varying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit all yes I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write secure</font>

841
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">what type of what type of work you're</font>

842
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,319
doing writing secure code you're not

843
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,970
writing secure code you should be able

844
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:01,029
to have metrics with that you should be

845
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:04,328
able to show something I had the least

846
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:06,339
amount of rewards from IBM because I was

847
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,410
always the slowest but I was always the

848
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:11,619
mall so had the fewest number of defects

849
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,808
per line of code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if i'm</font>

850
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:15,549
selling a boasting myself there were

851
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:17,789
people who want huge awards for all

852
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:21,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">these new features but it broke so</font>

853
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:23,829
easily I had the minimum amount of

854
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:29,619
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> I but I also had the least</font>

855
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:34,299
amount of defects so I mean think about

856
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:36,910
it like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you may write a chunk of</font>

857
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:39,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">code that note that your boss doesn't</font>

858
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,339
see it a big deal but that code you

859
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,460
wrote maybe that mean the difference

860
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:47,230
between successful implementation and

00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,130
do and this was even with the old kernel

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your due diligence effort in order</font>

to implement it you can't be perfect but

881
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,480

with your employees you're not a manager

had many arguments with boss they just

888
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,849
wanted it now they wanted an immediate

they didn't care about anything else

896
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,130
doing with standards this is I like this

about what is on there once customers

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:34,200
use your code they're in now Apple has a

what Apple has the your product may not

have that much clout so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

to it you may be more secure but if it

907
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,970
breaks your customers I don't even care

may be a little understanding of you but

913
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:11,319
if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are too inflexible or you</font>

914
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,000
don't adjust properly and it causes too

915
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,960
much impact on their end they're going

00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,410
they're using

919
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,380
your competitor you're on an unemployed

920

secure developer but you're still secure

921
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,399
changing products will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be expensive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

922
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">what are you doing from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

923
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,090
beginning don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you can think</font>

924
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">about our design flexibility later it</font>

925
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:40,110
won't happen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who think</font>

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,350
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen it won't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

927
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,060
one common area in the in in looking for

928
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">flexibilities through the static code</font>

929
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,950
analysis now what I usually do when i'm

930
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at a static code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I never I don't</font>

931
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:56,220
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never I never liked the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of giving</font>

932
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,660
an end user the ability to access data

933
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,569
directly it's always through an

934
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,790
interface like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in the 1980s</font>

935
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:06,150
the drinking age in many states in the

936
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:11,040
country was 18<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay eventually it was</font>

937
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:13,710
bumped up to 21 you are you on the code

938
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that confirms if you're within a valid</font>

939
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:21,480
range to drink so if you if you give

940
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:22,950
your customer the direct the direct

941
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,260
ability to read what's in your date

942
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:29,580
what's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data structure or</font>

943
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,200
variable and he can change that now that

944
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,060
impacts you but if you work through an

945
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,980
interface you can just bump up if it's

946
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,980
less than 18 or let you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to</font>

947
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,380
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 21 much simpler and it doesn't</font>

948
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,880
impact your customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course your</font>

949
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,100
custom rule has to do a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

950
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,720
reasonable development on his or her end

951
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,500
but at least you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your due</font>

952
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,899
diligence think of the change and again

953
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,940
I've worked with PCI enough and what

954
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,190
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work rate and PCI doesn't work</font>

955
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,740
right anymore the companies that

956
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,870
survived the change with PCI are the

957
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,890
ones that role with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new changes of</font>

958
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:06,900
PCI don't be so inflexible that when pci

959
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:10,230
makes a change you're scrambling to fix

960
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,680
what's inside your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now i</font>

961
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:15,240
mention about yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm still going to go</font>

962
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,580
into code analysis now one of the

963
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,799
problems with coded out of static code

964
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,960
analysis is you can miss something like

965
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,810
heartbleed or shell shock a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code</font>

966
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,550
analysts just<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss that remember older</font>

967
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:30,029
versions of encryption work but newer

968
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:31,109
versions didn't another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font>

969
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,839
static code analysis

970
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:35,788
is that you can look at a problem from

971
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,920
an immediate perspective and say yes

972
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:40,499
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> good or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no this isn't but if</font>

973
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,180
you're doing interactive evaluations

974
00:42:40,499 --> 00:42:45,238
over time how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you</font>

975
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,788
started here is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get over here</font>

976
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,869
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind too so</font>

977
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:51,150
you need to understand the big picture

978
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,390
static code analysis tends to be more

979
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:57,239
small but it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful because</font>

980
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least identify immediate</font>

981
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:05,039
problems and correct them before they're

982
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:07,710
released now in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the area to to</font>

983
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">make yourself more flexible oh wow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

984
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,089
forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you've got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

985
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,669
modular you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

986
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,769
modularity encapsulation create a

987
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,109
component sort of a black box if you

988
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:20,700
will that does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain function</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font>

989
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:22,650
the hell out of that make sure it works

990
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,450
in and move on this is more like the

991
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,279
agile software development rather than

992
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:32,279
method rather than the waterfall

993
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:34,499
development method I hate people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

994
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:37,319
don't document and nobody seems to do

995
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:40,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that anymore I want to know why you did</font>

996
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,269
it like the way you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'd be</font>

997

people of all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for failing to</font>

998
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:45,538
document if you have to have a

00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,430
dependency or you have to have a

1000
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,460
limitation and you don't explain why

1001
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,589
your code sucks but you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a valid</font>

had a dependency if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an</font>

1004
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,130
explanation I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand why but if</font>

1005
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,829
you don't explain it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

1006
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,809
permit any soft soft static code

1007
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:05,700
analysis without proper documentation I

1008
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:07,410
don't need you to write a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1009
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,470
want you to understand I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1010
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,058
why you did what you did and in every

1011
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,669
static code analysis I've ever done

1012
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:16,200
every type of code review<font color="#E5E5E5"> I BP and they</font>

1013
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,140
hate me for this they don't think

1014
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,019
documentation is needed anymore in the

1015
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,609
old days we had a document very well you

1016
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,988
had to understand what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and</font>

1017
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:26,519
you had to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the person</font>

1018
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:30,569
who's going to take over your position

1019
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:33,269
understood it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well okay and I'm again</font>

1020
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:36,538
any data that is public or protected as

1021
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:39,118
be considered untrusted you must verify

1022
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:42,180
at all times now<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into the</font>

1023
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,440
modularity perspective what I like to do

1024
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">is I have</font>

1025
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,240
vertical functionality in here and then

1026
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,490
I have sort of like a buffer because

1027
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,970
when you change it over time from one to

1028
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:57,000
another it's easier you're still doing

1029
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:59,279
this a poor process but if you if you're

1030
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,010
more flexible to your customers needs

1031
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,830
and to regulatory needs at least it

1032
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,480
gives your customers and it gives them a

1033
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:09,390
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do less work</font>

1034
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,900
it's easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you it's easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your</font>

1035
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:15,270
code or overall there may be a cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1036
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,790
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> case where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might have to deal with</font>

1037
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:21,630
characters that might be an impact in

1038
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">your database as this cartoon says that</font>

1039
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,800
was Sandro is a legitimate last name my

1040
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,500
sister's friend was last named

1041
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,600
Alessandro but if you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it</font>

1042
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,630
over to a database environment or have a

1043
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,430
somebody read it from your buffer are

1044
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,320
you giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> him the opportunity to</font>

1045
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,210
transfer these characters to something

1046
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,350
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more satisfactory to that</font>

1047
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:44,580
person's perspective so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1048
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:47,040
cross-functional teams that's why you

1049
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,690
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your database people in you</font>

1050
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,700
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your team so</font>

1051
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,980
that you know what they need so you can

1052
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,810
provide it to them because if they have

1053
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,660
to make the change more or less they're

1054
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:59,250
going to do a poor job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

1055
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into this example because we don't</font>

1056
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,300
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of time but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example on</font>

1057
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,610
the top is something more the way I like

1058
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,780
to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you change undefined</font>

1059
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:12,480
age that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be an uninitialized value</font>

1060
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,810
minus one can be an undefined value or

1061
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">non an undefined eight in this case you</font>

1062
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:22,470
can use the current status in this code

1063
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,900
but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if undefined age is changed</font>

1064
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,930
will it work in this environment maybe

1065
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,270
maybe not this is more this may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

1066
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">little larger but it's a little bit</font>

1067
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:34,320
safer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1068
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">change if you're forced to change your</font>

1069
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:41,160
values for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in modular</font>

1070
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,549
and flexible code development you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1071
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,580
to focus more on the agile methodology

1072
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:50,310
the waterfall method you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1073
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:52,529
it's complex and it's hard because

1074
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,290
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make small iterative</font>

1075
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,150
changes over time you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

1076
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">it from a class perspective</font>

1077
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,180
or if you're doing a non<font color="#E5E5E5"> object-oriented</font>

1078
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,190
