3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,698

are not completely clued in on<font color="#E5E5E5"> gawker</font>

5
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,599
yet and so we need to establish why you

6
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:32,949
should even<font color="#E5E5E5"> go thinking about securing</font>

doctor before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would even want to</font>

you're obviously already interested in

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,690
DevOps so I have an extroverted nerd I

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,360
not only write code but I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:55,000
these communities is what will take

38
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:58,149
DevOps and make us care about security

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,739
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bryan made me care if without your</font>

47
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,190
orchestration tool because docker

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,390
changes the game from configuration

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,739
management i want to mention see if

50
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,859
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> because nobody else has yet even</font>

though Pete mentioned Burgess and

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,459
security I'm sorry service discovery and

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,079
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a community of course</font>

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm there and if you like</font>

conversation in our community you can

57
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,610
find some swag and stuff in the back

58
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,340
along with

59
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,020
my cards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk more about it</font>

60
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,460
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and of course by Kofi amounts</font>

of copious amounts of stack engine

62
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,660
goodness because my CEO told me to say

63
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,090
that all right so who are you anybody

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,010
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy does it look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

singing that song<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so how many</font>

68
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:57,070
experiment with docker on the job much

69
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,770
fewer anybody actually using docker in

70
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,420
production raise them<font color="#E5E5E5"> high please that</font>

71
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,280
is an extraordinary number of people

72
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> about by percentage typically</font>

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,310
the number in the size of this group

74
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be about pool so we had about</font>

75

triple that that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dr. with unicorns nothing man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Gandalf's</font>

77
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,820
worried about ball hogs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and docker</font>

78
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,220
does present some really scary consider

79
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,620
security concerns for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

Hobbit<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so before we go any</font>

81
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,989
farther you need to understand a bit

82
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,579
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think because I'm a little</font>

83
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">different than most people all right</font>

84
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,239
yeah yeah the pun probably makes I

85
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,890
really have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all right so I don't</font>

86
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,810
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem go what to am I going</font>

87
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,579
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use today nor do I look at a problem</font>

88
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,080
say what am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that the</font>

89
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,980
gentleman mark<font color="#CCCCCC"> tessera who was here just</font>

90
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,170
a moment ago laid out beautifully what

91
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,540
how I approach a problem I think about

92
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a philosophical standpoint why</font>

93
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,829
am i doing what I'm doing only after I

94
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,970
have worked out why I'm doing what I'm

95
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,320
doing what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody like</font>

96
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,019
Brian and say how are we going to go

97
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,579
about accomplishing this and then once I

98
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,989
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Brian and we kind of come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

99
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,239
with a model for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we're going to go</font>

100
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,450
implementation and only after we talked

102
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,690
implementation do we find the tool that

103
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,768
is going to match how we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

104
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">because what you don't want to be is the</font>

105
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:14,260
guy that says hey I have a Java

106
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:18,390
everything looks like a class so don't

107
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,390
be a tool is the lesson there all right

108
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,630
this is a interstitial slide of

109
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,460
microservices right doctor<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. docker</font>

110
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,440
means microservices microservices

111
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,450
microservices all right the basic idea

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,660
is that you have some sort of boundary

113
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,520
in which a unit of work is occurring<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

114
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so that's been around forever</font>

115
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">service-oriented architecture how many</font>

116
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you all have gone in how many of</font>

117
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">y'all have a service morning at</font>

118
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,529
architecture without<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor yeah how</font>

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of y'all really have a service</font>

120
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:47,679
architecture without docker where you

121
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,119
have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interfaces that you're</font>

122
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:51,758
coding to all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> martin fowler hotty</font>

123
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:54,579
toddy you know new cool highness yeah

124
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,829
what that means it and why well let's

125
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,929
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit see this is</font>

126
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:01,929
what docker does dr. makes micro

127
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:03,849
services available to mere mortals so

128
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:07,299
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> me this is somebody using doc</font>

129
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,649
all right container infrastructure

130
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:11,318
becomes the boundary and this is where

131
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:13,359
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets really important because before</font>

132
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,919
i had to reason against this optional

133
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:17,229
interface that i was writing in the code

134
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,639
whether it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in PHP or java or if</font>

135
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,649
you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> duct Ike languages like</font>

136
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,509
Python or Ruby you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even have an</font>

137
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,069
interface you know that you can write

138
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,329
you can I guess you can get away to some

139
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,639
abstract classes and whatnot but it's

140
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:29,349
very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what does</font>

141
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,989
docker do it creates this<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font>

142
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,909
boundary and all that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's not</font>

143
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:35,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">better or anything like that but what it</font>

144
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,539
does is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes it easier to reason</font>

145
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,969
about because I can use a container as

146
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:41,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">mnemonic for a service i can say what's</font>

147
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,329
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside this container is the</font>

148
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:45,279
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to happen inside only</font>

149
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:47,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">this container and when I want it to do</font>

150
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else I have to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to another</font>

151
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:52,539
container usually that's through some

152
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:54,489
sort of restful api aha now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

153
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">think externally it's required rather</font>

154
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:58,419
than it being optional why is this

155
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,459
important simple you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-world</font>

156
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,659
work to do and somebody is<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing on</font>

157
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,829
your head going are you done yet are you

158
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,229
done yet are you done yet it's usually

159
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:07,629
your favorite project manager and there

160
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,709
are the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important right this is</font>

161
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:11,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that's moving the business</font>

162
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,999
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to write</font>

163
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,759
that interface are you going to write

164
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:17,889
the feature if you're using docker you

165
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,329
have to do both while the interface is

166
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,889
already written for you and what's

167
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:23,379
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool is Dockers container</font>

168
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,989
technology is still super immature if

169
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:28,239
you go and compare it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 2002 bsd</font>

170
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:31,388
jail feature set it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't there</font>

171
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:33,489
yet that's no lie it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowheres close to</font>

172
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,379
zones if you have the joy of using

173
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:39,628
solaris at some point your life I mean

174
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:41,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that both figuratively and literally so</font>

175
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:44,439
what did doc or do they make them so

176
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,089
relevant they figured out how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

177
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,529
easy for developers to actually work

178
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,539
with containers to actually package

179
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,819
their code<font color="#CCCCCC"> its Dockers packaging tools</font>

180
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,089
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually making docker matter</font>

181
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,310
so what happens here you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

182
00:06:55,089 --> 00:07:00,720
extraordinary business

183
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,000
how well today you have a big ball code

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,160
and you have 50 people working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it you</font>

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,930
have 50 factorial lines of communication

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,970
that could potentially need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

187
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,330
never put 50 factorial into your

188
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:18,310
calculator and watching you know like go

189
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:20,770
alright so tomorrow what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had 15</font>

190
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,540
teams of three people each well we all

191
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,340
know from basic psychological study said

192
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,320
teams of three to five people<font color="#CCCCCC"> or self</font>

193
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,280
self organizing they don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

194
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,810
project matters they don't need

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">community they don't need communication</font>

196
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,950
facilitated for them they can just do

197
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,150
that so what that means is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from</font>

198
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:40,210
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 factorial problem to a 15 factorial</font>

199
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,440
communication problem suddenly that

200
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,590
project manager can be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,330
effective because further we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

202
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,950
infrastructure boundaries and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

203
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,960
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy over here needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

204
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,420
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this gal over here is when</font>

205
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,460
there's going to be a breaking change we

206
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,470
have severely limited the need for

207
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,909
communication now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might sound you</font>

208
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,390
know antithetical to the whole DevOps

209
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,470
culture who hugged me thing no part of

210
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem is a lot of the</font>

211
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,370
communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> going right now is simply</font>

212
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,960
waste and it's an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> friction</font>

213
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,310
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it this way do I want to do</font>

214
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,630
it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know what I don't care</font>

215
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,010
you want to write that service in Ruby

216
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,900
you go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

217
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,130
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API just the same I wanna go</font>

218
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,679
write mine and go because it needs to be

219
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,969
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right whatever goes on in</font>

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,170
that container stays in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that container</font>

221
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,140
it's kind of like Fight Club look for

222
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:26,140
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what does this</font>

223
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it means that that service because</font>

224
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,409
it's self-contained can move at its own

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,970
pace it doesn't need to wait on the user

226
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,290
management system it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

227
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,880
wait on that guy getting that thing done

228
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,750
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that he can't seem to finish</font>

229
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,909
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one more</font>

230
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,380
complication after another that service

231
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,449
can move at its own pace unless it's

232
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,669
making a breaking change more features

233
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:46,090
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into this features</font>

234
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:49,260
mean revenue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if I can sell a hammer</font>

235
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,550
online better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> my competition when</font>

236
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,130
the customer wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and buy lumber</font>

237
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,930
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store I win</font>

238
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,780
technology wins no matter what business

239
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,189
you're in so that's why dr. matters oh

240
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,180
and then there's this innovation thing

241
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,180
that mark talked about in the last

242
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,310
presentation as well innovation is the

243
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifeblood to feature development so</font>

244
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:15,399
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do a doctor</font>

245
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,480
today I want to upgrade Java how many of

246
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,390
y'all just freaked out when I said that

247
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,589
ah right especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're a</font>

248
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,600
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you've got your hand</font>

249
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,399
built a bespoke artisinal development

250
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,589
environment and so you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,690
upgrade<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java and it doesn't work and you</font>

252
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,310
say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of filthy things and then you</font>

253
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,480
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> two days to go and put your</font>

254
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,479
development environment back together

255
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,870
you can run your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java PHP whatever</font>

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,190
runtime in a container keep your code on

257
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,959
your machine with all your favorite

258
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:47,230
tooling upgrade Java run your tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

259
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:50,229
go wow look at work cool or gosh it

260
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,930
didn't it didn't you boot the docker and

261
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,990
you destroy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the doctor up you're</font>

262
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,910
ready to work again it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five</font>

263
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,100
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try that experiment now</font>

264
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,350
consider this in terms of your developer

265
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,269
behavior I want a boy if I could just

266
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,620
upgrade Java I could save myself two

267
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,450
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of all these new</font>

268
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:11,260
cool hot features that i would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

269
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,100
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> write myself hmm all right</font>

270
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,110
there are a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems with</font>

271
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that statement right now I can actually</font>

272
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,089
try it then and I can run all<font color="#CCCCCC"> my tests</font>

273
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,790
against it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's even better I can</font>

274
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,730
share that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my entire team in</font>

275
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,219
moments with a git push hey is anybody

276
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,750
using vagrant right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

277
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,850
this is the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> model as vagrant right</font>

278
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,740
so you can do this with virtual machines

279
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,930
too because so few of you raised your

280
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,550
hands and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're a developer all</font>

281
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,560
right if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead if you're moving in</font>

282
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,990
that dev ops ii direction you're not

283
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,000
ready to look at docker yet go look at

284
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,600
what vagrant can do for you it will

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,910
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you do work for the</font>

286
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,100
better click metric Brian and I were

287
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,130
able to put eight hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> per week per</font>

288
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,290
developer back in their week by moving

289
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,540
them to vagrant<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hours per</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> week per</font>

290
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,750
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten people that's like hiring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

291
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">FTEs that's cool stuff all right so</font>

292
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,230
doctor can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> you with a</font>

293
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,519
competitive business advantage but it's

294
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,050
terrifying because you have this new

295
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,310
infrastructure peace out there and all

296
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,649
these zombies are trying to get at you

297
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,599
right that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah alright so</font>

298
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,940
developer freedom is antithetical to

299
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,560
practical security remember i'm not a

300
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,180
security person so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems somewhat</font>

301
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,649
unenlightened to me it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

302
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,550
somewhat practical to me right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

303
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,910
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know a whole lot about</font>

304
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,349
security so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of afraid now</font>

305
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,400
you might think to yourself hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pick</font>

306
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,350
the wrong picture because isn't that

307
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,459
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disaster the answer is yeah</font>

308
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,500
because docker adoption will cause you a

309
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,810
disaster or two at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I promise</font>

310
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,160
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story all right a lot of</font>

311
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,140
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. adoption and</font>

312
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,939
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow process density I'm only using</font>

313
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,460
ten percent of a machine now I can get

314
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to ninety percent right yeah you can</font>

315
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,690
actually all right and what does that

316
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I mean right now we're using</font>

317
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,780
two-point-two percent of all the power

318
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,940
that's kool right there that we generate

319
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,410
in data centers and that members

320
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,480
supposed to go to like seven percent in

321
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,610
the next ten years docker adoptions are

322
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,490
cutting infrastructure costs pins by

323
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,650
fifty to eighty percent now that's not

324
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,030
me making a number up that's me talking

325
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,970
to people who have gone through docker

326
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:13,180
adoptions and measured it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in</font>

327
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,740
some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's even higher the density</font>

328
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,050
comes with its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll tell</font>

329
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you one story about a company that went</font>

330
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,490
and cut its amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> they set out the</font>

331
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,120
cutter AWS bill by forty percent ended

332
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,650
up doing it by sixty percent so they

333
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,350
were happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they're very tied to</font>

334
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,480
retail and they their marketing team

335
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,860
have this really good idea and put out

336
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,660
this promotion ahead of black friday

337
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now what happened well typically</font>

338
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,339
before dr. you know ten percent was what

339
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,480
the web server was running<font color="#E5E5E5"> had and of</font>

340
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">course load would build and build</font>

341
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,620
because marketing had a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and</font>

342
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,150
then an alarm would go off but the rate

343
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,150
was like this they had plenty of time to

344
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,850
spin<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a new machine and put the no no</font>

345
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,680
ketchup right well guess what if you're

346
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:00,430
using ninety percent of machine yo your

347
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,920
runway is not zero or site went down so

348
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,319
when you go and solve one problem you

349
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,079
often create another way of having to

350
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,240
think be wary of this don't and don't

351
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,830
try and anticipate don't not go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

352
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">docker because this could happen to you</font>

353
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:18,850
this will happen to you this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

354
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:22,030
thing hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dhaba in a sensible</font>

355
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:24,070
way and learn okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do it now this</font>

356
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,510
particular shop they are it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in their</font>

357

DNA<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the ragged leading edge of</font>

358
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,900
everything so for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> culturally it was</font>

359
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,580
cool that this happened they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

360
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">like great happen two weeks before Black</font>

361
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,670
Friday so now we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to expect for</font>

362
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,170
black friday i never they implemented

363
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:38,259
mezzos in two weeks or something like

364
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,628
that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a maid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

365
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:43,689
lessons learned from early ops adoption

366
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:45,459
will inform your security efforts start

367
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,689
now with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's low-risk some</font>

368
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,628
internal app that's been sitting there

369
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:50,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even if you break it the users of</font>

370
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,029
that internal app were just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

371
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">thrilled that you even cared to touch it</font>

372
00:13:52,029 --> 00:14:03,850
right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your app so i gave you a</font>

373
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:05,738
quick summary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. the first one was</font>

374
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">significant business advantages the</font>

375
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:09,220
second was an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cost savings</font>

376
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:10,839
that's revenue that's profit they did a

377
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,129
big interview<font color="#CCCCCC"> with me on Linux</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> com a</font>

378
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,720
little while ago if you want a whole

379
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch more of that sort of thinking and</font>

380
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,859
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> scope you know go there and</font>

381
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,629
read that have a good time I don't want

382
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:22,660
to take up all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our time talking about</font>

383
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so my answer docker is worthy of</font>

384
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,600
your consideration says docker and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

385
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,519
1 billion dollar valuation you just

386
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,709
can't ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of crazy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

387
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so now let's talk about bad actors</font>

388
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:39,999
all right identity management this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

389
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that really trips people up</font>

390
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,779
there like no it can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that bad or</font>

391
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,459
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you that it is when</font>

392
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,589
you have access to the command docker

393
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,589
run at the command line you are route I

394
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:54,459
don't care who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you are you are</font>

395
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:56,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">route orchestrations tools such as mine</font>

396
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,059
stack engine will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

397
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:00,069
ameliorate this with access control

398
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:01,238
lists and things like that so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

399
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,399
tools out there that will do this

400
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:05,109
through a GUI<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and so forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

401
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,399
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy of course can help you</font>

402
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:08,319
understand all that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> well he's</font>

403
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,819
brilliant and I'm not so if you're

404
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,959
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure something like that if</font>

405
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:12,279
you're looking to think through how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

406
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,929
I test this to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

407
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,959
actually is keeping this problem i'm

408
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:18,999
going to show you a way a guy like<font color="#E5E5E5"> james</font>

409
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,488
a guy like james wicked is the guy to

410
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:24,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so here's the command right</font>

411
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:27,159
here this will regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of who you are</font>

412
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,569
the fact that i can run docker run lets

413
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,329
me do that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it does that is</font>

414
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:33,128
that entry points which lets me take

415
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,439
whatever command was going to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

416
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:37,479
container and substitute my own command

417
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:39,309
now keeping in mind the docker daemon is

418
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:42,179
running his route I have now just

419
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:45,368
removed because I mounted as a volume

420
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:47,919
that broke them bad place sorry about

421
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:50,589
that that mounted the root users

422
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,089
directory as the root users directory in

423
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,740
the container so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remove the</font>

424
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,139
the directory in the container I'm also

425
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,689
removing the root user from the host yep

426
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,709
so that's either some bad actor or some

427
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:03,550
developer with a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

428
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,800
sometimes it's hard to distinguish

429
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,540
between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a real</font>

430
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,329
deal I actually went and tested that one

431
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,860
all right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote stack of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H a proxy</font>

432
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,449
and all its supposed to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just spin</font>

433
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,009
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> H a proxy and let it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find its</font>

434
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,779
backends you know like you got a million

435
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:19,930
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll find them for you and</font>

436
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:21,759
keep keep track of them right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

437
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with any docker image because</font>

438
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,410
you never get to the execution part of

439
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,069
the H a proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> its interrupted at RM</font>

440
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:32,230
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor came up with</font>

441
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:36,759
this idea called content trust pretty

442
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,620
cool so I hate the curl bosch and i hate

443
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,999
the github releases but this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

444
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,220
problem we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this over and</font>

445
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,720
over again indeed if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

446
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,569
what's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your Deb do you know what's in</font>

447
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,980
your dead who made that Deb right and

448
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,870
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it has a signature on it</font>

449
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,430
what does that signature actually mean

450
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:57,189
unless you know who the signer is isn't

451
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the whole point of a an ssl chain</font>

452
00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:00,490
of trust right you know the the

453
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">authenticated signer that you know the</font>

454
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,349
why do we pay all that money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Komodo</font>

455
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,089
so they came up with content trust this

456
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,289
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new idea it just rolled out with</font>

457
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:16,958
dr. 18 now what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do basically it</font>

458
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:18,220
allows a user to say hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

459
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,579
sign this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to publish</font>

460
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,829
it to the docker hub and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows you</font>

461
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,720
in your docker Damon to say I will only

462
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,879
take trusted content something that is

463
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,799
sign I won't take anything else but it

464
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,090
comes with some caveats provisos and

465
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,399
whatnot if any of you have kids that's

466
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,740
more like my favorite kid show ever so

467
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:38,678
you know rule number one I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

468
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:42,010
anybody back from the dead<font color="#CCCCCC"> so make sure</font>

469
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,409
you rtfm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because let's face it it's</font>

470
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,720
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to misinterpret what people</font>

471
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:50,049
tell you is happening make sure you know

472
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,600
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening yourself so because uh</font>

473
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:55,210
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of you who are not</font>

474
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,969
completely into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the doctor thing it let</font>

475
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">me take a brief moment to explain just</font>

476
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">from an infrastructure perspective</font>

477
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,840
what's going on today<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud you</font>

478
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,770
have a host OS you run some sort of

479
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,720
hypervisor

480
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,000
and then you run a guest OS on top of

481
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,500
that well from a security perspective

482
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,480
that sort of freaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out because they</font>

483
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,970
only have the secure this and this and

484
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,040
this one isn't necessary this is some

485
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,990
linux and this is some windows I have a

486
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,120
big pile of problems on my hands already

487
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,320
oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's this thing to you</font>

488
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,000
know if then<font color="#CCCCCC"> M anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

489
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,770
that a minute and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course I have</font>

490
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,500
all my bins and libs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the actual</font>

491
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,660
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what does docker do</font>

492
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,540
just rips out a whole pile<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff</font>

493
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,490
there is no guest OS all docker does is

494
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:40,060
it takes a piece of the colonel on the

495
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,950
actual base machine and it says here you

496
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,720
go there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually commands in dock</font>

497
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,370
where you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get this much CPU I</font>

498
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,530
get this much memory I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this much I</font>

499
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh and so forth and so on because alex c</font>

500
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,610
is under the covers so there is room and

501
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,870
here you guys if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come in I'm</font>

502
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,610
sorry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to stand out there</font>

503
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,550
right now but you know please come on in

504
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:01,740
there's there's plenty of room in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font>

505
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:04,600
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the what the grassy area so</font>

506
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,250
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big advantages this is</font>

507
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,840
where you get the density right I don't

508
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,360
have all of this weight of the OS and

509
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,649
all the risk of this OS sitting right

510
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:17,169
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so dr. as a hypervisor</font>

511
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:22,390
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not yet been able to</font>

512
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:24,460
figure this out look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all waiting</font>

513
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,560
I have not yet been able to figure this

514
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,600
out people it has become part of the

515
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,830
docker<font color="#CCCCCC"> canon the docker kool-aid you</font>

516
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:36,429
should run docker in a hypervisor

517
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:39,010
because it's more secure people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

518
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:43,420
and I'm like well let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

519
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:45,310
minute if I run docker here and my

520
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,260
application is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there how is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

521
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:51,010
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure than running doctor here</font>

522
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:53,590
what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this physical machine</font>

523
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,970
versus this virtual machine that makes

524
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,439
them any more secure that one still<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

525
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,350
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same network privileges for the</font>

526
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">application award it still has all the</font>

527
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:05,070
same firewall rules and everything right

528
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,370
there is no difference between this and

529
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so what does this hypervisor by me</font>

530
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,250
well you know it's a really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

531
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,100
is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few lines of code and this</font>

532
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,630
battle hardened right doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> break yeah</font>

533
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,649
and then there was venom remember first

534
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,820
there was heartbleed then there was

535
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,900
shell-shocked and then there was venom

536
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,210
yay

537
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,220
alright so what was venom venom was just

538
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,340
a way to crack into just to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into one</font>

539
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,350
vm get outside into the hypervisor get

540
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,659
into a second vm on that host and then

541
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:34,090
attack the application from the inside

542
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:37,030
spread yourself to another host there's

543
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,860
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very big deal in the cloud so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

544
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:43,030
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

545
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,409
docker as a hypervisor versus kvm and

546
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Zen the two most popular open source</font>

547
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,260
ones and so first off the bat docker

548
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,930
just loses<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor was born in 2013 it's</font>

549
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,670
only two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old it can't be</font>

550
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">battle-hardened yet we have to accept</font>

551
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,660
that but in the context of the possible

552
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">business advantages of docker I'm</font>

553
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:05,350
willing to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that risk in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

554
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:08,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases so Zen 2003 that is stayed right</font>

555
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,899
and kvm 2005 these are looking really

556
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:13,270
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's dig a little deeper</font>

557
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,770
lines of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. is 300 thousand lines</font>

558
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,680
of code the typical developer can keep

559
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:21,580
about 50,000 in his or her head so that

560
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,160
seems Gras<font color="#CCCCCC"> cabool right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay same is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 500</font>

561
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,000
thousand lines of code same thing kvm

562
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,060
world's most popular hypervisor 13.5

563

million lines of code as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

564
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,560
person does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak you out yeah it's</font>

565
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,940
just a general paranoid ops guy that

566
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,740
kind of freaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out right you know I</font>

567
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,350
mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know small tools do they</font>

568
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,120
do one thing right do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so yeah</font>

569
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,719
that kind of bugs me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so then</font>

570
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,330
there's code churn um this thing work

571
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,830
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so first of all go by the</font>

572
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,449
Black Duck booth and say thank you to

573
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,679
them because you can go to open hub and

574
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,600
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all kinds of really cool</font>

575
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,640
statistics about any open source project

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,240
so that's where I got these so you can

577
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:04,300
see right here you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

578
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not my friend today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

579
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever so at the top you can see that</font>

580
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,020
in about July of 2015 there's this huge

581
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,960
jump in the dot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

582
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:18,300
darker codebase what was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the</font>

583
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,040
next one down that orange line is see

584
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire jump was a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

585
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,899
language added to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> codebase that</font>

586
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,940
trips me out completely right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

587
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,710
but it's also expected in a new project

588
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,500
we think I couldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody from</font>

589
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,250
Doctor to answer me we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

590
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,630
is

591
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:39,460
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lib C I'm sorry uh live network going</font>

592
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,710
in when they acquired socket plane to do

593
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,910
their networking that was probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

594
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,080
to be written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in C so we're thinking</font>

595
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,480
that's them integrating lib network

596
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,889
we're not sure but it's a big jump it's

597
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the code base</font>

598
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:53,290
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in like two months that was</font>

599
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,850
fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so hmm that looks really</font>

600
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,700
suspicious and then I started looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

601
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Zen oh I'm sorry Zen sorry um and I give</font>

602
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,690
this sawtooth pattern now keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font>

603
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this period this relative</font>

604
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,290
period of about every two years code

605
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,940
goes up and then they pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a bunch</font>

606
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,290
of cruft code goes up they pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a</font>

607
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,690
bunch of cruft just because you're

608
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,629
seeing that up there is still plenty of

609
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,120
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on down here too so yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

610
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,070
is sudden that's a new project this is

611
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,570
an old project and it's still doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

612
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:25,450
and then I looked at kvm they don't do

613
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,189
belter away anything I mean that's

614
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,210
almost perfectly we got one inflection

615
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,700
point right here is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh let's go</font>

616
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,650
faster how many how much bit rod is in

617
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,850
there for crying out loud right I mean

618
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:39,100
who knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now the next question</font>

619
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:42,250
how fast is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually moving well doc</font>

620
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,600
removes it roughly 600 commits per month

621
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,270
over the last 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> months that's been</font>

622
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,820
their average all right new project

623
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a lot but Zen moves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it about 200</font>

624
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,340
that makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better that's</font>

625
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,320
that's something that can imagine

626
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes being built around that would</font>

627
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,870
actually tell me what's going on and

628
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:03,610
then there's p.m. at nearly 6,000

629
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:06,370
commits per month that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change</font>

630
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:08,020
and if you have to keep up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

631
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,459
that somebody's got to be making sure

632
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,410
that things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> right or they've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

633
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,660
have intentionally mature processes to

634
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,400
make sure this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> working and kvm is the</font>

635
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,360
thing behind most OpenStack appointments

636
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,010
and allegedly amazon and so forth so now

637
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">I looked at contributors well docker has</font>

638
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:27,129
you know the big big claim 600 so there

639
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,000
you go and Zen has about 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> Encke p.m.</font>

640
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:33,580
has in the last year nearly 4,000 people

641
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,720
have touched that code in a way that

642
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,399
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to submit a commit is it</font>

643
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,210
likely that one of those people had some

644
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:46,100
bad intention I think so I have bad

645
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,039
intentions so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a summary of it</font>

646
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so dr. really loses on what I</font>

647
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,700
think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key metric it's</font>

648
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:54,020
battle-hardened this right but I'm

649
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,910
willing to accept that to gain a

650
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,720
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> business advantage in certain</font>

651
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:03,260
circumstances<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zen gets a little weird</font>

652
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,960
with the I'm sorry I messed that up

653
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:11,080
that's that's wrong ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um yeah</font>

654
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:14,960
and uh kvm<font color="#E5E5E5"> loses everywhere else so you</font>

655
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know when you hear docker hypervisor you</font>

656
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,549
should run dr the hypervisor keeps it

657
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,470
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really encourage you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

658
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:23,450
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little more carefully if</font>

659
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,150
you can run docker on bare metal you're

660
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,150
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> significant savings in</font>

661
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,650
your in your usage<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright if nothing</font>

662
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,880
else running doctor and a hypervisor as

663
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,890
a security measure should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be considered</font>

664
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,780
more closely and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

665
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:39,110
open open net people I'm sorry open hub

666
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,149
net people of black duck<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so what</font>

667
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,979
does this all mean well<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the</font>

668
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,240
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I really see and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

669
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">also essentially going to be parroting</font>

670
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,750
what Mark said in his last in the last

671
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,460
hop back in 2009 ops was a bottleneck we

672
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,990
sucked we were an impediment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

673
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">business and we needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be outsourced</font>

674
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,470
and I own that today there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps</font>

675
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,210
things have changed and are changing to

676
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,250
say that it's all magical and unicorny

677
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,100
now is wrong we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

678
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,870
direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we have a clear path</font>

679
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,330
ahead of us now we understand what we're

680
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing we understand how we're going to</font>

681
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,689
do it and now it's a matter of just

682
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking the time to make the steps and</font>

683
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,299
bring people along with its alright

684
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:23,150
where is security well today<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is</font>

685
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,549
a bottleneck it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often its own silo</font>

686
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:29,510
nobody cares about it and Pete refer to

687
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:31,100
that security asshole right I was the

688
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,408
ops asshole no you may not touch my

689
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,480
server so i can understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a</font>

690
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:37,400
safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'm gripping I can't let go</font>

691
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because if I do it to my ass if</font>

692
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:44,900
something goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong hmm so how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

693
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have read the Phoenix project how</font>

many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have not read the Phoenix</font>

695
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,150
project keep your hands up

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,600
you have not read the Phoenix project

697
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:07,180
somebody wrote a book about your life

698
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:09,490
read the damn book all right for the

699
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,200
rest of you who didn't get one I'm not

700

701
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,230
way back there that's just that's just

702
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,699
asking for a lawsuit look if you haven't

703
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,470
read the Phoenix project go and read the

704
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,880
Phoenix project you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get it for two</font>

705
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,410
bucks on audible and listen to it you

706
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get it for about 15 bucks in Amazon</font>

707
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,640
if I've wasted your money pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

708
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,640
my cards call me I will buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lunch</font>

709
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,200
and refund your money now I have said

710
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,450
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well over five thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

711
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,580
in my lifetime now I have bought three

712
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,200
lunches two of them were because people

713
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:42,010
were like oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

714
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:48,460
you bout book one of them was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy who</font>

715
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:49,870
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find employment so I'm pretty</font>

716
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,220
confident that I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be shelling out</font>

717
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,360
too many bucks and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know having lunch</font>

718
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,010
with one of y'all<font color="#CCCCCC"> would wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

719
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,419
suck anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right today's security</font>

720
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,740
is the bottleneck it's often its own

721
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">little world and that's the thing that</font>

722
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,280
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be changed and I see black box</font>

723
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,590
testing is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this but</font>

724
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,410
with full cheats on you know game mode

725
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,760
right so yeah I can look at this docker

726
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:08,110
container and start poking it from the

727
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,960
outside and doing all the outside things

728
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,520
to it but I have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the code so</font>

729
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,490
that's going to inform how I poke it

730
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,820
right so while I want my testing to look

731
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,710
at it as a black box I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheat look</font>

732
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,159
inside and get some intuition about how

733
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,260
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that why well here's the</font>

734
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,420
thing quote security is just another

735
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,840
form of quality so those performance

736
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,880
right so let's stop trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinvent</font>

737
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,240
the wheel yeah we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> security we do it</font>

738
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,010
this way let's instead take all of the

739
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,960
awesome thinking around quality test

740
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,580
driven development continuous delivery

741
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,980
pipelines continuous integration

742
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:50,939
pipelines and apply those that thinking

743
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:53,680
to security because well why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

744
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,300
what this does is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes means that</font>

745
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,250
security can then move as far to the

746
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,780
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sdlc as possible and this</font>

747
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,970
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of lean and</font>

748
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Devon since DevOps is out coming out of</font>

749
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,150
the lean movement this makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

750
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,000
sense

751
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,870
if you have read how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a lot</font>

752
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,400
of you raise your head when you set up

753
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">reading how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you've read the goal</font>

754
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,970
by eliyahu<font color="#CCCCCC"> goldratt ok now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Phoenix</font>

755
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,590
project is a blatant ripoff of the goal

756
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,820
by the way the Phoenix project is a

757
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,770
novel for those of you who haven't read

758
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,659
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a technical book it's just a</font>

759
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,920
story and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say sorry that I</font>

760
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,050
kept you up all night that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you couldn't</font>

761
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,310
put the book down right now the goal is

762
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,290
equally interesting but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

763
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,730
manufacturing from<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's from days when</font>

764
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,370
you used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> smoke cigarettes in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

765
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,410
office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and call the women honey so you</font>

766
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,879
know be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for that kind of a bit</font>

767
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:42,270
bracing for me as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it as an</font>

768
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:45,490
audiobook but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of the matter is</font>

769
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,230
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again stuff that's been</font>

770
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,900
happening for 30 years it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory of</font>

771
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,040
constraints why reinvent the wheel so

772
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,330
what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> they learn well they had this</font>

773
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,290
one machine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the bottleneck on</font>

774
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:59,649
the manufacturing plant and common sense

775
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,750
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of like taking materials and</font>

776
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,920
running it through that machine and then

777
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,090
hoping they're good on the other side

778
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,190
why don't we make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the parts</font>

779
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,139
that we're having machine pass a quality

780
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,570
check before because if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't pass</font>

781
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,490
a quality check here why waste this

782
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,139
machine's time because this machine

783
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,750
dictates the cadence of the rest of the

784
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,870
manufacturing floor well guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

785
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,430
sound a bit like security so what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

786
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move security to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the head of the</font>

787
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,600
line what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could move it to the</font>

788
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,150
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sdlc and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that at</font>

789
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,909
least some sensible set of security

790
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:34,570
checks were there docker enables this

791
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:36,820
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> microservices it doesn't make</font>

792
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible it's always been possible to</font>

793
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,689
do it it simply makes it easier because

794
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,820
now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this discrete piece of</font>

795
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,270
infrastructure to test and that is much

796
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:49,570
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> drock able than 13 million five</font>

797
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:52,540
hundred thousand lines of code right so

798
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:54,159
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't make it possible dr.</font>

799
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,060
simply makes it possible for mere

800
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,160
mortals so and finally attack yourself

801
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,840
make it a game and build it into your

802
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">daily workflows let's go back to these</font>

803
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,500
micro services and micro teams for a

804
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,480
minute I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have team a working on the user</font>

805
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,440

806
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,780
class service you know school classes

807
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,250
all right great and they have an

808
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface that they have to agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

809
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:20,470
so forth but I don't know

810
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:23,620
once a week team a stops what they're

811
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,810
doing and they attack that anything that

812
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,389
they find they know guy you suck now

813
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,740
they have a throw a party hey man we

814
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">found we found these problems let's fix</font>

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,680
coat it up I'm talking about Netflix

a way to write security things that are

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and attack something and</font>

823
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,149
report back what the errors are and when

826
00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:00,220
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you found it before</font>

done faster and there was no other harm

830
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,600
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay learn to attack yourself learn</font>

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part of your daily workflow</font>

around celebrating when you find

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:41,320
to change guess what folks you own that

845
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:43,210
and again how does this come back the

846
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">docker it's simple soccer makes this</font>

847
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,010
more possible because it makes things

848
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">more easy yes I said that security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

849
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,720
form of quality there is no need to

850
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,980
invent the wheel reinvent the wheel

851
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,000
there wasn't need to invent the wheel

852
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:00,090
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it only happened needed to happen</font>

853
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,760
once all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of a</font>

854
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,889
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I want sort of tangential at the</font>

855
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,090
CD summit last last week Jess humble

856
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,500
came to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> just humbles the guy who</font>

857
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,889
offered the book continuous delivery

858
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,840
with David Farley so he is the seminal

859
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,910
founder of the idea of continuous

860
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,020
delivery and he wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> book called the</font>

861
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,390
Lean Enterprise if any of you are

862
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,490
managers you recently released that book

863
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,020
while he was at chef it's a fantastic

864
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,030
book it's a really great look at how

865
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,920
large organizations can move in much

866
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,240
more agile and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lean fashions it's really</font>

867
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,770
well done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's based on his</font>

868
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,720
experience as a consultant going to many

869
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,629
large organizations including if

870
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,640
you've ever heard of it HP applying

871
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:40,539
agile and DevOps processes to their

872
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,510
firmware successful firmware if you can

873
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:48,070
move firmware into a continuous delivery

874
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:50,379
pipeline for all you were thinking I

875
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,120
need a continuous deliria whatever yeah

876
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,700
well guess what they did it with

877
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,439
firmware take a deep breath start

878
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,610
thinking a different way well he talked

879
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this thing called the strangler</font>

880
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,879
pattern so I thought this was really

881
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because I got this big pile</font>

882
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,860
of legacy code I have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what</font>

883
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:07,179
am I gonna do<font color="#CCCCCC"> wha I know what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

884
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,819
do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rewrite it from the ground</font>

885
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:12,340
up cuz that's easy to sell the business

886
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,869
and there's no risk in that right yeah

887
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,770
me and five other guys we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

888
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,849
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over here and we're going to</font>

889
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,739
rewrite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system that's been around</font>

890
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:20,530
for 20 years that's on CD datacom in

891
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:21,790
COBOL yeah that's gonna work right know

892
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,740
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

893
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,989
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the services low-hanging</font>

894
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:27,040
fruit that that thing provides I'm going

895
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,199
to split it off and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

896
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,668
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a doctor and then when something</font>

897
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">else needs to be upgraded i want to peel</font>

898
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,368
that off and i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

899
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,049
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that and</font>

900
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,030
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a doc repeating</font>

901
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,099
and eventually what's going to happen is

902
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,810
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up with this now what</font>

903
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,790
is this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called a strangler fig</font>

904
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:46,359
and because in the rain forest near

905
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:50,649
anger what there are there is a

906
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,449
competition for sunlight the strangler

907
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:56,319
fig starts out in the top of the canopy

908
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:58,750
and grows down around a tree eventually

909
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,250
strangling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree and coming to life</font>

910
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:06,640
itself so this is CD datacom and these

911
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:10,240
are our microservices it has to happen

912
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:16,029
over time taking a big boom doesn't work

913
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:18,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a saying for this think</font>

914
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,320
evolution not revolution revolutions are

915
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,790
bloody and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have the outcome</font>

916
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,280
that they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Bolshevik</font>

917
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,630
Revolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> yadda yadda yadda all right</font>

918
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:33,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> great leap forward probably not so</font>

919
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,270
think about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evolve not revolve</font>

920
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,788
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was is there anything</font>

921
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,839
else that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

922
00:35:38,789 --> 00:35:45,930
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> doc or pipeline so the first</font>

923
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,750
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would tell you is like a like</font>

924
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:51,419
any sort of execution make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

925
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,730
thing that's executing your code is some

926
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,950
automated process not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human and then</font>

927
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:59,730
humans except for two or three trusted

928
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:02,069
ones cannot get in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and execute arbitrary</font>

929
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,619
code right so that's kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bait</font>

930
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:07,079
that's that's kind of a basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement</font>

931
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:08,640
so 11 pneumonic that Brian and I had we

932
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,680
didn't ever do this but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

933
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know the old manufacturing thing</font>

934
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,430
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason's last accident right and</font>

935
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,660
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like 62 and then somebody</font>

936
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,970
fall and break your leg and they'd erase

937
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,259
anything back<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 right I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always wanted</font>

938
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put up on our whiteboard days since</font>

939
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,589
last production log in it was the same

940
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing right so and there as a fun metric</font>

941
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:29,490
for so that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how I</font>

942
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:32,130
would kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go about approaching that</font>

943
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:34,680
from the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense all right</font>

944
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,940
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the this big pile of spaghetti</font>

945
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,180
that you're already running behind your

946
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,670
firewall keep all of those services

947
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,020
behind the bat firewall to those should

948
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:48,839
not be public<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should be in a VPC</font>

949
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,819
somewhere what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and ssl/tls that</font>

950
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,770
way a bad actor on your network can't

951
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:54,359
look at what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on between two</font>

952
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,480
services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start stealing information</font>

953
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,910
like credit card numbers right how did

954
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,220
those 70,000 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 million cards leave</font>

955
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,828
target I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they know yet I</font>

956
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,660
know this if I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal something</font>

957
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:08,190
that's how I would do it is one card at

958
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time with some little process that</font>

959
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,210
nobody's seen so if I can secure the

960
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,410
communication between them with TLS now

961
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,270
as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I don't have access to that</font>

962
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:19,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret I don't have access to the</font>

963
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:21,990
information so that that's that's a

964
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,549
start again docker is not awesome with

965
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">insecurity it's one of their biggest</font>

966
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,730
problems they know it and they're

967
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,010
working on it with 19 new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

968
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming so again keep that in mind don't</font>

969
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,490
run the crown jewels of your

970
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,109
organization and doctor tomorrow now go

971
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,270
strangling the crown jewels of your

972
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:38,569
organization with soccer tomorrow find

973
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:42,210
something that needs strangling and

974
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:45,450
strangle it first get wise answer these

975
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,490
questions with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience your</font>

976
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,299
company's requirements because you might

977
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,069
be HIPAA

978
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might be FERPA or I might just</font>

979
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,280
have a bunch of data that I have

980
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,330
collected<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Twitter that I'm</font>

981
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,220
aggregate you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all public</font>

982
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,690
data I don't care anyway right so we

983
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,100
each have our own context<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

984
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,100
answer these questions in as well I

985
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:10,190
