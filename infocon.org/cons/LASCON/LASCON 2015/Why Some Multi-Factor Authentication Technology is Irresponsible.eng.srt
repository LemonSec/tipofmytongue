00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:25,380
thank you well one more sound test can

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you hear me in the back if not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,570
great so again my name is Claire Nelson

4
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:37,860
and I make enemies for a living I am not

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,280
connected with any industry analyst

6
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,470
organization I'm not connected with any

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
multi-factor authentication vendors I'm

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,460
an independent voice that's why I make

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,190
the enemies and hopefully today you will

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,920
learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mistakes in my trials and</font>

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">tribulations I recently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assessed and</font>

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,839
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess over 200 multi-factor</font>

13
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,269
authentication vendors and have been

14
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,159
unsuccessful<font color="#CCCCCC"> in finding a solution for</font>

15
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,709
my client who says they want two things

00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,350
they want banking great<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and</font>

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,199
they want a seamless UX because unlike

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,920
their problem is the external employee

21

or mean the external customers the

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,850

use biometrics and india some of the the

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,669
trends are different so it really does

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,019
change depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your geography so</font>

who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the definition for</font>

revised they recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> made some requests</font>

45
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,860
for people to give input on revising the

51
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,610
separate categories of something you

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">know something you have something you</font>

53
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,710
are and so I asked NIST well what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,420
what's the origin of this definition

55
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,100
from whence did it come because I really

56
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,839
want to understand because I really

57
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,180
disagree with a lot of what's in there

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,030
and they informed me they did not know

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,300
go ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene spafford i asked the real</font>

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,770
staff and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so how</font>

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,660
can you write a definition if you don't

62
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,520
know the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're working on</font>

63
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,230
multi-factor authentication you don't

64
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,270
have a coherent definition how do you

65
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,000
proceed there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a growing</font>

66
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,650
chasm between the NIST definitions and

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,820
some of these new more creative

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,710
definitions and so what you see is

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,310
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to use location or</font>

70
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,110
time or device ID and can you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

71
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:24,210
that microphone please they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:27,010
use different factors if you will and

73
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,250
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST you cannot use time</font>

74
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:35,230
location or device ID as a factor for

75
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,670
multi-factor authentication and these

76
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:41,410
are great words<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my</font>

laptop these are great words from<font color="#CCCCCC"> FFIEC</font>

78
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,630
those of you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the financial services</font>

79
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,730
world know that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one</font>

80
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,070
authentication method that's bomb-proof

81
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,220
foolproof hack proof I've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

82
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,329
one exception I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it later</font>

83
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,010
digital authentication technologies

84
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,870
they're more of a DoD play it's

85
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,239
expensive and they have a new way of

86
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,980
doing context-based location

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,750
fingerprints that's later on but

88
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,739
everything else I've run across can be

89
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:13,260
easily hat not not via a nation-state

90
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,260
but via someone with a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small budget</font>

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,540
really does have a mind of its own so

92
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,760
why are there so many vendors it's a

93
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,220
very difficult problem to solve take

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,050
everything from encryption to human

95
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,000
psychology and go solve for all the

96
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,830
variables in between so you're solving

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,320
for an equation that's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,330
variables simultaneously very tough

99
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,110
problem and the iphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> of authentication</font>

100
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">has yet to be invented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhones not such</font>

101
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,740
a big deal right now but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,419
transformational shift when it came out

103
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,150
and today what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people doing for</font>

104
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:50,150
authentication it's just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> step above</font>

105
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,770
Hardware tokens for authentication we

106
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,489
have soft tokens and we use a mobile

107
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:00,740
device authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still in</font>

108
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:02,690
caveman stages we just went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one slide</font>

109
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so there are many sub optimal</font>

110
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:10,340
choices that multi-factor authentication

111
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,020
authentication vendors are using and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

112
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alert you for a couple of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a customer some of</font>

114
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,710
these may be foisted upon you and then

115
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,740
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two if it's your responsibility</font>

116
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,750
to set policy or number three you're

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,490
creating a product that does

118
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,780
multi-factor authentication these are

119
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,150
just some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things to keep in mind</font>

120
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,210
and some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll cover are in</font>

121
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:37,068
the the biometrics field 2d fingerprints

122
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,258
SMS OTP QR codes and there are a lot of

123
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:41,270
behavioral biometric authentication

124
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,490
vendors and they have a strange

125
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,219
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to insert</font>

132
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,419
this simply won't work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this</font>

133
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,180
technology perceives maybe two or three

134
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,639
years down the road it may be something

135
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,620
to use oh this some slip without me

136
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,940
looking there's over reliance on GPS

137
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,639
there was a company in town anyone here

138
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,270
from twofer I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 14</font>

139
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,729
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they really didn't use multiple</font>

140
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,109
factors well turns out they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

141
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,800
last laugh they were acquired by

142
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,380
Salesforce but it just you can't over

143
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,150
rely on GPS to location i'll tell you

144
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,340
more about that later and of course

145
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,270
we'll talk about weak recovery methods

146
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,619
and your mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are secure right</font>

147
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:45,530
trust a device for<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and</font>

149
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,539
source of the crypto libraries what's a

150
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,190
random number generator in their mind

151
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,080
who's really doing it and you can't just

152
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">look on someone's website to assess a</font>

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,830
vendor and what they're doing

154
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,630
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do roll up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really doing the work and ask them</font>

157
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,130
deep gnarly questions and get answers so

158
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:11,500
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of irrational</font>

159
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,680
exuberance going on with biometric

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,599
adoption and according to Juniper

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Research 770 million apps that use

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year twenty nineteen 770 million</font>

164
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:32,020
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> up from six million 2015 and most</font>

165
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,720
of its fingerprint now I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

166
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,409
these statistics going from six million

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,680
in 2015 to 770 million i thought that

168
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:43,810
must be wrong is it a typo well I then I

169
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,430
found out they are accounting for a very

170
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:50,639
unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> population you know that did</font>

171
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,620
autumn adding touch that it's the feline

172
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,039
population there's a and by the way I

173
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,050
have footnotes on almost every slide and

174
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can reference there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little video</font>

175
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">here it's quite comical I'm not sure if</font>

176
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:10,000
it's real but it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite comical so who</font>

177
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:15,430
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> who this is what's being done to</font>

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,780
her I was at bsides Austin and I asked

179
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,120
the question what's being done to her

180
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,419
and some smart<font color="#CCCCCC"> alec in the back said</font>

181
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,780
she's getting a proctology exam but no

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> german defence minister ursula</font>

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,809
hacked there's a gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the name</font>

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,250
grandmaster at this and again back to

191
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,230
does he have the backing of a nation

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,339
hacks every generation that comes out

<font color="#CCCCCC">six he has been publishing his findings</font>

199
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:17,709
here is I'm wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's auto</font>

200
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,449
advancing if anyone has any insight into

201
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,008
why my slides or<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto advancing come</font>

202
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:23,469
talk to me if any way here there's a

203
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:25,089
video this is the reference to it I urge

204
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,279
you to watch this it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

205
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Starbuck goes through the</font>

206
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:35,050
entire process of faking touch ID so in

207
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:40,509
the title of my talk I use the big word

208
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,430
you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

209
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:43,809
be a slam and by the way the whole goal

210
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this talk is to elevate the</font>

211
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:46,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion of multi-factor</font>

212
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,809
authentication so we're all a little

213
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:52,628
more educated but if you go to black hat

214
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:55,269
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON and you listen to way and</font>

215
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:58,480
saying this is one this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there</font>

216
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:01,779
slide deck and it shows how from the

217
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,170
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch the sensor before it gets</font>

218
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:07,629
to a safe place your fingerprint can be

219
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,099
stolen or lifted right that's that's no

220
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,589
big deal if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to DEFCON or black</font>

221
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,660
hat you're educated about that but look

222
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:17,709
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red writing this can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in</font>

223
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,410
large scale where is this from forbes

224
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,420
magazine it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> common knowledge now so</font>

225
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,490
you there is no longer an excuse from

226
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,498
some of the the authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

227
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh we didn't know about it it's not that</font>

228
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:32,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it's esoteric it can only be</font>

229
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,509
done one at a time it's just a targeted

230
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:38,470
threat at one person this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done at</font>

231
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:40,329
scale oh it ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advance for me</font>

232
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it's almost in time with me I</font>

233
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:46,569
wonder if this is set on time well so

234
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:51,029
anyway I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this is a test a</font>

235
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:55,449
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hands in one corner we have</font>

236
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:57,790
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crisler AKA starbug and in the</font>

237
00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:00,550
other corner we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan Richie Oh a</font>

238
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,498
senior VP from apple now when I went

239
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,149
through this at apps tech USA there was

240
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,459
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentlemen from apple and they left</font>

241
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,040
the room so if anyone's from apple today

242
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,498
I apologize ahead of time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan</font>

243
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,389
michiyo from Apple he says fingerprints

244
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:16,870
are one of the best passwords in the

245
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,250
world on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand we have starbug</font>

246
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,710
who says don't use fingerprint

247
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,930
recognition

248
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,960
systems for security relevant

249
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,670
applications so who votes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

250
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,810
ricchio silence who votes for starbug

251
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,930
but all of you are awake and well

252
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:36,739
caffeinated Bravo I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

253
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">advancing and I've apologized I have a I</font>

254
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,880
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this do this if I wanted</font>

255
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,439
to so in the world of behavioral

256
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,110
biometrics this is a case where they're

257
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,290
measuring how you type how you swipe the

258
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,670
pressure the rhythm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's one</font>

259
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,829
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again I</font>

260
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,839
talked earlier it has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

261
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,120
requirement there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other issues</font>

262
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">are about privacy if your hand is</font>

263
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,330
injured if you break your hands start to

264
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,100
use another hand this won't work and

265
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,250
then here's a quote from one of the

266
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,990
founders if you are highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> intoxicated</font>

267
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,400
this may not work now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

268
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,980
bright side let's talk about something

269
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,020
positive of some research people are

270
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,060
doing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of multi-factor</font>

271
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,510
authentication and this is again in the

272
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,180
domain of behavioral biometrics so I

273
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,950
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user experience it</font>

274
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,930
really should be invisible I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

275
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to authenticate and have a great</font>

276
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:35,449
user experience instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of go go</font>

277
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:38,480
downstairs get my phone SMS ok so this

278
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,990
company has a concept called invisible

279
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,090
challenge adds a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little creepy it's bio</font>

280
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">cats from Israel bear with me but what</font>

281
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,070
they do is they collect over 500

282
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,140
parameters of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your behavior so they know</font>

283
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,580
it's you and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things they</font>

284
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,110
track is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when your cursor goes</font>

285
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,680
away what do you do you juggle your

286
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,390
mouse well they contend that that jiggle

287
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,430
and a few other factors are unique to

288
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,720
you so if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy your</font>

289
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,069
online you're going to buy a six

290
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320

see how your gigolo oh it's you go ahead

294
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,960
it's fine so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole concept though</font>

295
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,430
of invisible challenges is something

296
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,900
they're working on and then they could

<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chain together multiple</font>

challenges not just the mouse jiggle but

299
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:29,330
you get my point so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of</font>

collecting all of this information and

what kind 3d fingerprint right and in

red here no matter how advanced the

323

biometric is what it's the same threat

model it's the same basic threat model

325
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,760
so someone came to me go Claire someone

327

<font color="#CCCCCC">that more secure than fingerprint no no</font>

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,330
matter what biometric is being used it's

329
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,150
the same basic threat model you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

330
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,700
sensor you collect you match there's

00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,670
some ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more hard</font>

332
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:09,500
to crack this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wonder why my</font>

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,230
what the biometric is being you is the

335
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,459

336
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,150
answer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you stop a</font>

338
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,829

339
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,949

342
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:43,600
you can all see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get ya</font>

343
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:46,570
okay so ask for a threat model you may

344
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,640
not get a threat model you may get

345
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,650
excuses I've asked a number of vendors

346
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,810
for the threat model how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

347
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:58,689
replied with a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> model 00 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

348
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:02,739
there's a person his name is John Steven

349
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:05,350
formerly of sigil he's now the CTO of a

350
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,839
company called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Skoda scope it's a</font>

351
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,910
spinoff from digital the Google John

352
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,550
Steven you learn one thing that take

353
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,500
away in terms of a threat model and how

354
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,029
to do a threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> model he's the master at</font>

355
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,190
it there's some other schools of thought

356
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:20,500
and other models and frameworks for

357
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,029
threat modeling but he's one of the best

358
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was here in Austin number of you</font>

359
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:36,420
may have taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> his workshop on threat</font>

360
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:40,180
modeling so some posit that fingerprints

361
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,430
might be usable as user names but they

362
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,239
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to authenticate an</font>

363
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,770
identity why they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a secret that</font>

364
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,290
you can't in plus they're not revocable

365
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,939
how you in every time I say they're not

366
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,360
revocable someone raised as well you

367
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,160
could acid and say it's painful if you

368
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,560
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> our difficult or complex but</font>

369
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,170
for the most part you can't change your

<font color="#E5E5E5">fingerprints it's not you can reset a</font>

373
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,329
biological markers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

374
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,010
difficult problem and this is from

378
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:32,709
also known as dr. future he says that we

379
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,780
don't discuss the consequences of the

380
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,150
errors and error rates associated with

381
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,850
biometrics who here took their cissp

382
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:43,330
exam so you know what far for an hour

383
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,699
are far false acceptance rate for false

384
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,449
reject rate and you just took tell you

385
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,679
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're fresh off the boat therefore</font>

386
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,870
cissp LAN well you learn that these

387
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960

rate whoops that platinum customer we

390
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,730
rejected them and no one's really

391
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,439
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these and it reminds me</font>

392
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,529
there's a Harvard psychologist and she

393
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,200
says a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are frequently in</font>

394
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:16,039
error but rarely in doubt that's how I

395
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe biometrics and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing with</font>

396
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,408
dr. future is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he says that the</font>

397
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,350
biometrics can be grabbed without our

398
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:26,750
consent we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always know when our</font>

399
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:32,449
biometrics are being lifted from our

400
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:35,779
person so I'm predicting the biometric

401
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,600
backlash it's a question not if but when

402
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:43,340
and I'll draw your attention to number

403
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:47,000
three here when identity theft is linked

404
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,039
to stolen biometrics I think you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,320
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more activity around this this</font>

406
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,408
whole people are really it's a trend

407
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,010
it's a fad use biometrics especially for

408
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,809
external customers and the the OPM

409
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,429
breach first they said it's only 1

410
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,980
million fingerprints that were stolen

411
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,990
now it's over 56 million fingerprints a

412
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:12,080
few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we might learn that it's</font>

413
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">more so let's talk about SMS OTP that's</font>

414
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,960
safe right dmitrichenko and some of his

crack SMS OTP almost instantly it was a

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:30,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">no-brainer for them academic papers from</font>

Northeastern and other collaborators SMS

00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:36,289
OTP is not secure now why don't we see

421
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,709
this in in public from an industry

422
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:42,169
analyst or in dark reading or wherever

423
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:45,260
you go how come it takes someone from

424
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:49,429
academia<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say SMS OTP is not secure</font>

425
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,950
why is that I'm stumped I don't know why

426
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:54,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's part of the reason is do a lot</font>

427
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,899
of companies I won't name some larger

428
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,320
ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are invested in SMS OTP and</font>

429
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:00,209
they're still using it today

430
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,340
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a chance you can</font>

431
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,039
speak back if someone gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an</font>

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,110
authentication method to use you as a

433
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,799
customer can speak back and give your

434
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,809

customer Charles Schwab I am still and

436
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,918
they didn't have any authentication

437
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:18,539
method beyond username and password so I

438
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,789
asked them what's available and they

439
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:26,820
snail mailed me a hardware token so and

440
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:29,309
that's all they have available so part

441
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this too is weak as consumers can be</font>

442
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,779
more informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more selective and</font>

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:36,719
give feedback when something is foisted

444
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:40,320
upon us and then here's the threat model

so who refuses to use QR codes it's yeah

464
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:45,379
the thing is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where you're</font>

465
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:47,209
going it's like driving blind and even

466
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:51,080
when they say here's a URL who reads the

467
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:53,659
URL so you could get a link to a

468
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,449
malicious site and if you're talking

469

<font color="#E5E5E5">about something that has a high level of</font>

sprig thank you do you want to UM you

Thank You Joseph so there's a company

486
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,678
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> sprig out of New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City it</font>

487
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,509
might be a guy living with his mother he

488
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,389
doesn't the company is still being

489
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:04,190
formulated but he says how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

490
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:06,620
the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

491
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,559
second floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a building and the 31st</font>

492
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,100
floor he says you really need latitude

493
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,960
longitude and altitude all of those and

494
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">then he has a few patents he's trying to</font>

495
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,769
gather he's trying to get his company up

496
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:23,870
and running it's s priv and he's really

497
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:26,570
trying to tell people that latitude and

498
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,008
longitude are insufficient and then

499
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,450
here's another company this is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

500
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:32,059
all the 200 vendors that I've been

501
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,429
assessing this is the only one that

502
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:37,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">hasn't been hacked to my knowledge and</font>

503
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:40,570
it's digital authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies</font>

504
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:43,190
and they have what's called a contextual

505
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,789
location fingerprint and they're really

506
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at</font>

507
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,500
low-frequency emissions they're looking

508
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,000
at your context and does require a

509
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,330
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of hardware oh by the way</font>

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their DoD and there was a lot people</font>

511
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about their technology but they</font>

512
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:05,060
have a method for looking at your

513
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,330
context and realizing if you move away

514
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:11,179
from a specific context that's digital

515
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,520
authentication technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

516
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,610
familiar with dr. todd humphreys here at

517
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,050
UT Austin he's been spoofing have you

518
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,659
seen some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his work he's been spoofing</font>

519
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,340
GPS for years he and his students every

520
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,500
year and then again this is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

521
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,470
nation-state this is low budget he and

522
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,980
his students<font color="#CCCCCC"> will spoof GPS one way or</font>

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,090
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years it's not really a</font>

525
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,280

526
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">will work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we're almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over and we've</font>

527
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,410
got it going thank you so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

528
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">the google product manager Eric sacks</font>

529
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,470
what's the Achilles heel of

530
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:50,420
authentication account recovery and

531
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:53,180
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Fido</font>

532
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,790
Alliance later on out of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

533
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:59,060
they're collecting how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money are</font>

534
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:01,190
they spending on account recovery right

535
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,159
zilch so there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of issues</font>

536
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,080
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and until we get</font>

537
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,210
the account recovery that's still an

538
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,800
open door for the bad guys we're locking

539
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,860
the front door but we're leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

540
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,430
back door open how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use</font>

541
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,429
google authenticator I had to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

542
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,930
of course and so in my wallet I printed

543
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:26,210
out on hard copy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten recovery keys</font>

544
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,160
I've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and someone told me that</font>

545
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you used up all ten you can go</font>

546
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,910
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get another batch but I'm</font>

547
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,189
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that because I'm afraid to</font>

548
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,140
lose my accounts is if so if anyone's

549
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,270
gone through that let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but here</font>

550
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,240
it is 2015 and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little piece of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">paper and I can have another P node but</font>

552
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:49,010
if you lose these what happens you're

553
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,580
sol so again if anyone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

554
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:55,129
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will give you low reward</font>

recurring theme deja vu all over again

has been hacked and they take measures

571
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:46,049
and others the just you again you're

572

a double standard and it's it's it's

almost tongue-in-cheek and this is an

multi-factor authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> semantic VIP</font>

579
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,539
and what do they give<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the customers</font>

580
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:08,428
face and voice now granted they are two

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> use cases and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

582
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,419
started one and the security guys

583
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,520
probably selected<font color="#CCCCCC"> semantic and the</font>

584
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:18,270
product managers probably selected face

585
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,070
and voice but why why is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this</font>

586
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,260
growing chasm between what's used

587
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,139
internally and what's used for external

588
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,879
customers and we are the external

589
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:33,990
customers they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll use</font>

590
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:36,299
space and voice from my own accounts so

591
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,070
we have a perfect storm I speak about

592
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:41,639
all these vendors they're chasing almost

593
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">two billion dollars in revenue and Apple</font>

they're promoting biometrics and they

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,080
also have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange ideas about where</font>

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,840
the secrets are stored would you rather

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,639
store secrets on a hard and server or on

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,500
don't care about it I have a friend she

thinks it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheese you know to her</font>

615
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,010
it's cool to download<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these three</font>

618
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,320
they want to store secrets on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,500
their architectural diagrams etc and

621
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,910
they're thinking I won't say any more

622
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,530
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fido alliance because I want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respect what they're doing but there</font>

624
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:59,129
but there are some issues with their

625
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">work and this is where it comes from</font>

626
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:04,440
it's the legacy thinking and who's this

627
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,990
author it's David birch he's the author

628
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,840
of identity is the new money if there's

629
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,480
one book you want to read this year

630
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,389
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity i recommend david birch</font>

631
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,760
or google his name he's got great videos

632
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:21,420
and he's the kind of person that asks

633
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,660
profound questions they go oh yeah for

634
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,530
instance he'll ask why is our name on a

635
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,990
credit card whom does that serve the bad

636
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:34,740
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's my credit card I know</font>

637
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that number but if I lose it it helps</font>

638
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,310
the bad guy so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again if you want to read</font>

639
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">one book about identity I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

640
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">David birch let's talk a little bit</font>

641
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,580
about IOT and how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing one time</font>

642
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right so Cisco thinks there</font>

643
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,760
would be 50 billion<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT things around I</font>

644
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,520
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care how many there are a lot of</font>

645
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,580
them and if you're going to authenticate

646
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,670
them you're in deep kimchi you're in

647
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,340
deep yogurt your deep anything it's a

648
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,170
nightmare and I'll draw attention to

649
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:17,399
what's coming down the pike this is not

650
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:20,730
on ooo sorg yet this is a preview this

651
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,260
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP IOT top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 there's a person</font>

652
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,410
named

653
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:28,010
bastian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gloria and he has started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

654
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,720
work on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT top 10 so don't take</font>

655
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as gospel yet but it's a preview of</font>

656
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,370
what's to come and you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

657
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,850
authentication and authorization are

658
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:41,120
high on his list so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

659
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:44,780
predictions of issues we will see with

660
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,629
IOT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication and the first one</font>

661
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,790
is creative cryptography and that is

662
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,560
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oxymoron because the last</font>

663
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,360
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do if I'm hiring some</font>

664
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:56,179
crypto guys do I want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

665
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,699
creative no I want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smart good</font>

666
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,040
and alert and have good crypto hygiene

667
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,390
and so what some of the guys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Intel</font>

668
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,710
are doing with epid enhanced privacy ID

669
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,480
instead of the one-to-one mapping that

670
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,240
we're all used to seeing the mapping of

671
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,140
a public and a private key will they

672
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,730
have one too many mapping of a public to

673
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,790
private keys and what does this do to

674
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:21,110
the threat surface it makes it bigger so

675
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:24,230
some would say well you're splitting

676
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,639
hairs but I like to split hairs and this

677
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,790
is one example you'll see more

678
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,670
variations on the theme of where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

679
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,260
are taking creative measures with crypto

680
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,630
because they are in constrained

681
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:40,150
environments another thing you'll see

682
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:43,700
them doing is taking protocols and

683
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:46,970
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having HTTPS you might have a</font>

684
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:50,120
protocol called co-op so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

685
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Autobahn how fast can you go 70 80</font>

688
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,960
down there are potholes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when</font>

689
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,699
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go from HTTPS to co-op</font>

690
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,780
you're going to run into all kinds of

691
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,780
problems and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are predicting the</font>

692
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,860
programmers creating it have to know

693
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,410
what they're doing because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on a bumpy uneven Road and you're</font>

wary of some of the things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

697
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,730
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the pike with IOT and taking</font>

698
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,950
the protocols that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist today and put</font>

699
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,990
them in a very small constrained world

700
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,380
so what's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better solution a better</font>

701
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:32,450
solution is to design from from day one

702
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,040
from the ground up take the co-op

703
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,840
protocol or

704
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,600
these constrained environments and

705
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,070
design the authentication specifically

706
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,679
for that environment don't take

707
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:48,669
something else that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed with</font>

708
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:53,570
fewer constraints some people are saying

709
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:57,950
consider risk-based authentication look

710
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:59,540
at the different factors and if you take

711
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one of these like the source IP</font>

712
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,740
reputation how good is that it may not

713
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,480
be that good if you have enough factors

714
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,910
strung together<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe that will work and</font>

715
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,170
so I call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> never seen the movie in</font>

716
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:13,220
someone's in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City and they have</font>

717
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:15,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 lakhs on their door well does 10</font>

718
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,000
lakhs equal one good<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock kind of bad</font>

719
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,230
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> still come in and then the bad guy</font>

720
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,200
comes and they just kick the door open

721
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:26,570

766
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:35,149
lateral moves you need to know you need

767
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,740
to have continuous authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

768
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,060
have a high-risk environment and if you

769

<font color="#E5E5E5">really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's not a bad</font>

770

guy and then depending on your risk

771
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:48,920
scenario you can combine different

772
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:52,070
methods or you can create multiple

773
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,360
chains or steps I have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> client and</font>

774
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,640
they have three buckets for

775
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,710
authentication in the first bucket<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

776
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,210
have regular old multi-factor

777
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,380
authentication something you know

778
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,530
something you have something you are

779
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,410
they tick<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in the second bucket they</font>

780
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:10,070
are adding extra parameters geolocation

781
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:13,700
time device ID and in the third bucket

782
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:14,990
they have context-based analytics and

783
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,230
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get predictive in the</font>

784
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,729
future so they combine all of that

785
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:22,340
irregardless of performance because risk

786
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,680
is high they add all that together and

787
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:30,920
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a suitable</font>

788
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:33,879
multi-factor authentication solution so

789
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,880
without any questions

790
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:41,540
yes right so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is I talked</font>

791
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS OTP the question is about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TOTP</font>

792
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,130
or time-based OTP it's the same scenario

793
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,520
if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work of way and zhang</font>

794
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,590
zhi and<font color="#E5E5E5"> g they've looked at OTPs as well</font>

795
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,740
as the fingerprint and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

796
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:57,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend micro report that talked about</font>

797
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:59,600
operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emmental and then the other</font>

798
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,089
the third resource was<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel's</font>

00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,759
dmitrichenko for SMS OTP and the four

00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:07,160
largest banks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a matter that the</font>

801
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing wasn't the issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so the</font>

802
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,379
question is and that that's where they

803
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,200
hardware token then so in the use case

804
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,780
that i was looking at is no Hardware

805
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,839
tokens and looking at the case where you

806
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,510
have not internal employees but external

807
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,970
customers that require two basic things

808
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,070
they require banking grade security and

809
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,109
a seamless user experience because if

810
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,820
I'm Netflix and I've got millions and

811
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,610
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers I'm not going to</font>

812
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,570
send them Hardware tokens I need

813
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:40,550
something that has a fairly seamless

814
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:45,110
frictionless user experience but that's

815
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:46,190
nuts thank you thanks Mike I have help

816
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:52,130
from the audience answering my own

817
00:37:46,190 --> 00:38:00,650
questions yes they have right any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

00:37:52,130 --> 00:38:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions you know them right and and</font>

819
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:04,030
you don't trust them immediately when

820
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:06,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet somebody you don't trust them</font>

821
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,060
you don't trust people immediately you

822
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,279
get to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then you trust them</font>

823
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,259
happy have you ever thought about any

824
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,440
kind of authentication system that kind

825
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of gradually granted permissions or use</font>

826
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,030
the more human model or pretty bizarre

827
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,590
questions so you don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

828
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,870
well no that's right on because in the

829
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">future the model will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be not</font>

should they be tomorrow for the for this
