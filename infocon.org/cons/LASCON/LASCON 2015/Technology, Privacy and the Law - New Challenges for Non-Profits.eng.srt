of communications from the Tor project

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,440
so that kind of gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a frame of</font>

45
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,610
where where my thinking comes

<font color="#E5E5E5">it was an interesting two years at tour</font>

49
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,040

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:49,450
see privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and information on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and over the course of my life</font>

52
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,780
and my career in information security

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,130
that's only been five years I've

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,910
considered that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> become the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bridge</font>

55
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that helps to shorten the gap between</font>

56
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,410
technical and non-technical users so for

57
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,840
17 years I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the business</font>

cyberstalking and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am hopefully</font>

this time next year you might be calling

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:26,230
me dr. Masada i'm planning on defending

65
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:29,470
in may but weaving in all of those

66
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,630
experiences of a business mind a

67
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,120
personal experience around security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

68
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,790
privacy now combined with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,900
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> my PhD is like the big picture</font>

70
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:44,920
view into my brain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

71
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,570
mom of two teenage daughters I picked a

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,380
nice picture this year and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a goofy</font>

73
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,780
pictures so they'll be happy but

74
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically I live my life through</font>

75
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,450
rose-colored glasses I spent five years

76
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,890
down in the deepest darkest places I

77
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:07,660
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even imagine before that event</font>

78
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,609
happened and coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it I put my</font>

79
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,980
rose-colored glasses back on because

80
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">even the time that I spent at tour and</font>

81
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,700
towards a great place is too great

82
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,880
technology they're great great people

83
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,039
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend a little bit of time</font>

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,590
in the hacker community or in a place

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,990
like tor you realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font>

86
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,299
of evil in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world right would</font>

87
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,580
everybody agree that there's horrible

88
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,160
stuff going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the world and you can</font>

89
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,620
either spend your time kind of down in

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bowels of that or you can rise out</font>

91
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,360
of it or choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to be in it I chose</font>

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,830
not to be a minute okay

93
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,490
I'm choosing not to be afraid anymore

94
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,960
i'm choosing not to think about all the

95
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,099
bad actors in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it's</font>

96
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,289
part of my research now so my life my

97
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:57,210
research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I approach this</font>

98
00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,659
talk and everything I do now is through

99
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,030
rose-colored glasses so it's not that

100
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:05,188
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm naive to all the bad crap out in the</font>

101
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,679
world and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't swear like some of the</font>

102
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:11,129
other people who've spoken at last<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,110
in years past but so what i want to give

104
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:14,669
you to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just sort of a big</font>

105
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,469
picture view of some of the work that

106
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:18,628
I've been doing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past year and</font>

107
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:20,430
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've learned and the</font>

108
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:22,979
reason why is that I want to show you

109
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work that you're doing on</font>

110
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,830
this great technology and all these

111
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,229
great software elements have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a use in</font>

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,229
the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but there's some things</font>

113
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:37,378
that we need to fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> too it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font>

114
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:39,750
there yet so my research is in

115
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:43,409
information security and organizations

116
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,400
working with victims of violence when I

117
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:50,849
had to pick my dissertation topic I went

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,948
back and I read the essay that I had to

119
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:56,339
write in order to be able to be accepted

120
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,979
at Purdue and I wrote about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I wanted</font>

121
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">to help victims of stalking obviously</font>

122
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,008
right that's where I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

123
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:07,349
would be waving the flag and this may

124
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,389
when I was challenged with my prelim

125
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,339
exams which became part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

126
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,460
foundation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dissertation research</font>

127
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:17,279
I decided that I don't want to be in the

128
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,400
victims face anymore it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not where my</font>

129
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,020
head's at I've moved far beyond it but

130
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,659
what I did realize is that the

131
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,020
organizations that I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for help</font>

132
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:30,960
and the organizations that I now partner

133
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,969
with in some respects what I'm seeing

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,099
with them is that they are really

135
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:37,710
struggling with information security

136
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,930
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really struggling with how do I</font>

137
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,169
manage everything that's out there on

138
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,550
the internet about our organization and

139
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,639
so I did some digging around and I

140
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,099
realized like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my god there's a ton of</font>

141
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,430
research out there about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how victims use</font>

142
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,500
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can find a research</font>

143
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,450
on

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,310
how victims of domestic violence use

145
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,979
technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their abusers can find</font>

146
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,320
them how victims of human trafficking

147
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,050
around social media there's tons of

148
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,860
research on the victim side there's no

149
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,590
research right now right now hence the

150
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now there's no research looking at</font>

organizations nonprofit organizations

152
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,419
working with victims of violence and how

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,020
they're managing information security oh

154
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,640
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god we have a whole population of</font>

155
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,859
organizations out there in the world you

156
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,620
guys that have no idea all the great

157
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,440
work that you guys talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here at</font>

158
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,870
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they don't understand it and</font>

159
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,820
frankly they're afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so my</font>

160
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,760
research is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font>

161
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,030
but I have to do as my committee so

162
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,099
dutifully told me in August when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

165
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,140

166
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world i'm going to make every</font>

168
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,780
violence safe and they said Kelly we

169
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:07,880
have one thing for you get the degree go

170
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,349
save the world not the reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I'm</font>

171
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,479
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you some insights of what</font>

172
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,930
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been learning along the way but</font>

173
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,659
it's all centered around this idea and

174
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,690
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in case a if you are interested in</font>

175
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,310
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to stick a statistic 20</font>

176
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,810
people per minute fall victim to

177
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,240
physical violence by an intimate partner

178
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,040
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the victims of these</font>

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,200
horrible crimes aren't going away and

180
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,210
therefore the organizations that are

181
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:37,729
chartered to help them are also growing

182
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:39,560
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be mindful of that so just</font>

183
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:41,390
like any researcher and<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody who's</font>

184
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,890
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at information security first</font>

185
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,650
thing you want to do or one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

186
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:50,770
things is to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk landscape</font>

187
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:53,449
right pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard stuff for</font>

188
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,220
nonprofits and for organizations working

189
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,760
with victims of violence their business

190
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,740
right they have general concerns around

191
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,569
information security just like any other

192
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,790
business would have they also have

193
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,190
communication channels they talk to

194
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to legal professionals they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to the</font>

195
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,450
courts they talk to other advocates they

196
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,030
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> with victims they have to be on</font>

197
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">call in some cases 24-7 to deal with</font>

198
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,010
victims so they have communication

199
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,430
channels that also put them at risk they

200
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,580
also have imagined a victim walking into

201
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:38,989
a crisis organization carrying her<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

202
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone right there's a privacy risk lots</font>

203
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,910
of these organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> are totally</font>

204
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:48,830
unaware that using Dropbox might not be

205
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:52,089
the best idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> or communicating over open</font>

206
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:56,270
channels may not be the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

207
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:58,100
because malicious actors in this in this

208
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,170
context of these organizations which

209
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:08,750
I'll talk about in a minute are very

210
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:12,110
very motivated fundraising fundraising

211
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,480
is critical to any organization that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

212
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,880
serving victims or any nonprofit for

213
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that matter right most nonprofits are</font>

214
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,710
either funded by grants by endowments by

215
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,089
other big financial institutions but

216
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,670
they're also funded by personal

217
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,680
donations<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay many of the</font>

218
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization's down looking at rely</font>

219
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,140
heavily on just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the five dollar</font>

220
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,850
donation the ten dollar donation the

221
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,860
hundred dollar donation but you need a

222
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of those to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to sustain an</font>

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,460
organization the other part of the risk

224
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,140
landscape for these organizations are

225
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,750
the digital documents everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

226
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:51,500
becoming electronic now there aren't so

227
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,960
many paper files right even in the court

228
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,120
system everything is becoming electronic

229
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,550
so these organizations have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

230
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,710
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage that have to</font>

231
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,040
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is secure and what's not</font>

232
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,960
secure from two sides of it right from

233
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,790
the traffic or not the traffic but from

234
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,680
the flow the information of those

235
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,959
digital documents but also from the

236
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">content so when I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font>

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,459
organizations the first thing they say

238
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,709
to me

239
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:24,959
who would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack us I'm hoping</font>

240
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">you all recognize Monty Python and the</font>

241
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,518
Holy Grail right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a very</font>

242
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:32,490
serious topic but doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we can't</font>

243
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,199
a little humor along the way but in all

244
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriousness these organizations are</font>

245
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,240
stepping back and saying you know what

246
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these victims I've got these</font>

survivors of human trafficking walking

248
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,329
into our organization saying help me I

249
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:51,179
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about anybody else that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want to attack us so here's</font>

abusers<font color="#E5E5E5"> into traffickers those who want</font>

254
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,740
to control the victim these are highly

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">motivated people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some of these</font>

256
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,829
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very tech-savvy doesn't mean</font>

257
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,689
that an abuser is in a technology

258
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:14,790
specialism an abuser can be an

259
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:19,589
information security specialist right

260
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:24,029
men and women but if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

261
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:28,049
every time a woman or a man walks into

262
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,429
domestic violence agency with their cell

263
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:33,679
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're bringing their attacker</font>

264
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,959
into that environment potentially right

265
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,610
there's a huge number of cases where

266
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are walking into these</font>

267
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:48,480
organizations with infected malware on

268
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:51,118
their phones hackers just last week I

269
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,220
was at an organization in Cambridge that

270
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:55,470
I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enlist to get their</font>

271
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,740
database to help in my research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

272
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,619
graciously said yes whatever we can do

273
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,119
the to participate would be great in the

274
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:05,939
course of the conversation with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

275
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:07,619
organization they said oh well this is

276
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:10,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">really interesting you're here Kelly we</font>

277
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:15,600
just had a DDoS attack last month I'm

278
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:17,579
like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that and</font>

279
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,059
they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we have a third party</font>

280
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:23,719
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they told us I said oh and</font>

281
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,399
what happened there like we don't know I

282
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,339
said who do you think did it we have no

283
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,579
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be done to protect yourself</font>

284
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">against it in</font>

285
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:35,258
future nothing we think the third party

286
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,939
vendor might be doing something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

287
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:41,230
don't know the other same conversation

288
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,498
with this organization by the way

289
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,670
they're phenomenal they're highly

290
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:48,699
successful in the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

291
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,519
doing to combat human trafficking but on

292
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,498
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side they told me that they</font>

293
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,499
were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a hackathon coming up</font>

294
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,869
and they're really excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font>

295
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:00,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

296
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:03,610
them until<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started asking questions</font>

297
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,618
and I said oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> great what are you going</font>

298
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,170
to try and capture in this hackathon and

299
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:10,540
they say well we want to get all of the

300
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,329
contact information of the traffickers

301
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,738
and the pimps off of their phones we

302
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,258
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to hack into the phones</font>

303
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:19,029
get all their contact information so we

304
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,889
can start bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> down their businesses</font>

305
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because this organization is all</font>

306
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,670
about bringing<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the businesses and</font>

307
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:30,429
not necessarily direct services to

308
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:32,259
victims I say oh that's cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay have</font>

309
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,389
you been advertising oh yeah we're

310
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,980
advertising all over social media we're

311
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:39,249
advertising all these places and I'm

312
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,279
like oh but seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys my head</font>

313
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:45,639
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to explode and I I will never</font>

314
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:47,949
play poker with anyone because I truly

315
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,160
cannot have a poker face so I'm going

316
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:54,910
holy cow holy cow holy cow I said all

317
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">right have you done anything to step up</font>

318
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">your security have you talked to your</font>

319
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:02,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party IT folks you know what are</font>

320
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,410
you doing oh well we never really

321
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:08,229
thought about that nice so well you know

322
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,829
the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also on social media</font>

323
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,540
and the bad guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably watching</font>

324
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,279
what you're doing consuming you just had

325
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,319
a DDoS attack I'm sure there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

326
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">in particular or group that's</font>

327
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,128
particularly watching you the human

328
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,769
trafficking organizations are of

329
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:26,439
particular interest because of their

330
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,480
political positions especially some of

331
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:31,959
the more international organizations

332
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,249
combating human trafficking but hackers

333
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:38,018
are not you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is part of</font>

334
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:39,939
their landscape this is part of who the

335
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,810
malicious actors are for these

336
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,209
organizations

337
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,189
then the other one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little bit</font>

338
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,170
more benign<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so important for them to</font>

339
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,840
realize is the data data mining

340
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,000
attackers some of these nonprofit

341
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,220
organizations are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well funded and</font>

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,500
they're well-funded sometimes by wealthy

343
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,470
people wouldn't be interesting for

344
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,880
somebody to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to capture the names</font>

345
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,680
and addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> of donors the other thing</font>

346
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,920
that I mentioned to these organizations

347
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,589
is what if you have were attacked just

348
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,709
by getting your database of your victims

349
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,600
and they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well their names are</font>

350
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,100
out there anyway or their public records

351
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,920
they came the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of danced around the</font>

352
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,279
question and I said but what that might

353
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,380
do is actually compromise the trust that

354
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,480
the community and that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

355
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:36,939
you serve have in your organization if

356
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:38,950
you can't protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself so what's</font>

357
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,160
also unique about these organizations

358
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,620
because what I've been taught as and now

359
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,469
I can't even call myself a researcher

360
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,720
yet I think I'm a researcher light when

361
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,060
I finish my degree on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> vehicle full</font>

362
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,700
researcher but the beautiful thing about

363
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,609
this PhD process besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the gray</font>

364
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,890
hair on my head is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to see</font>

365
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,930
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the business side and from a</font>

366
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:04,000
research side so I'm looking deeper into

367
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,389
what these organizations what makes them

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,069
unique so priority<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for them it's</font>

369
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,530
always about servicing the victims that

370
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,199
walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> into their their organizations</font>

371
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,060
right or that contact them that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

372
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,980
be priority one thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

373
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:23,099
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is not their</font>

374
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,099
priority sad but it's not their priority

375
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,410
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be playing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal</font>

376
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:34,629
sandbox all the time court records are

377
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:37,720
public my soccer was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

378
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,000
details of the restraining order that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

379
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,460
filed against him and get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

380
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,950
daughter's school because those records

381
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,010
are public so they have to fit also

382
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:55,200
within that arena that has its own

383
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,200
issues around information security

384
00:17:55,539 --> 00:18:00,650
they want to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information a lot of</font>

385
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">these organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are built on</font>

386
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,480
communities they're built on communities

387
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:08,419
that want to share details and share

388
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,400
stories and how get more services to

389
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:14,750
victims so it's about sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

390
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">information they need the money as I</font>

391
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned fundraising is critical for</font>

392
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:23,210
these organizations and by the way lots

393
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are running on shoestring</font>

394
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,669
budgets so how are they surviving

395
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,039
volunteers how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you do IT support</font>

396
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:33,260
for your families I asked this<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

397
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,120
I know come on I know there's more

398
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:39,500
people in this room that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have fixed an</font>

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,289
iphone or fix a laptop right you do IT

400
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,990
support these organizations are going

401
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:47,929
out to family members and friends and

402
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,450
saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I met with Kelly</font>

403
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,130
and she scared the pants off of me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

404
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,760
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to take a look at</font>

405
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,429
this can you help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out right not to</font>

406
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,039
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that volunteers aren't great</font>

407
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,659
volunteers are awesome but you want to

408
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,210
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in these environments</font>

409
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:07,210
that is appropriate to manage the risk

410
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,520
so some of what's stolen from nonprofits

411
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this is from 2014 I'm sorry it's a</font>

412
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,830
little bit blurry because it just gives

413
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,850
you a big picture view of what's stolen

414
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:25,780
top three financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> records business</font>

415
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:31,010
documents and internal communications

416
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:33,918
for a domestic<font color="#E5E5E5"> violence abuser he or she</font>

417
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">may want to see what's being said about</font>

418
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,070
him between the victim and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the her</font>

419
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:45,820
advocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all about</font>

420
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:45,820
that that person it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about control</font>

421
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,780
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through all the</font>

422
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,820
the pieces but let me just walk you

423
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,270
through the donation processing what

424
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,908
I've discovered in my research so far

425
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:01,340
again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on the radar at all I</font>

426
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:04,090
had an executive director<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domestic</font>

427
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,100
violence shelter sitting on my porch in

428
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,860
Boston we're having a

429
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,260
conversation about my<font color="#E5E5E5"> research and we're</font>

430
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,299
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really healthy conversation and</font>

431
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,240
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said to her i said if you thought</font>

432
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:20,889
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you donor database and she's like</font>

433
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,570
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said how come she's like because we</font>

434
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,520
have victims we have to serve we have a

435
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,918
domestic violence shelter that is over

436
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">filled we can't service the people in</font>

our community we have other priorities

438
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,230
so donation processing is not even on

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,990
of information security that if you had

449
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:05,049
third-party services that just on a very

broad look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my research we're like</font>

452
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:17,080
organizations processing these these

453
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:19,689
donations right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using HTTPS ok I</font>

454
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,330
know HTTPS is being widely used but it

455
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,940
has problems will we all agree the HTTPS

456
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:30,730
has problems certificate authorities yes

457
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,520
it has issues okay the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

458
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is that we're not telling</font>

459
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,780
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this that HTTPS has</font>

460
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,340
some benefits but it also has big

461
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:43,480
problems we should at least tell them

462
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,590
about the problems for controversial

463
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,330
organizations like human trafficking

464
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,399
these organizations are combating human

465
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,100
trafficking they don't have an option to

466
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,390
donate anonymously which I find really

467
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,899
interesting i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a i went to look</font>

468
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:04,809
at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> crm customer resource management</font>

469

472
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,190
project it was all community is so

473
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,678
exciting and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

474
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:17,770
seeing in the session being quiet and

475
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:19,059
listening and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they said do you have</font>

476
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:23,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">any questions and I ray</font>

477
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:26,850
my hand and I said is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

478
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:29,740
donate anonymously using this tool and

479
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:31,209
literally everyone in the room turned

480
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,749
around and looked at me like I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

481
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,749
freak they're like for nonprofits donor

482
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,070
databases that's their customer database

483
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:41,740
right that's who they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

484
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,289
reaching out to but if you're working in

485
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">an organization where sometimes people</font>

486
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:48,429
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to donate anonymously you</font>

487
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,678
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give that option right now</font>

488
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:55,090
people aren't even thinking of that the

489
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,249
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is is that most of these</font>

490
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:01,360
organizations have no idea to an attack

491
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:03,159
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach has even occurred this one</font>

492
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,129
executive director said to me she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

493
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,899
I am sure she's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a whole</font>

494
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:11,158
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits on our website from</font>

495
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:13,479
Bangladesh and we have no idea why and

496
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,399
then she said<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm a little bit</font>

497
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,990
afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if I knew why then I</font>

498
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,268
would have to do something about it and

499
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:24,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a whole nother layer to this</font>

500
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:27,070
that I don't understand so for these

501
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,258
organizations and in my perspective

502
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,999
sorry about that it's about balancing

503
00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:33,820
the technology the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

504
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:36,940
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can't just look at the</font>

505
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,408
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at a tech summer run by</font>

506
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,509
the national network to end domestic

507
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:43,990
violence and big companies Google

508
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:45,309
Facebook Twitter were all there and they

509
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,559
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing all these technical</font>

510
00:23:45,309 --> 00:23:49,240
solutions out of these organizations and

511
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,519
these organizations were sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

512
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,769
room 400 organizations with people at

513
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,330
the edge of their seats going<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

514
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,840
that's good but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

515
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:01,330
anything you just told me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

516
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,110
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the people we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

517
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,149
integrate the people into it so how do

518
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,248
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them focus on information</font>

519
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:13,178
security when technology is scary and

520
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:15,129
overwhelming most of the time when I go

521
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,570
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk to any organization the</font>

522
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:18,519
first thing I tell them is about the

523
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,519
frequent locations tracker on the

524
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:23,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">iPhones everybody in here probably knows</font>

525
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,080
that it's like five layers into the

526
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,399
settings tracks where you've been how

527
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,830
you got there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long you were</font>

528
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,879
there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that good stuff yeah that</font>

529
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,889
scares people a lot

530
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,179
because I went the organization

531
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,890
Cambridge I walked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and the guys</font>

532
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,110
like oh yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about location</font>

533
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:43,200
services the like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me show you</font>

534
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:45,809
one layer deeper and then he got scared

535
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
and I don't want to scare people but

536
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:52,649
sometimes we have to break them out of

537
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,330
their comfort zone the other thing is is

538
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,000
that these organizations are say don't

539
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">make me talk to an IT person God</font>

540
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Almighty please don't make me talk to a</font>

541
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,010
computer person don't make me talk to an

542
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,800
IT person<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Pete I'm</font>

543
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,730
not going to talk to a security person

544
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:13,200
because they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare me even</font>

545
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:15,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more it's sad what I couldn't</font>

546
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a good picture so you get the kid I</font>

547
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like it too kittens aren't dying no</font>

548
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,690
let's hope but part of why we scare

549
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:31,020
people are why our industry scares

550
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:35,370
people is because of this right pgp is

551
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">flippin scary to non-technical users ok</font>

552
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,870
never mind setting it up if somebody in

553
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,760
a crisis organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get an</font>

554
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,040
email that looked like this if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

every time I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody alpha like Oh</font>

566
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,340
the persona okay for these organizations

567
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,050
we have to help them understand that

568
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,689
information security isn't about hackers

569
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:27,120
all the time right it's part of the

570
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:33,240
equation but information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is</font>

571
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:35,100
much broader and we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help so</font>

572
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,500
these crisis organizations are using

573
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,760
technology every day they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on social</font>

581
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:58,480
media site and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way what about</font>

582
00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:01,299
your security risk so they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

583
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,519
understand what risks that they're

584
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,639
incorporating or what they're taking on

585
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:09,239
by using different<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies there</font>

586
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:12,100
are crisis organizations that have

587
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:15,220
advocates using their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal cell</font>

588
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,609
phones I could do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hour talk on</font>

589
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:22,869
BYOD for crisis organizations it's a big

590
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:28,119
problem but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

591
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:30,269
we can do to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them again IT support</font>

592
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:33,009
this is redundant of earlier sorry but

593
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:35,019
it's important for people to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

594
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:37,840
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nonprofit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations either</font>

595
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:41,230
outsource their information security

596
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,539
information technology or they get

597
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:47,889
volunteers nine times out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ten and</font>

598
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:49,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not a statistical number I will</font>

599
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:55,389
have one next<font color="#CCCCCC"> year but a lot of</font>

600
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,590
organizations do use volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

601
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:59,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let me give you some examples</font>

602
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,639
of other stuff that impacts these

603
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:06,340
organizations this is an escape button

604
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:08,830
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nonprofit's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font>

605
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,830
victims of violence on their websites

606
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,949
they have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape button so that is a</font>

607
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,658
victim is on the site and their user

608
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,169
comes into the room they can exit out

609
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:23,710
quickly sound like a great plan right in

610
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:26,710
most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is really interesting it</font>

611
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,720
goes some of these sites go to CNN some

612
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,539
of them go to weather.com some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

613
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go to the Google homepage but many</font>

614
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:36,700
of them what happens is that they

615
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the the browsing</font>

616

617
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,359
the abuser all she needs to do or she

618
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:47,408
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is go through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> history</font>

619
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,960
and there it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so they're starting</font>

620
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,450
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right place by having these skate</font>

621
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,690
buttons on their websites but it's not

622

<font color="#CCCCCC">the end all be all this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the easy</font>

button<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

624
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:03,379
a lot of organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't</font>

625
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,450
understand infosec the way we do want

626
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:12,139
the easy button this for many

627
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:16,940
organizations is there easy button https

628
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:20,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did a paper on https recently and i</font>

629
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:23,600
went in into it with the mindset of if i

630
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:28,159
am an advocacy organization I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a</font>

631
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,649
victim and I want to search on something

632
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,379
and I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that HTTPS is there I'm going</font>

633
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to feel safe well as you all know we</font>

634
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:38,658
some time to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font>

635
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,908
trusted certificates right this one is

636
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:43,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">from google chrome everybody has their</font>

637
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:47,809
own of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course every browser has their</font>

own<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning I didn't pick the worst out</font>

639
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:52,100
of the bunch but google chrome is pretty

640
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:55,309
pretty interesting so if you put

641
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,199
yourselves in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

642
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:59,570
victim or an advocate in the crisis

643
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,659
organization what you would see here

644
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:06,619
first is see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big yellow triangle</font>

645
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:11,330
with the ! that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay doesn't say</font>

646
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:13,369
stop it says caution okay then it says

647
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:18,678
the site<font color="#CCCCCC"> security certificate is not</font>

648
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:21,439
trusted many non-technical users have no

649
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,299
idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate is</font>

650
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,769
like Oh what is that so if you take the

651
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,658
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you read through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like oh</font>

652
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:33,769
okay maybe this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

653
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:38,899
think about okay safari by the way has

654
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:41,090
the continue button highlighted right so

655
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,320
they automatically say continue on don't

656
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">even think about it we're just giving</font>

657
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,529
you this little warning because we have

658
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:53,238
to but at least google chrome says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

659
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:55,999
proceed<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway or go back to safety help</font>

660
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:59,330
me understand so if you have a user

661
00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's you know curious they go to this</font>

662
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,830
page holy guacamole look at what we've

663
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,409
got here we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got more technical</font>

664
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:10,999
language in this thing then many users

665
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:11,779
would even want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with right so</font>

666
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:14,479
how do we

667
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:17,210
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and other</font>

668
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:21,379
you know non-technical users really

669
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means when a</font>

670

certificate is entrusted and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

671
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:33,619
tell them that not all content on an

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges the other challenges that</font>

674
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:43,700
the crisis organizations are facing is

675
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,968
protecting privacy laws vs serving

676
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,700
victims first of all layering existing

677
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:53,089
federal and state statutes regarding

678
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,399
with technology is happening there are

679
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:58,820
some laws that are specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> geared</font>

680
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:01,070
towards technology but for example the

681
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,989
harassment laws and the stalking laws in

682
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:08,689
most states just have digital means

683
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:11,929
added into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> description so there's no</font>

clear understanding or clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> road when</font>

if it's recorded in the courts and any

00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:57,469
of the advocates at risk the good news

700
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,239
is is that many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crisis</font>

701

704
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:10,549
when I did this research a few months

705
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago but I do have one that I thought was</font>

pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good this is the National Human</font>

707
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,499
Trafficking Resource Center and what I

708
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,478
liked about it is that it talks about

709
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the use of information it talks about</font>

and

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,600
doubt policy and it just gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you more</font>

than we're going to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep you safe</font>

719
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:50,309
have it publicized on their website so

720

00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:59,970
users again what I did was I put myself

724
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,610
in the place of a crisis organization

725
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:05,520
that wanted to you know learn more about

726
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it or protect their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own privacy so I</font>

727
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,780
looked at this at these tools from a few

728
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,549
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> angles first of all what's the</font>

729
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,370
difference between privacy and anonymity

730
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and pseudonymity ok there's vast</font>

731
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:21,690
differences between those three terms is

732
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so does the tool provide</font>

733
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,830
them privacy and in a New York

734
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:30,168
pseudonymity is the tool really

735
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:32,549
untraceable or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just say they are</font>

736
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:35,219
what part of the human interaction

737
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,440
compromises the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have an</font>

738
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">example in a minute but you know anytime</font>

739
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,379
humans are in our systems they met they

740
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,350
mess things up right users mess things

741
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,989
up all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course how</font>

742
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,810
easy it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use there are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

743
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:54,719
examples of privacy protecting tools

744
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:56,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">DuckDuckGo is a great example it looks</font>

745
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">very friendly and they have a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cute</font>

747
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want to use DuckDuckGo it looks</font>

748
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:09,600
fun other tools like I quicks and stegun

look really<font color="#CCCCCC"> average users and crisis</font>

751
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,700
organizations and nonprofits may not

752
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:20,430
want to use them so here a couple of

753
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:23,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples from that research hi denis</font>

those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all evil actors in your lives</font>

average users understand what a secure

763
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,980
connection is you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> bet they</font>

764
00:35:52,890 --> 00:36:05,609
would say while<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using HTTPS that's a</font>

765
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:07,470
secure connection right Sega notes

willingly agreed to do so or by the way

770
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,920
if the FBI knocks on their door they're

771
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:27,990
going to give up their user database you

772
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,750
can't say that you're untraceable or

773
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,879
that you're totally protecting people's

774
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,670
privacy if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have loopholes like this</font>

775
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,240
my issue is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that they do</font>

776
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:41,280
this my issue as a researcher and as an

777
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,290
advocate for these organizations is

778
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,109
please tell them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what</font>

779
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,450
you're doing in a way that they get is

780
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:51,029
these types of information this type of

781
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:54,750
information is down in the terms of

782
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:58,910
agreement of course hey who reads the

783
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:02,700
terms of agreement besides geeks like me

784
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:08,640
I'm like it I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even tell you about</font>

785
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:10,350
ubers terms of agreement also<font color="#CCCCCC"> sec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font>

786
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,359
I'm I'm sorry I'm picking on them but

787
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,370
they they sort of deserve it in my mind

788
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,799
we save user data and especially

789
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,850
protected servers the axis is only made

790
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,740
available to small number of people okay

791
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:28,650
first question is who how many where are

792
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:32,189
they do I know them are they my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

796
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things some</font>

dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so even though we can</font>

802
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,700
make fun at some of this for lots of

803
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:02,880
organizations in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> space it's very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">written in their website seriously okay</font>

807
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,799
so then you've got average<font color="#E5E5E5"> user right</font>

go now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to tour and oh my</font>

use that so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we leave users</font>

817
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,760
we're kind of flying out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wind so</font>

that's built on trust can have an impact

820
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,279
for more than just the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a</font>

digital security breach for nonprofit

organization could crush them it could

823
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,200
make them go out of business and it

824
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:03,600
could defame the reputation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seek the services of some of</font>

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,130
these organizations because they don't

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they can trust them if a victim</font>

organizations that they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

833
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:31,799
are also protecting their information I

834
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,509
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking to</font>

the service providers that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping</font>

836
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:38,400
me especially the FBI I kept asking them

837
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,680
unlike what are you doing to keep me

838
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,869
protected what are you doing to protect

839
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,049
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel communication you just</font>

840
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:50,250
called me on my cell phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my</font>

841

stalker texts me on how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know him</font>

842
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:56,490
you kept safe in this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

843
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,200
questions that are starting to now

844
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:00,598
bubble up by victim

845
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,020
using these organizations so we have to

846
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about this a little bit deeper but</font>

847
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,859
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's coming out down</font>

848
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,369
the pike is that we have awesome

849
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:13,799
technologies right wearable technologies

850
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:17,849
great things super fun technologies

851
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,990
coming out right but how vulnerable are

852
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:23,910
we going to have users like this be

853
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,729
through technologies like this again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

854
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not waving the flag of let's go</font>

855
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:32,310
crawl in a hole with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my yoga mat and not</font>

856
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:34,770
use any technology ever alls I'm

857
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:37,170
suggesting is that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

858
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:40,890
the landscape of<font color="#CCCCCC"> organisations beyond</font>

859
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:43,290
just the big guys and just beyond the

860
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,180
for-profits we need to understand the

861
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,210
landscape of organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

862
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,069
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at risk so that we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have them</font>

863
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,470
bridge this understanding what

864
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:55,260
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security should be and help</font>

865
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,779
them identify maybe not fix everything

866
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,140
but at least let's identify a priority

867
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">list I had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woman at the tech</font>

868
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,379
conference at the NNA TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were seeing</font>

869
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,069
at a round table which is a lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman</font>

870
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,990
and she ran a domestic<font color="#CCCCCC"> violence</font>

871
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:15,150
organization in a tribal community and

872
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,879
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having this like little round</font>

873
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,400
table discussion and she started banging

874
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,800
her hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table and she's like</font>

875
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,550
Kelly I want the policy just give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the</font>

876
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,589
policy I'm like okay what's the problem

877
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:31,260
she's like I need a social media policy

878
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:33,328
give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I know you have them your</font>

879
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,400
researcher you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this face give me</font>

880
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:38,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policies okay well can we talk about</font>

881
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,710
this where the conversation led was that

882
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,440
she wanted to set up a Facebook page for

883
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:46,079
her organization she wasn't familiar

884
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,270
enough with the security settings with

885
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,579
facebook to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set it up</font>

886
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,099
properly she was concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

887
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,079
vulnerability that she was being her

888
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:58,650
organization and the people that she

889
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:01,109
served at risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and she wanted an</font>

890
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,540
out so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really funky</font>

891
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:07,020
happened that her board of directors

892
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,270
would not come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on her so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

893
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,259
imagine there are lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to deal</font>

894
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,480
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that one</font>

895
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,850
conversation and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that she</font>

896
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,800
wanted was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy so helping them</font>

897
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,420
break it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand and what</font>

898
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're using and why they're using it</font>

899
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:29,850
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also part of this equation and again</font>

900
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,390
as you can imagine many victims of

901
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:35,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">violence have been threatened death or</font>

902
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,950
further abuse through technology so we

903
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help keep them safe</font>

904
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,850
so what should be done because anybody

905
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,620
who's been to my talk before knows that

906
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,200
you can't walk away unless you have some

907
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,880
action items right if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

908
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,529
working on my dissertation and working

909
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,010
like crazy I want everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

910
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:56,550
working with me yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so here we</font>

911
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">go first of all can't solve problems by</font>

912
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,890
using the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things we use to</font>

913
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:04,410
create them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the world of nonprofits</font>

914
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,690
the world of crisis organizations is

915
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,370
changing as quickly as any other

916
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,520
organization when you're looking at

917
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:13,400
technology okay just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're</font>

918
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,650
serving people in the physical realm

919
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,570
does not mean that they're not dealing

920
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the security challenges in the</font>

921
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:24,030
digital realm so some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

922
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,920
I'm super<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about that I'm going</font>

923
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:28,490
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing but if anybody wants to play</font>

924
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,200
and hang out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and do these things</font>

925
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,479
I'm excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about analyzing network</font>

926
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,910
traffic and other indicators to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

927
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,890
identify security breaches the only

928
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:41,490
security breaches that I could find for

929
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:45,420
organizations in this realm was one one

930
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:49,290
or two while now too now free human

931
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,330
trafficking organizations three were the

932
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,970
only ones that reported a security

933
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,740
breach I bet there's more going on in

934
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,779
these networks and these organizations

935
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,689
are aware of so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go play and</font>

936
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:05,550
see what's happy not scaring them but at

937
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:07,980
least play I think it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

938
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start identifying in the realm of</font>

939
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,410
crisis organization existing security

940
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,940
technologies I'm not asking for anybody

941
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,220
to reinvent the wheel and to build

942
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,590
something just for nonprofits or just

943
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,410
for crisis organizations what I'm hoping

944
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,330
is that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> build using</font>

945
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,060
sisting technologies just like the

946
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:29,120
privacy protecting tools and let's map

947
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,850
that or mirror that against crisis

948
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:35,630
organizations and say hmm with this

949
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:37,970
serve them or would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not or maybe it</font>

950
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,760
serves them to this degree or maybe we

951
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:44,049
should educate them about how it serves

952
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,760
them or where they're at risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

953
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:48,140
doing that taxonomy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think would be</font>

954
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,950
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful for these</font>

955
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:53,299
organizations identify policies protocol

956
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,759
some training programs that fit the

957
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,410
culture and the needs of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofit</font>

958
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,040
my dissertation research is going to be

959
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at a national standard I had one</font>

960
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,700
picked out until I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Wendy now</font>

961
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:09,980
I'm rethinking it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh corpsman so I</font>

962
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,689
can't come to last con again until my

963
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,600
dissertation is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these</font>

964
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,480
people have derailed me a little bit but

965
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:20,330
if we take a national standard and we

966
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,250
can map where these organizations are

967
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,069
today against that maybe we can help

968
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:31,430
them move forward in all of these realms

969
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:35,660
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make IT and security not</font>

970
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:38,419
scary anymore trust me I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> two years</font>

971
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:41,990
at tour people were afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

975
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,190
doesn't have to be scary I don't want to

978
00:45:54,110 --> 00:46:00,160
you live in the space of fear and danger

00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,900
all the time I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help them</font>

981
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:14,090
that's useful and thoughtful in a

business sense and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> scared so your</font>
