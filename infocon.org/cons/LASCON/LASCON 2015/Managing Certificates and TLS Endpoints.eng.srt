1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,470
alright so today the title of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk is</font>

2
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:29,169
managing certificates and TLS<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints</font>

3
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,210
so you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inspiration for this</font>

4
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:33,190
Henry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I who's right here in the</font>

5
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,980
audience we work on the security

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,110
engineering team at Rackspace we're in

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:43,900
charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of managing a large number of</font>

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:46,030
product in points44 ssl/tls stuff so you

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we kind of have an inside look into</font>

10
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,560
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this at scale beyond you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,530
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one website whatever we</font>

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,360
have very many<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tracks so and since</font>

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,400
heartbleed everyone's kind of paying

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,820
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,320
attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a cell so all the all</font>

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,330
the little things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe you got by</font>

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,670
with in years<font color="#E5E5E5"> past where your config</font>

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,270
wasn't perfect now those are those are

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,850
heavily heavily scrutinized so many

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,350
headaches later where we have a tool

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,110
that all kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

22
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,240
more in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute but that helps us</font>

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,250
manage all the endpoints<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">dealing with so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just start with a</font>

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,960
quick very quick primer so TLS SSL you

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,300
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously used for all the good</font>

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,330
stuff CIA confidentiality integrity and

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,390
authentication its encryption for data

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,910
in transit and so it started off there

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,330
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL v1 which was never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

31
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,190
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could install</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and run</font>

32
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,920
with it was more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a spec so what we</font>

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:52,690
have is SSL be two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and three and TLS 1</font>

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,240
11 and 12 you get it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about every</font>

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,940
device your phone is probably talking to

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,470
Google over SSL right as we talk so

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,069
there's all kinds of stuff that that's

38
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,500
using it and it's it seems very simply

39
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:07,209
get set up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's you know</font>

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,008
there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple config changes</font>

41
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:11,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get that sell very quickly</font>

42
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,599
but what we're going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about today</font>

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do once you</font>

44
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,569
get over that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step what do you</font>

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,510
have to do you know when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

46
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:23,290
managing a certificate and a server for

47
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,810
you know for a while so TLS adoption is

48
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,500
increasing browsers are starting to call

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,120
out explicitly like in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past e a</font>

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,000
regular site without SSL looked like

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,040
is just fine this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is totally cool now if</font>

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,319
you go to you know you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any site in</font>

53
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,239
firefox or chrome that doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font>

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,069
they're going to tell you about it which

55
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,780
is totally valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy about that</font>

56
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,488
but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that there's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,879
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more ssl endpoints that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

58
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start managing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so again it</font>

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,518
can't just be turned on and left alone a

60
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of times but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know at least some</font>

61
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,090
of the things you know the cost has come

62
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,190
down a lot in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk about this</font>

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,129
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later but let's encrypt</font>

64
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,269
which is a kind of a community

65
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,790
certificate authority they have actually

66
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">just gotten there first their first</font>

67
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,260
certificate trusted and they're free so

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,090
again TLS is going to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going up</font>

69
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,000
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used for obviously web</font>

70
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,250
services but email IRC all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,159
stuff epns they all they all kind of use

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,640
ssl/tls some extent so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

73
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,929
moving parts certificate authorities I

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,819
don't want to go into too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

75
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you guys probably know most of it</font>

76
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,659
but there's a lot there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little</font>

77
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,150
pieces that would have to be configured

78
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:39,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and can't just gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be left alone so</font>

79
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,829
certificate authorities protocols

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,720
ciphers all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things kind of add up</font>

81
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:48,099
to having a secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS SL entation it's</font>

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,019
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of said earlier we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

83
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,339
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple protocol versions to</font>

84
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:56,980
work with you've got certs of varying

85
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,069
you know issuing dates with with

86
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,780
different expiration dates etc so you

87
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,730
know maybe one endpoint you can kind of

88
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,440
set a little reminder and outlook for

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,108
yourself to go you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey i need to go</font>

90
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,730
renew my ssl cert you know on this day

91
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:12,639
but you're going to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very full</font>

92
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,138
calendar once you get enough of these so

93
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,690
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other you know miss</font>

94
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:20,349
configuration running on outdated

95
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:23,889
hardware having having a large number to

96
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:26,289
manage as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've said is also fun so</font>

97
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,610
intermediate certs expire so people

98
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're actually signing your cert</font>

99
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,039
sometimes that can happen certs can get

100
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,169
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know revoked for various reasons</font>

101
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,630
maybe somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked them into github</font>

102
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:41,609
oops time to delete it revoke everything

103
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,789
start over redeploy so you get that

104
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,930
you also get some every once<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while</font>

105
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:47,460
you're actually see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get</font>

106
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,960
compromised and they have to take all

107
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,719
the certs away and do it all over again

108
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,909
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fun and self signed cert</font>

109
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">spacek alee get rid of a lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

110
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:57,780
security principle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl so they're</font>

111
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of useless in a lot of ways but</font>

112
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get deployed a lot so so there's</font>

113
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">always new vulnerabilities poodle is one</font>

114
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:11,969
of many but there this is an actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font>

115
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,000
protocol itself so poodles a an attack

116
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:17,969
on sslv3 specifically you get bugs in

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,189
the actual encryption software basically

118
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,379
as you can already<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell right the point</font>

119
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,000
of this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delve deep into a lot</font>

120
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:26,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these different issues right it's</font>

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to simply say that there are a</font>

122
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,710
large number of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for which you</font>

123
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,860
will have to renew your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl certificates</font>

124
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,258
change the configuration etc regulation

125
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,930
compliance so TLS v1 is going to be

126
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,520
deprecated for PCI at some point and

127
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,650
sha-1 signed certificates are flagged as

128
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,378
insecure if they're signed through

129
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,839
january first 2017 and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browsers</font>

130
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,339
telling you about it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

131
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,860
maybe you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sense now of how</font>

132
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,930
we all feel about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right a little</font>

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,240
little humor to brighten things up right

134
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,800
so there's a large number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

135
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,379
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong but the idea here is that</font>

136
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,240
like eventually you can get it all under

137
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,089
control and it's it's normal it's fine

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,310
it's normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

139
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:14,969
cipher so just quickly brushing over

140
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,710
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically when when connecting</font>

141
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:18,150
the client had server have to agree on

142
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,029
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

143
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,438
and unfortunate well kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of from a</font>

144
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,729
security perspective it's a little

145
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,409
unfortunate that the client can

146
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:29,099
essentially dictate the terms under

147
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:31,259
which this is this takes place because

148
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:32,729
they they can essentially say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only</font>

149
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,430
support one thing do you support that

150
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,800
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font>

151
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,979
this one other thing now and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

152
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,039
basically go along a list of insecure

153
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:46,050
and you know it's bad ciphers and that's

154
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,300
that's kind of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens in in the</font>

155
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:51,449
log jam attack where a<font color="#E5E5E5"> man in the middle</font>

156
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,190
can actually force the force<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font>

157
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:54,740
to connect to the server over an

158
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,740
insecure

159
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:02,460
channel basically again very simple

160
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,870
simplified here so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what this is</font>

161
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,448
what you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be familiar with you know</font>

162
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you've dug into setting up engine X</font>

163
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,300
or anything like that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set different</font>

164
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,220
ciphers SSL cybers this long string here

165
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,199
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a meaning it's not just</font>

166
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,160
a bunch of in cahaba incomprehensible

167
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,780
words so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit here is your your</font>

168
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,419
key exchange algorithm so this would be

169
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,000
elliptical diffie-hellman you've got

170
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,820
your authentication algorithm which this

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,900
one's RSA and then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> your key</font>

172
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,120
attributes so aes-128<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit CBC mode and</font>

173
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,810
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got your Mac hash algorithm</font>

174
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,030
at the end I don't want to get too

175
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,820
divisive on this but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

176
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,469
I feel and I'm sure lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people</font>

177
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,479
have different opinions about it there

178
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,750
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun elliptic curve things</font>

179
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,360
that you could support<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have varying</font>

180
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,599
supporting clients so you can you can go

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,130
way down this rabbit hole the things on

182
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left there are pretty sane and</font>

183
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,889
pretty agreed upon again you can go a

184
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,840
lot further you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go a lot less but it</font>

185
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,150
kind of depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> who what clients are</font>

186
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,979
you going to support if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have if you</font>

187
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to as part of your business support</font>

188
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,479
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> old hardware or really old</font>

189
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,740
operating systems it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font>

190
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,000
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use some of the stuff</font>

191
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,370
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not totally comfortable with</font>

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in general you should be pretty good</font>

193
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,030
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as you tend towards the stuff on</font>

194
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,289
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side of this so that's not</font>

195
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,448
all you have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

196
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:34,260
configuration things to to worry about

197
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:37,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">so again you know that table but but</font>

198
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,578
this also mentions openssl so you want

199
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,449
to you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be up to date on your</font>

200
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:43,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of openssl that was the</font>

201
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,680
everybody remembers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fun time that we</font>

202
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,979
had in April last year that's heart

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,609
bleeds so we we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be running the</font>

204
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,560
newest openssl unfortunately it seems

205
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:59,130
that the ssl landscape is further

206
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,430
fragmenting so update your openssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> g and</font>

207
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,310
you TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> libre SSL boring ssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the</font>

208
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,609
other ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

209
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,839
let's see yeah sometimes you're kind of

210
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately hardware sometimes put you</font>

211
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,920
in a bad spot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware</font>

212
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,480
load balancers or firewalls that don't

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,939
support the protocols or ciphers that

214
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,490
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support so sometimes you</font>

215
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,380
can't even go in there and just you know

216
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,820
twiddle some bits in your configuration

217
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,610
sometimes you got to call your hardware

218
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,010
provider which is unfortunate when that

219
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,620
happens in the out like I mentioned

220
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,689
sometimes you know the business wants to

221
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,040
support ie6 and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to support</font>

222
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,540
ie6 and that comes with compromises so

223
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,040
here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of configuration I</font>

224
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,750
won't go too far into this other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

225
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,569
just kind of show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what you're</font>

226
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">dealing with you know there's there's</font>

227
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,990
more there's more in-depth examples of

228
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,180
this and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this a bit but</font>

229
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,230
there's a great site called<font color="#CCCCCC"> cypher list</font>

230
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,459
and they have configurations for lots of

231
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:01,770
different things so yeah you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

232
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,029
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just hammering at</font>

233
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,350
home you can get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things wrong</font>

234
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:09,060
right so CA bundles ciphers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor</font>

235
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">cypher order is is worth mentioning</font>

236
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's talking about how</font>

237
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,850
essentially when those clients and

238
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,430
servers are negotiating how they're

239
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,160
going to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other honor cypher</font>

240
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,709
order says generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to use like</font>

241
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,780
as the server saying generally I want to

242
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:30,390
use the things that I have have chosen

243
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,770
let's see oh and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fun one if</font>

244
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,390
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> several servers and a load</font>

245
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,370
balancing let's say in a round-robin

246
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,839
configuration or something you hit it

247
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first time everything looks great</font>

248
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,010
it's all wonderful and then you get some

249
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,589
some reports from somebody that oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

250
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,540
actually you know I looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and you</font>

251
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting this horrible you know</font>

252
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,110
export create encryption whatever so you

253
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,800
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that all the servers</font>

254
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,220
have been to picture the same way

255
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,870
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward secrecy is another fun</font>

256
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,240
fun thing that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can enable so</font>

257
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the idea what this is to</font>

258
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">prevent a compromise of the ssl private</font>

259
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,850
key from being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to be used to go</font>

260
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,650
back in decrypt sessions that have

261
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,300
already been encrypted with it so you

262
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,490
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> state level actors if they're</font>

263
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,099
sucking up all this data if they ever

264
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,770
get your key they can go back in

265
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,470
read everything but the idea here is you

266
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,060
use ephemeral keys that are used for

267
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,880
shorter lengths of time and that you

268
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,510
can't get back from the private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key to</font>

269
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,270
those ephemeral keys strict Transport

270
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,550
Security is something in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web realm</font>

271
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,530
so this basically tells your browser hey

272
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,630
this site should only ever be on SSL

273
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,730
don't hit it on anything else we good

274
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,100
cool and then your browser basically

275
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,110
from then on knows that at no point

276
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">should anyone tell me that I should be</font>

277
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:53,280
hitting this on port 80 without SSL I

278
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,790
always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to head ssl so so let's just</font>

279
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">go over some of the vulnerabilities</font>

280
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,170
heartbleed was kind of a wake-up call

281
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:05,460
I'm sure for for more than just me in

282
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,490
this audience that was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that was</font>

283
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,350
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would characterize is a bad day</font>

284
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,180
and then we got you know we've gotten

285
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,310
several since then that haven't they've

286
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,689
all they've all wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad big</font>

287
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,359
and bad as heartbleed but they haven't

288
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:20,370
quite wowed us as much but there's a

289
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,350
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's things that</font>

290
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,940
poodle affecting ssl<font color="#CCCCCC"> three there's an</font>

291
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,640
anachronism of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> american system which</font>

292
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,840
is the the export ciphers which which

293
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,250
were kind of rediscovered this year so

294
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,560
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there's a mechanism for</font>

protecting against TLS downgrading<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

296
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,510
won't go too much into it again but

297
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:46,370
essentially this is just to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

298
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,920
sort of monkeying with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

299
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:54,570

300
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:57,410
for TLS so export ciphers are a fun fun

301
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:01,680
thing that are still around<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we had</font>

302
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,420
laws at some point excuse me saying that

303
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,890
essentially you couldn't export crypto

304
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,530
if it was a certain level of strength

305
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,210
more or less and so what they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

306
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,010
agreed on was you could use these really

307
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,620
short keys and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay right</font>

308
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you would have what they consider to</font>

309
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,120
be sort of civilian level encryption but

310
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,670
the government always knowing that they

311
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,290
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably break it right and so if</font>

312
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ever see for instance if you're if</font>

313
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,260
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your ciphers or</font>

314
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,840
whatever you're testing an endpoint and

315
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,819
you see export you don't want it you

316
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want it at all we're not under</font>

317
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,310
that

318
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,530
that that legal restriction anymore so

319
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,630
get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it throw it away if you're</font>

321
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,820
throw it away we don't need it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

322
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,770
this might be kind of what you're

323
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,470
thinking at this point like it seems

324
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,689
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot right I mean I thought I just</font>

325
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:52,020
kind of plugged in my certificate and

326
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,900
was ready to go but certs expired

327
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,350
servers are reconfigured if you're in a

out fairly fairly frequently whether in

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,100
the protocol or in the actual software

334
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,830
and you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the slow march of</font>

00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,360
time goes on we get better computers as

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,400
we get better computers we kind of have

<font color="#E5E5E5">read you know rework all these</font>

years of oh well sha-1 may not be

to keep sliding backwards so to drive

347
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,860
home once again you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to constantly</font>

348
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,110
monitor your endpoints it's like

349
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,180
constantly like all the time all<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

350
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,490
every day I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this like I</font>

351
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,000
have other stuff to do SSL is not at the

352
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of my list here so we've got a</font>

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple tools thankfully that you can use</font>

354
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,349
this is mostly getting geared towards

355
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,660
the the unix linux folks but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl</font>

356
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,150
s client is is actually pretty great for

357
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,719
just debugging stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't it's not</font>

358
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,189
security focused it's purely for getting

359
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,650
the raw information it will give you

360
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,570
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> information about as the handshakes</font>

361
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,370
happening it will monitor that traffic

362
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,690
it can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a lot of detail</font>

363
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:27,180
there test<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL about SH is one of my</font>

364
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,670
favorites personally it's it's a free

365
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,819
command-line tool you can read that but

366
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,490
basically it has no setup it has very

367
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,170
few dependencies other than openssl you

368
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,990
can just spin it up on any box basically

369
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:42,660
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux box and run it and it's ready</font>

370
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go and it's it's more security</font>

371
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,680
focused so

372
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,390
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of see this that could fit</font>

373
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,069
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen shot in here but you</font>

374
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,880
can kind of see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got you know</font>

375
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,529
ssl b2 b3 not offered that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

376
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,170
you've kind of got it'll tell you a

377
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,550
little bit about you know what the you

378
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,410
know what the good what the good

379
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,599
configuration looks like and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

380
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,010
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything if you know something</font>

381
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,670
is enabled it shouldn't be it'll tell

382
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:10,519
you it's handy and then we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis</font>

383
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,130
ssl ads so many of you are probably

384
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with this one it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very popular</font>

385
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this point and actually we utilize it</font>

386
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:22,130
for the the TLS manager that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

387
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,899
soon but basically they they hope you

388
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,610
condense all this information down and

389
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,260
they give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a nice little score and</font>

390
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,490
score is really handy if you're if

391
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,709
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> passing this off of somebody that</font>

392
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't care about ssl but you hand them</font>

393
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,579
a big red f they know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

394
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,560
the big red f right they might not know

395
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,790
what it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away from big red f</font>

396
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,079
but they know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want the big</font>

397
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,410
red f so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of how the the</font>

398
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,000
score system breaks down you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

399
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,800
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of debate some of this</font>

400
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,839
stuff maybe this is more important than

401
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,010
that but in general it's a pretty good

402
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,360
picture of if you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> an a-plus</font>

403
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,700
you're pretty good right there maybe

404
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,810
maybe a little nitpicky things you can

405
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,940
change here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there but if you're at</font>

406
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,579
an A+ like for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> intents and purposes</font>

407
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,809
you're pretty good but then it goes all

408
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,480
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to f you know like i said</font>

409
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> md5 or you know you're</font>

410
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,290
using you know 768 bit keys or something

411
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,030
or you're you know maybe only ssl to or

412
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,889
you know something like that then it'll

413
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,050
it'll very explicitly tell you that

414
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:25,850
that's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> so every once and a right</font>

415
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:27,678
you want an a you want an A+ so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

416
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,659
another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cypher list I kind of</font>

417
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up earlier but they have they</font>

418
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,830
have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good configurations for a</font>

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,690
something about ssl they have something

424
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that but you know you have to go</font>

425
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:52,429
fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> postfix and you know that's not</font>

426
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:53,660
that's not as widely distributed so you

427
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,200
know it's helpful for making

428
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,149
recommendations product teams but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

429
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,539
we'll have this one little caveat so a

430
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:04,039
copy and paste part is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice but</font>

431
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,750
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send it off to all your devs</font>

432
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,789
i would go take a look at it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

433
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,070
sure it's actually what you want because

434
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,570
there you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make trade-offs like</font>

435
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

436
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,590
clients are that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

437
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:18,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and so this this list these these</font>

438
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,870
these configurations are geared towards

439
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,299
giving you reasonable compatibility with

440
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,620
again some security<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off so you</font>

441
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:26,629
just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for yourself whether</font>

442
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,590
that's reasonable for for what you're

443
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:31,789
trying to support but you know in a lot

444
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,860
of cases if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use a</font>

445
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,450
copy and paste format you don't want it

446
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,340
to be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the implementer has</font>

447
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,899
to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like twiddle you know little</font>

448
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">bits here and there like you want it to</font>

449
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:45,500
just kind of work and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

450
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful for that that ssl is as i love</font>

451
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,510
it honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's pretty simple but</font>

452
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,460
basically they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of a bunch</font>

453
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of subdomains set up off of their site</font>

454
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,029
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to the bad ssl site</font>

455
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:58,070
they've got them all listed there but

456
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,809
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to test so if you've</font>

457
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">got some tools or whatever that you're</font>

458
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,559
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on I mean trying to make</font>

459
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:05,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that you know they catch this issue</font>

460
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">or that issue they've pretty much got</font>

461
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:09,230
every way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get an ssl cert</font>

462
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,570
wrong they've got they've got an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

463
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">point for you to test on so it's handy</font>

464
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,850
handy handy for that so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Putin</font>

465
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,529
laughing at you for wanting to manage

466
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,719
all those endpoints manually maybe none

467
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:23,960
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do but if you do this is what he</font>

468
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,389
thinks of it anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what this</font>

469
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,779
is what we use in our team to kind of

470
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:31,100
keep up with some of this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font>

471
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:32,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video of it in a second but you can</font>

472
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,830
kind of get the idea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we've</font>

473
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">got all these endpoints that are</font>

474
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,000
associated with a product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on</font>

475
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:43,100
the side you've got that helpful ssl

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,260
labs score so what what TLS manager does

477
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,000
for you is once you've kind of set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

478
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,059
all the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and end points that you</font>

479
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,860
want to test you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan them daily you</font>

480
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,510
could scan them weekly you can scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

481
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,539
monthly whenever you feel like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

482
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,070
to and it will tell you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl</font>

483
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,980
vulnerabilities that it finds as a

484
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,529
result of that scan it'll tell you when

485
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,139
certs are about to expire it'll email so

486
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:09,590
the other nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's it helps</font>

487
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,840
you be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even lower touch excuse me you</font>

488
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,309
can

489
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,689
not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put in the product owners</font>

490
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,360
email addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will actually</font>

491
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,309
send automated reports to the specific

492
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,928
product owner if you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

493
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:22,220
it keeps a history of<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything so that</font>

494
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:26,100
you can kind of track things over time

495
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:31,169
so let's hope and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pray that the video</font>

496
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,699
works sweet so right now we're just kind

497
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,120
of on the on the main page so you can

498
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,350
see we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple bad ssl endpoints</font>

499
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,928
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not scoring very well</font>

500
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:44,250
because they're bad obviously so you can

501
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,020
sort you can sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> by any of these</font>

502
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,760
different fields so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

503
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out you know when was what's the</font>

504
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,080
oldest you know what's the thing that we

505
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,209
we checked least<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent their most</font>

506
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,189
recently whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can check the</font>

507
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,940
scores out so how many how many failing

508
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:03,870
certs do we have etc so you can go to

509
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,460
the details<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this will tell you what</font>

510
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,620
specifically gave it that score what's

511
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,140
wrong with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that made it you know made</font>

512
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,299
it in half whatever and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

513
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did over time so you can see you</font>

514
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,830
know let's say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example that that</font>

515
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,220
somebody just did a deploy and oops we

516
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,899
you know fat fingered a config option or

517
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,850
we forgot to ship this config or

518
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:26,039
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well we were</font>

519
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting an A until you know this day and</font>

520
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,149
then something<font color="#E5E5E5"> went wrong so you can</font>

521
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,090
kind of go back and that helps you trace

522
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:37,979
back what it is that may be caused

523
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:40,559
caused things to go wrong for you so I

524
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's about it on this you can</font>

525
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,860
see on the side there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

526
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,279
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff that you can that you can</font>

527
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,289
do here so setting up a product etc I

528
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,710
think you guys probably get the point so

529
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:56,730
I'll go ahead and move on so you can go

530
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:59,760
get it on aunty on github on the rack or

531
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:02,460
lab / TLS manager it's apache license

532
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,908
and pull requests are more than welcome

533
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think there's probably room for us to</font>

534
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,529
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> more ssl tests and stuff like</font>

535
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,529
that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said we're mostly working</font>

536
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:16,710
off of the the qualys ssl labs api right

537
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:19,340
now but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most part it covers</font>

538
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,880
almost everything so

539
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,439
so let's uh just just to kind of tie

540
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,630
this into real life right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

541
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,280
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've said so far is kind</font>

542
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:33,440
of in an imagination land a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

543
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,850
so there's there's uh there was an

544
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
announcement let's see I guess it's been

545
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:41,060
a couple days now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but google has decided</font>

546
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of their products chromium etc</font>

547
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android everything they're going to</font>

548
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,280
ditch openssl they're going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

549
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:51,470
boring ssl why does that matter what you

550
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,960
know why do we care about that well as

551
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,670
the you know you can you can say what

552
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,010
you like about how openssl has been

553
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,390
managed over the years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

554
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,640
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> code base that everyone in this room</font>

555
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contributed to and reads frequently</font>

556
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,890
you know if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a beast</font>

557
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know as we start as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we start</font>

558
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,640
fragmenting the landscape<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just</font>

559
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,000
adding more and more and more potential

560
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,890
for things to go wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,090
you know it's potentially a good thing

562
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,460
right i mean you getting rid of some

563
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,590
cruft basically their idea is to take

564
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the little pieces of openssl that they</font>

565
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,550
want and rebuild everything else and so

566
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,400
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has potential to be good it</font>

567
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,260
also has potential to go but go wrong

568
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,660
and the more the more ssl

569
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,430
implementations and so on that are out

570
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,320
there the fewer people that you're going

571
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:43,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have looking at any individual one of</font>

572
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,350
them so you know maybe a win maybe a

573
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,120
loss but it's another thing that changed

574
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,260
and this is all stuff that's changed

575
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,199
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started working on this</font>

576
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,420
presentation so this isn't you know the

577
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,660
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> year in ssl this is like the last</font>

578
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple weeks so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned this</font>

579
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,880
briefly earlier but let's encrypt which

580
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,399
is a free CA for for issuing ssl

581
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,920
certificates they just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this week</font>

582
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,530
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> their first certificate trusted by</font>

583
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the major browsers and so what</font>

584
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,240
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to do is you know they've</font>

585
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">been they've been kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of spinning up on</font>

586
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,200
this for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while but they're finally at</font>

587
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,040
the point where they were to hand you a

588
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,020
certificate through their process they

589
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,250
don't they don't have at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

590
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe they've gotten away I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

591
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,960
think they have any other dependencies

592
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,389
they are trusted so they can start

593
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,859
ripping off search whenever they want

594
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:37,689
basically that's probably a good thing

595
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a good thing</font>

596
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:43,739
there's a you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good that</font>

597
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:46,209
there's more ssl ssl sites you know

598
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:48,759
personally I use an extension called

599
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:50,979
HTTPS Everywhere so this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me very</font>

600
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,589
happy because I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I go to a site</font>

601
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:56,259
and even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I when I try they have no</font>

602
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,570
ssl right so this this just lowers the

603
00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:00,700
the barrier to entry but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

604
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:07,749
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we were saying earlier more</font>

605
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:11,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSL and points to manage right so sha-1</font>

606
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:13,929
is totally broken everyone scream and go

607
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:15,459
crazy well so this this was a was a

608
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:19,269
paper that came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that essentially</font>

609
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:21,639
said like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said earlier the sha-1 sort</font>

610
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:24,190
of deadline of who it's it's very scary

611
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:26,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">after this point that deadline just</font>

612
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,959
keeps seeming to move back a little bit

613
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,440
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more and so this is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

614
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:34,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce Schneier blog they've</font>

615
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,149
got a they've got a full paper about it

616
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:40,950
but essentially the thing is they were

617
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:43,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a collision in the</font>

618
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,709
compression system of the algorithm I'm

619
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to stand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend like</font>

620
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,129
I know exactly what these guys are

621
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:51,639
talking about but what I can tell you is

622
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:54,998
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people see this and they go ah</font>

623
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:57,218
you know they go crazy but but really

624
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:59,349
what this means is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sha-1</font>

625
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:01,450
window for browser trust and everything

626
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,879
else it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving back and so I</font>

627
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,529
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to highlight at the end just just</font>

628
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:07,839
to kind of dial it back a little bit

629
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,700
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> line is free start collisions like</font>

630
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,879
the one presented here do not directly

631
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,259
imply a collision for sha-1 so you know

632
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,579
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you know you don't</font>

633
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,159
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start fighting the fire today</font>

634
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:20,440
but it's it's coming it's on the horizon

635
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,849
we can see it from far away we can't

636
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,259
tell when it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get here but</font>

637
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:27,428
it's getting here quicker than we

638
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:29,079
thought so yeah always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun then you have</font>

639
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,149
the diffie-hellman apocalypse which

640
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:34,779
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down on us and the</font>

641
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:37,029
NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> has apparently broken trillions of</font>

642
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,950
encrypted web and VPN connections and

643
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,319
that it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all based on is</font>

644
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,730
essentially the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a budget big</font>

645
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:47,450
enough that they could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a computer</font>

646
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:51,200
could maybe break diffie-hellman and so

647
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:53,330
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the again the assumption</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

648
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,660
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff rests on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their not</font>

649
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,399
fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never fixed and so one of</font>

650
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:01,370
the assumptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is that this</font>

651
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">is challenging is for the longest time</font>

652
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,320
basically everybody packaged up the same

653
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,820
sort of primitive pieces for

654
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,560
diffie-hellman and they'd ship it out

655
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,320
with everything right so everyone had

656
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,639
the same one but because of the way that

657
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,490
the math works and how diffie-hellman

658
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,750
works etc everyone was like yeah that's

659
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine that's cool because you're not</font>

660
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">using it directly you're using it to</font>

661
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">seed something and derive something from</font>

662
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,480
it so everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

663
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,370
was fine but what they've realized is

664
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,010
well if you have an 11 billion dollar

665
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,290
budget you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some things</font>

666
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,790
that lessen your security there a bit

667
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:39,139
and so like for example like like engine

668
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,300
X and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times</font>

669
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,760
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just come with excuse me out</font>

670
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:48,139
of the box support for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

671
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard default very widely replicated</font>

672
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,350
set of diffie-hellman parameters and

673
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,810
that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> news for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA because if</font>

674
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,340
they can build one machine this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

675
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">this all rests on they're going to build</font>

676
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,040
one machine that breaks one set of

677
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,590
parameters right so they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

678
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,690
break everything this this whole this

679
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,159
whole you know doomsday scenario relies

680
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,020
on the fact that everybody's using the

681
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,690
same diffie-hellman parameters begin

682
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,070
with it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pretty easy to</font>

683
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,460
generate your own it does take a while

684
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,020
because it needs a lot of randomness but

685
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,980
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as ours</font>

686
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,780
might have you believe so yeah these are

687
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are just like I said tying it</font>

688
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:34,310
back to the real world and very recent

689
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:37,490
history so<font color="#E5E5E5"> closing thoughts um basically</font>

690
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:39,020
it's hard right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean it's it's really</font>

691
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,080
not that hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's really just</font>

692
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,360
there's a lot of it but but if you can

693
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,280
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up on it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not it's</font>

694
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,169
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer calling you and saying oh</font>

695
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,240
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your site because</font>

696
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,940
it's broken or my browser says that it's

697
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,830
insecure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know your way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

698
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,530
ahead of it that's where you want to be

699
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,270
because at any given moment

700
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,910
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these fun things like you know</font>

701
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sha-1 or whatever can drop on you and</font>

702
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:09,260
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fight some</font>

703
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:12,170
fires so ssl/tls library bugs cipher

704
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:14,720
cipher suite bugs protocol bugs all

705
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,690
these things can happen and so it's

706
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,540
really really handy we found to manage

707
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,660
it in an automated way to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

708
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:26,389
going crazy anybody have any questions

709
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,700
and Henry I want you to come up here so

710
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:33,230
that you can you know help us do some

711
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:36,670
Q&A he's my co-presenter everybody not

712
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,670
very interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presenting</font>

713
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:49,129
everyone gets it cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right sweet oh</font>

714
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:52,100
yeah sure I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bobby speak up the</font>

715
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,410
question is could you maybe talk a

716
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,469
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ephemeral private</font>

717
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,110
keys because what we are used to using

718
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:03,980
in our environment is just private keys

719
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:07,780
in there out there with every Apache web

720
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,210
server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right employed so I</font>

721
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it in him I don't</font>

722
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,310
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of us like it yeah so what's</font>

723
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,680
the way out or yeah so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

724
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:25,790
if we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back go back in my slides a</font>

725
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:28,010
little bit get this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so if you</font>

726
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:31,159
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what this slide is calling out</font>

727
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:32,330
is essentially that on the on the cipher

728
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Suites when you're configuring your</font>

729
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,580
server or whatever so in genetics<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache</font>

730
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,340
whatever you're running the little ease

731
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,220
at the end are supposed to signify that

732
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,570
that use uses ephemeral keys so it's

733
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have</font>

734
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do anything super special to generate</font>

735
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,250
new keys it's something that's kind of

736
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,780
handled on its own and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

737
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">look out for those ciphers if that's</font>

738
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:00,350
with all that you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support then I</font>

739
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:03,379
believe actually ssl labs and some of

740
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,540
the other ssl tools and tell you if

741
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,210
perfect forward secrecy is enabled if

742
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,240
there are ciphers that support it and

743
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,590
you can you can kind

744
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,850
go through the list and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

745
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of them do if that's what you want</font>

746
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,270
to deploy unfortunately I can't get too

747
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,680
deep into the crypto on not a

748
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,320
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an expert in it but</font>

749
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,770
yeah it is actually thankfully fairly

750
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,990
easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get set up with so good stuff</font>

751
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:34,110
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> good when it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a toggle</font>

752
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:38,280
switch right anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so I have one</font>

753
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:42,060
last little bit I've been asked get to

754
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,970
the last slide here real quick so like I

755
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,190
said I work at Rackspace and I am also

756
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,220
working on the OpenStack security

757
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,410
project which is the name of kind of the

758
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,600
group that does things like

759
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,180
vulnerability management they do stuff

760
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,949
like they issue advisories if there's

761
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,010
something an OpenStack that needs a CBE

762
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,660
etc and so if any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys work with</font>

763
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:06,510
OpenStack and are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in getting</font>

764
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,000
involved come talk to me after there's

765
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,760
there's a IRC channel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

766
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,380
in touch with us on on freenode and we

767
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,210
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> weekly meetings if you want to come</font>

768
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,310
tag along and see you know kind of what

769
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,700
we're working on there's a couple cool

770
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,399
projects bandit which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python static</font>

771
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,290
analyzer and actually this might this

772
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,470
might pertain to you there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one called</font>

773
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:32,010
anchor that's for doing a femoral<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki</font>

774
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:35,160
management and so I unfortunately can't

775
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:38,190
go to too deep on that but it's it's an

776
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,660
interesting idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that got a</font>

777
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,760
mailing list as well so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

778
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,650
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said come see me or</font>

779
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,650
join<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so thank you</font>

780
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:49,850
you
