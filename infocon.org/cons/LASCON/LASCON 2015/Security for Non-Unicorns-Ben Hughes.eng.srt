00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,529
following Jack Daniel is something no

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:30,450
one really wants to do is it pretty

3
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:32,860
pleased about that hey everyone how

4

welcome last man a girl having<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font>

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,160
enjoying the conference I'm here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,170
about security with a word missing

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,750
because the projector is<font color="#CCCCCC"> four by three</font>

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:45,760
and no one expects that in 2015 quality

9
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,260
start another great start is a thang

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,610
speech<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what we're giving my damn</font>

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,870
talk during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keynote but it's worth</font>

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,940
it just to get a joint picture of your

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,940
face on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen I hate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you already</font>

14
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're just zooming in and watching you</font>

15
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,530
it's like a bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy from ghostbusters 2</font>

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,658
who just follows you around the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this clown I'm quite obviously in</font>

18
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,990
infrastructure at Global I'm quite

19
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,940
obviously from FC I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,440
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I do that</font>

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,240
defense stuff that doesn't get cool

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,170
headlines but kind of is important if

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,420
you like keeping your credit card

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,910
numbers I used to be an operations

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,380
engineer at puppet labs so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,690
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to make terrible</font>

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,089
infrastructure I in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of black</font>

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,270
t-shirts so obviously I've done some

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,490
security conferences and to prove I can

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,530
do a security ones i had a ton of

31
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,169
accounts of my unix on my high school

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,790
unix system which are literally means

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,930
I'm OG and stuff like that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:48,230
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a bunch of things</font>

35
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,630
make me sad a bunch of ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find to</font>

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,900
fix them and cope with them other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P stealing when we're down slides</font>

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,770
and then there be far too many summaries

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,300
and then we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and write on a mechanical</font>

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:05,000
bull what I'm foreign I don't understand

41
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:09,679
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that frankly mechanics all balls</font>

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,170
both of them so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of Echo</font>

43
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,840
one this is it like does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sound like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

44
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:19,510
sonic youth album to anyone else you I'm

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,830
English you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want me singing</font>

46
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,140
probably more more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want me</font>

47
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,300
dancing<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave the mic down that doesn't</font>

48
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:32,708
get it further than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speakers p I've</font>

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:36,230
worked in your talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright whatever so</font>

50
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,239
security is furious pretty important to

51
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,980
us all as I think everyone has talked

52
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,300
about that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hope we're trying</font>

53
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,290
to bridge<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gap between developers</font>

54
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,760
operations QA people farmers you employ

55
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,130
in your organization pretty much

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,670
everyone because doing security in silos

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,530
has worked really badly for us yeah

58
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,350
that's right cool you can all still hear

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,459
me I mean you're smiling so probably not

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,959
what do I mean by unicorns you've got

61
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,640
people at Google some of you may have

62
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,430
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them facebook they're all quite</font>

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,260
big companies Netflix it turns out not

64
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,290
every company can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion-dollar</font>

65
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:18,950
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a security team of hundreds</font>

66
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,650
of people it turns out that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

67
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,750
what my talk is like say you're not

68
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,370
Google how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do some security</font>

69
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,209
things and that's what i mean by non

70
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,790
unicorns because not everyone this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

71
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">unicorn despite my best wish and mr.</font>

72
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chow's looks best wish but the problem</font>

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,220
with security is hard like like really

74
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,809
hard obviously we have the hardest job

75
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,100
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're all</font>

76
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,160
here when we go to so many conferences

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,140
to really iterate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security is the</font>

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,630
hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing there is like finance it</font>

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,809
easy like software development easy blah

80
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:54,799
blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Security's like the hardest</font>

81
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,359
thing there's nothing harder I like

82
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's a bunch of examples there was the</font>

83
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,140
really cool

84
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,319
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago pinky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bone finding a bunch</font>

85
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">of really tiny bugs and chrome like able</font>

86
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,238
to overwrite a bit of graphics memory

87
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,489
tiny info leak here and chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all</font>

88
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,220
together get a full sandbox escape loads

89
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:14,170
of folks you just wouldn't expect would

90
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,089
actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything and it just breaks</font>

91
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,370
the entire security model of chrome

92
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,880
really cool Igor hammer hammer

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apology 05 small bugs in github</font>

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,260
that went from I can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one bug</font>

95
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,479
like this xss or this overriding<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjust</font>

96
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,219
to full control of a private repository

97
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,880
and now he has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company that basically</font>

98
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,229
breaks our through a living<font color="#E5E5E5"> the giggles</font>

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,400
security team were playing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chat</font>

100
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:41,469
application written in ojs yay and they

101
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,120
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> an XSS in it the within an hour</font>

102
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,610
they'd managed to turn into remote code

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,290
execution because no Jas running as an

104
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">application means you can run like</font>

105
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,620
system like that's a good idea and he

106
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,349
may have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a small company called</font>

107
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,450
target who had some credentials that are

108
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,620
on their HVAC system that may have cost

109
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,960
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and sixty million dollars</font>

110
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,430
MBD whatever so security is the hardest

111
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing there is nothing harder than</font>

112
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,240
security it's just that like building

113
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,430
things that aren't security<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
as well like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have no clue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

115
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,950
build github from the ground up some

116
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,810
days I struggle to push to github and if

117
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,669
it says merge conflict I'm like cool I

118
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,979
do something else anything I like do my

119
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:26,049
taxes call a relative whatever like I'm

120
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of trying to</font>

121
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,419
build chrome like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you even how</font>

122
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,190
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you make a GUI I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even like</font>

123
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">shell scripts don't prepare me for this</font>

124
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,310
kind of thing other stuff is hard so

125
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,889
that the security people in the room a

126
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,930
sense of perspective unlike our stuff

127
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,210
obviously the hardest like you have to

128
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,169
learn assembler you don't you have to

129
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,760
understand like memory allocation tables

130
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:55,000
processes all this other stuff yeah but

131
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,740
like building<font color="#CCCCCC"> software's hard being on</font>

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the finance team is hard being an HR is</font>

133
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,250
actually hard and having a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

134
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,280
perspective even humility which I know

135
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,110
is a bad word in our industry because it

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,039
doesn't get headlines or massive payouts

137
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,689
or all things like that but it turns out

138
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,549
like the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> people on particular</font>

139
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:18,879
good at writing software either like

140
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:20,589
snort has had 10 CBS this slides out of

141
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,659
date because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guarantee you why shark</font>

142
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:24,989
has had more<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS since</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i made the slide</font>

143
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:27,669
because turns out running protocol

144
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:32,109
pauses for every protocol ever made in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c</font>

145
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:33,849
is a terrible idea because as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick said</font>

146
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,549
writing C is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and everyone</font>

147
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:42,279
should do it well I get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk right</font>

148
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:46,508
right that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying original</font>

149
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:49,058
notes bit9 thanks for sponsoring they

150
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:52,809
got hacked a couple of years ago sorry

151
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:55,360
it's just true and then like bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

152
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,849
happen a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have been</font>

153
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending a bunch of time just destroying</font>

154
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:04,539
antivirus for fun probably not for

155
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:07,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">profit like Tavis from project zero ohms</font>

156
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,438
and people down in<font color="#CCCCCC"> South America which</font>

157
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,299
actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where they're</font>

158
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,009
saying it's more dangerous to run AV

159
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:15,969
because of the increased attack surface

160
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:18,219
than to not run AV because like viruses

161
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:23,589
really know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't copy that floppy</font>

162
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:25,119
in your fine Oh AV so easy to beat up on

163
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:30,610
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best one the one we will enjoy</font>

164
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:32,709
fire I caught running Apache PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> is root</font>

165
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,839
which is actually hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because by</font>

166
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,729
default on no operating system in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

167
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,449
world does it run as root you have to

168
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:43,479
actively go and change Apache to do that

169
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:48,459
so well done fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leading the way</font>

170
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:50,079
there so so who should you trust should

171
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,849
you trust no one as anyone who owns a

172
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,919
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> black t-shirts and goes to</font>

173
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:56,759
conferences will say obviously trusting

174
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,878
no one is the obvious correct assumption

175
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,110
my top side bro etc but that like isn't

176
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,639
good if you work in a company and want

177
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get paid and have friends and be</font>

178
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,379
invited to parties if you don't trust

179
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:10,269
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your company you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

180
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,849
terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and your company will</font>

181
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:14,769
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do very well so the other</font>

182
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,748
option is you trust everyone and if you

183
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:18,860
do I have some emails from Nigeria I

184
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:20,880
would love to forward you

185
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,020
nothing bad has ever happened from

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,940
trusting everyone just look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and</font>

187
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,620
should you trust security vendors

188
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,750
apologies if there's any security vendor

189
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:35,880
sitting in the second row p youth slide

190
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,799
fee if you have infinite money and no

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,059
attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I suggest trusting security</font>

192
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:46,170
vendors they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to help you with</font>

194
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:51,000
configurations may be available so i

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,590
recommend trusting attackers you kind of

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,910
know where you stand with those and if

197
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,740
you've used the internet and I'm led to

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,300
believe many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have then your</font>

202
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,520
happened with bug bounties you've

203
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:10,260
probably all heard of them if you

204
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,090
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's where you pay some random</font>

205
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,500
people around the world to break your

206
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,590
website and then tell you about it which

207

is it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible model there's two</font>

parts of your website that are not in

239
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:39,420
coffee at me we launched our bug bounty

240
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:40,709
program here in 2012 which is quite a

241
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,319
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm getting older</font>

242
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:45,719
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the first few weeks were</font>

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,370
pretty much the standard this is fine

244
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,459
everything's fine everything's on fire

245
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,160
and we've been building up to weep like

246
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,899
a 12-person security team a dead sea

247
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,829
witch regard we does include me so

248
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,449
arguably less than well less than 12 and

249
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,329
we had the first few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks were was all</font>

250
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:05,250
hands on deck going like there's another

251
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">XSS there's another thing and even</font>

252
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,680
though we thought we've done a pretty

253
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:15,000
decent job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I no way to signal science</font>

254
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,069
get all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security people from yeah</font>

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,440
and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd done a good job</font>

256
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:20,519
getting it there was still a lot of

257
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,319
reasonably low hanging fruit that we

258
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,759
somehow hadn't found and that's like the

259
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:25,410
good thing about bug bounty programs

260
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,079
they will find things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font>

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can never think of</font>

262

265
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,199
with bog mentor program is be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready with</font>

266
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,550
bees so one day someone on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

267
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,310
team who deals with most of the bug

268
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,109
bounties because we send t-shirts to

269
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,380
everyone who submits a valid bug bounty

270
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:53,190
were like we have their address you can

271
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">get frozen bees in a boss and because</font>

272
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,779
they're frozen they're asleep and if you

273
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,920
mail them to someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> they eventually</font>

mail

276
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:12,180
so when they open it expecting a t-shirt

277
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:15,600
lots of angry bees come out no our

278

lawyers would a lawyers would probably

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,360
very much like in distress we've never

280
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,310
done this and have no intention of doing

281
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,839
this you love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this and anyone</font>

282
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,839
who's run a bug bounty program will

283
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,520
agree they would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this but we</font>

284
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,610
aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that because we're at</font>

285
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,960
seeing we like hugging people bug bounty

286
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,160
programs as wonderful as they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

287
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,650
very much deal with your external

websites I haven't yet managed to find

289

paste bin so so so which makes it very

about github and the fun you can have

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,279
and if you're in a tacky you can have

over it and divide it by itself so

338
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:54,310
github is a great place where you can

339
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,070
store your<font color="#E5E5E5"> code many organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that this awful four by three projector</font>

343
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,399
like some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have put their RSA</font>

344
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,959
private keys and github which is

345
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,190
probably a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more trusting than you</font>

and also over here use my laser pointer

348
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,229
that's the github authentication token

349
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,760
which is just a token that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,500
same as a username and a password<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have full control over that repository</font>

353
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,339
so you're using github to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

now everyone can access you'll get up

this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a perfect model but like</font>

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,910
this would never happen in real life

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,819
no one would ever do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

374
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,350
case especially don't be dealing because

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,760
for your infrastructure like patching

434
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">bash is a terrible idea because you'll</font>

435
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,950
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have great bash when they write</font>

436
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,350
a 10 or 15 year old vulnerability in it

437
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,750
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to update it or like trying</font>

438
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it on the TTYL is also not a good</font>

439
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,070
idea this is in the kernel this it's

440
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,639
much harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

441
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,139
like have Colonel exploits gazhams on

442
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">etc but the trouble Authority days it's</font>

443
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,490
also the worst way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

444
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:29,740
into a log file for some reason the hall

445
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:34,210
are there any more red hat developers in

446
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,610
the room have we good is there a strict

449
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,960
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> like having multiple line output</font>

450
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:55,110

agree with him because it's seriously so

458
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:16,360
awful like why on earth would you have

459
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:18,520
multi-line logs in this day and age like

460
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,789
haven't we learnt this before from a

461

certain person

462
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:27,580
a company like anyone's ever had used

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tomcat and you're like why is the log</font>

464
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:35,080
randomly indented with spaces like what

465
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,609
how is a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to read that</font>

466
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,158
well it's like playful but humans can

467
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:43,879
read Python and humans can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> ja the</font>

471
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:58,399
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of coping with the</font>

horrors of oddity I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font>

473
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:03,949
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> throat slack because i know</font>

474
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:05,659
no longer talking to pee but that is if

475
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,309
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> money not infinite money but</font>

476
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:10,070
some money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use AWS and threats</font>

477
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,119
that's the best thing elk if you're

478
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,779
using elk which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like splunk but free</font>

479
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:20,149
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then that has a way of doing</font>

480
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,129
multi-line log filtering which is how

481
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,809
everyone is cope with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java if you're</font>

482
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,428
using a Splunk you don't need me to tell

you how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things you have a sea of</font>

00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,330
you can just go like go and do your

490
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,519
there are ways of coping it's just awful

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good thing once you have this</font>

493
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:52,849
data in like elastic search or<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk or</font>

00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:55,159
a collection of shoe boxes however you

495
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,019
decide to store this data is you can

496
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,239
then use like elastomer if you're using

497
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:02,029
oak and then you can learn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> net cap</font>

498
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:03,590
minus e bin sh which as anyone who owns

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of black t-shirts will tell you is</font>

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,059
a reverse shell with neca and that

501
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:09,349
should never really be run in your

502
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:11,539
infrastructure unless you employ

503
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:12,859
operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who like finding new</font>

504
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,779
and interesting ways to make your

505
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:18,349
alerting light up for doing things like

506
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,749
I definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> need my IRC alert appearing</font>

507
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:24,019
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my desktop I will definitely proxy</font>

508
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:25,849
those over an SSH tunnel and so car that

509
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,889
seems the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most obvious way of doing that</font>

510
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:29,658
you're like so you've definitely been

511
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,300
owned and you like no I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRC</font>

513
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:38,010
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my surprised face awesome and</font>

514
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,870
but with that you can also cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hate</font>

515
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,129
you p you can also do great things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

516
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:44,219
you can spot when people start doing

517
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:47,430
this kind of nonsense which is where you

518
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">download random things off the internet</font>

519
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,800
using curl or w<font color="#E5E5E5"> gert and then you pipe</font>

520
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:55,710
them straight into bash or more often

521
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:59,190
sudobash or pseudo<font color="#CCCCCC"> SH like that's a good</font>

522
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,900
idea if you trust this and clearly p

523
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,720
does you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should definitely run this on a</font>

524
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:07,350
map anyone has micro instead of legit

525
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,740
like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you people want from me</font>

526
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:13,110
that's better than gpg like genuinely

527
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:17,250
probably is better than gpg it's at

528
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,840
least more<font color="#E5E5E5"> user friendly than gpg and</font>

529
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,600
the argument put forward by people is

530
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,610
that they checked them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">give a few examples that are fun where</font>

532
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,929
that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter whether you</font>

533
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,580
check them or not because I'm stuck up

534
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,100
here presenting and you have to endure

535
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,590
it if you've heard of any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

536
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,110
malvert izing stuff recently they visit

537
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,780
stealing some of their cool tricks this

538
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,179
one's like if the HTTP user agent

539
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,129
contains curl and send back the payload

540
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,780
and if it's anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else print</font>

541
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that looks like install code</font>

542
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,250
so if you open it in chrome it looks

543
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,620
totally fine and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cool</font>

544
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,410
i'll trust that I'll pipe that into sh

545
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:00,149
and then Oh with our show boom you get

546
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:02,640
the get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up you in the game so</font>

547
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,970
that's one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can do that</font>

548
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">another way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that is used a lot in</font>

549
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">malva tising campaigns is like if I've</font>

550
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,940
ever talked to this IP address before

551
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,860
then print something that looks

552
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,570
legitimate if I haven't then send the

553
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,629
payload and this works in a number of

554
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,879
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the you will blindly trust it</font>

555
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,860
the thing get installed then you go huh

556
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,600
that's funny I wonder what that did and

557
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,370
then you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again go oh it looks</font>

558
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,469
fine I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what I'm doing</font>

559
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll type it again or if you go</font>

560
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,800
something weird happened on my machine

561
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,570
would you check this person sitting next

562
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me who naps out by the same IP</font>

563
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,800
address they look at again looks fine to

564
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,240
me I don't know what's gone wrong with

565
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:48,060
machine but so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too fun</font>

566
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,970
examples written in bad sinatra of how

567
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,550
you can own people with curl this is

568
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,560
what it looks like in terminal if any of

569
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:59,159
these terminal which is the default on

570
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,970
maps<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're all in austin and</font>

571
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,740
hipsters we're all running max and that

572
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,230
looks fine right you totally run that

573
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,620
that looks utterly fine this is what it

574
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,360
looks like an item and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using</font>

575
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,560
ASCII escape codes to change the color

576
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,360
of the text and that's why the there's a

577
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,760
space before that echo because it's

578
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,740
after the comment so the echo<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust is</font>

579
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,879
great never gets run in this payload but

580
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,760
it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets run in the</font>

581
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,710
previous one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you curl that to a</font>

582
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,900
file and then cat it you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the</font>

583
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,550
same thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the downloading it</font>

584
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,900
and then running it and then checking it

585
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,960
and then running it you're like but it's

586
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,400
fine it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it's fine and even if</font>

587
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,770
you don't can anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell me what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

588
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">does I it's not a foot balm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its Mac</font>

589
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific this is my mad zero-day payload</font>

590
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,050
yeah I've written rusticated shell

591
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,659
that's what I do for fun it runs p.m.

592
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:01,860
CET sleep which basically turned her to

593
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac to sleep you can tell that yeah</font>

594
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:08,669
whatever and this is no worse than

595
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,580
packages and this is the thing I hear

596
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,860
thrown around a lot and a part of the

597
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:18,000
packaging modal are broken like a lot of

598
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg signing is not perfect but there</font>

599
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,710
are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

600
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually verify them and even if you</font>

601
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,860
want verifying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg is amazing and</font>

602
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,360
you have a full chain of trust you are

603
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,889
at least verifying that what you have is

604
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,649
the things what someone else has and

605
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,790
there's some herd immunity in there

606
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,800
unless you're an anti backs are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

607
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,280
they did your kind of out of luck there

608
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,350
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg but also the good thing with</font>

609
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,420
packages is yes you can do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

610
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:50,230
put in malicious payloads and packages

611
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,759
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> MongoDB as it's cold but</font>

612
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:55,159
but like with this you have an artifact

613
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a thing on disk if you install</font>

614
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,700
something from a network it's ephemeral

615
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,469
at one time with this you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

616
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,389
incident response you can give this to

617
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,309
your GF aight RT and they would go oh

618
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:06,080
yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what happened this is what</font>

619
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,120
installed if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pull something off</font>

620
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,120
the internet one time that goes away and

621
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,998
the same of mr. chas logged point of if

622
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,309
you get cloned something is that better

623
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:18,440
or worse than curl<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would say it better</font>

624
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,120
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on disk and if you</font>

625
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,399
have it on disk you can actually inspect

626
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,969
it after the fact you could write a very

627
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:29,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool like thing that then modifies the</font>

628
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,789
stuff on disk but then you have to get

629
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,039
around get in that case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hashing</font>

630
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:36,139
of things so it gets complicated and you

631
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:38,629
can compare that again to upstream so

632
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:40,039
having not affect on disk is to me more

633
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:45,168
important than blindly trusting the

634
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:49,429
network and like these don't exist there

635
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:53,330
is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg verify option to sh at least</font>

636
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:56,240
I've discovered and that's kind of good

637
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:59,689
imagine mixing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sh with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg that would be</font>

638
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,119
a bad day and then there's the the other

639
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:07,340
thought which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think he'd covered again</font>

640
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:09,649
that like I trust HTTPS and but<font color="#CCCCCC"> syrtis</font>

641
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,959
like six dollars if<font color="#E5E5E5"> only your company as</font>

642
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:13,699
an attacker I can't make six dollars out

643
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,179
of it I should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> quit being an</font>

644
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,860
attacker and like to take up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ukulele</font>

645
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,769
i could probably get more than six

646
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,779
dollars from that and also if owning

647
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:26,179
your own company<font color="#E5E5E5"> or infrastructure is</font>

648
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:29,659
not worth six dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's anyone who's ever used linux</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">never work on linux or mac because</font>

homebrew changed it and then they moved

660
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:58,580
it out of curl and now it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

chain and co- kmix all this pain go away

664
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:17,129
but it doesn't so basically you're doing

665
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:19,590
that yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean get a quick a camera so</font>

666
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,530
there's there's a number of opinions on

667
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,659
what to do certainly some people have

668
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,899
had an entire blog post<font color="#E5E5E5"> going just stop</font>

669
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,540
caring we're mostly security people so

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,320
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure stop caring as a thing we</font>

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,879
do drink heavily might be a thing we do

android mechanical bulls no one has

673
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:48,240
explained this to me but because i'm a

675
00:29:48,240 --> 00:30:01,250
won't terminal alright that seems fine

676
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:01,250
right run that by that echoes test cool

677
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:12,689
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> curl is actually file don't don't</font>

678
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:15,480
pay behind the pen um should I run well

679
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,340
should I pipe that to sudo sure what are

680
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,310
we reckon those who know the arguments

681
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:27,899
of RM does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like a thing I want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that first first</font>

683
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:37,230
I'm gonna run this installer with curl

684
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:38,969
wipe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Sh yes yes I realized the</font>

685
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,130
irony in this I am Sideshow Bob

686
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:45,330
appearing on television saying stop

687
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:49,590
watching television but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I feel</font>

688
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:53,120
relatively confident in not finding my

689
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,120
command history there we go

690
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,850
doing it I'm doing it

691
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:10,570
so that's replaced curl with a shell

692
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,930
script that checks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

693
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:16,210
of curl is a pipe and if it is it runs

694
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,660
PS to see if there's pseudo<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH running</font>

695
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,790
on the same terminal and if it does it

696
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,280
just echoes out like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this</font>

697
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,080
please so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can still run that and it</font>

698
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,360
will still go like that will work but if

699
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do sudo SH it's like nope stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

700
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and you can use this to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

702
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,510
pipe to sudo SH and I suggest you go do

703
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere and then never have to</font>

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:46,300
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again I tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a package</font>

705
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:51,010
but it was too hard so didn't bother my

706
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:58,090
demo worked all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right oh yeah that's</font>

707
00:31:51,010 --> 00:32:00,340
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> great contrast uh so 2015</font>

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,920
like stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc has never been done</font>

718
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">before like this oh wait no churu exists</font>

719
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:32,020
is that hasn't that existed a while like

720
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:34,600
does anyone remember using chroot so why

721
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,400
did we stop using<font color="#CCCCCC"> churu it's because</font>

722
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,840
remembering the flags to compiled bind

723
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,580
with statically just was too damn hard

724
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,350
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

725
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:48,280
it's understandable the doctor now has

726
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:49,449
taken that and done<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the magic it has</font>

727
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,129
and is blowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world away because</font>

728
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,720
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else exists wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no previously</font>

729
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,420
jailers have existed for like ten plus

730
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,750
years and they're like way more capable

731
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:00,610
so why didn't they work I'm like my fear

732
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,380
with that is because previously is only

733
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,189
used by like me some people in Germany

734
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,130
and yeah

735
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,660
who wants and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there which</font>

736
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,200
apparently isn't enough to get VC

737
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">funding in San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

738
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so previously jails didn't</font>

739
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,590
work because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that advertising</font>

740
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,320
whatever but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight to Dhaka wait</font>

741
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:24,250
no solara zones<font color="#CCCCCC"> have existed I like what</font>

742
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,720
20 years maybe and I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't</font>

743
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked because trying to get a developer</font>

744
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:32,860
excited about Solaris yeah a little

745
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:36,100
challenging let's say trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

746
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:38,199
anyone excited about Solaris is other

747
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:45,040
than an attacker I imagine an attacker

748
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:46,750
is like Solaris I'll be home soon gonna

749
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,780
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the week off this one</font>

750
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:55,510
should be a doddle why is<font color="#CCCCCC"> tish loaded um</font>

751
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:57,010
but alright so let's ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> Solaris this</font>

752
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,570
is obviously never been done<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no</font>

753
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">one's ever used to lara's so what but</font>

754
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:05,950
like AIX even has this but no one knows

755
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,090
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use W pars because it's on AIX</font>

756
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:11,110
and you can even install ssh or make

757
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,630
which would probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean your</font>

758
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:15,910
developers won't pick it up very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

759
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,230
explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to your developer that it</font>

760
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,839
doesn't have bash what do you mean it

761
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,240
doesn't bash I'll just compile it

762
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,790
there's no compilers what do you mean

763
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:28,509
there's no compilers you're new here<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

764
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:32,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm so docker blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

765
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:33,970
whatever but the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

766
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,840
keep throwing around and suddenly thrown

767
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:39,759
around in that talk is is docker secure

768
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,730
and a while ago there was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

769
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,580
thing that came out please Fitz Fitz I'm

770
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,290
weirdly formatted but it fits the thirty

771
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,909
percent of images in docker hub contain

772
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,550
high priority security vulnerabilities

773
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:54,310
that sounds like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if anyone</font>

774
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">works in an organization that has a</font>

775
00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:00,190
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of infrastructure that number</font>

776
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:03,370
doesn't sound impossible right like if

777
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone has nt4 might be a killer</font>

778
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:10,420
overkill but like a Windows Server 2000

779
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:13,349
and yes

780
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,599
like if you have a red<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart like five</font>

781
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:18,970
maybe six<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably that numbers mean</font>

782
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:25,450
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an isn't that out there like</font>

783
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:27,578
this is also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same headline yeah</font>

784
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,339
turns out things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are static and</font>

785
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:33,549
baked one point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time get security</font>

786
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:35,380
vulnerabilities in them that's not I

787
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:37,900
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how that's quite the shocking</font>

788
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,150
news of his owner Bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> bass but the</font>

789
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,460
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is like this is really where</font>

790
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,400
everyone gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a windows media from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

791
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:50,760
not msdn is it and like if you can trust

792
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:54,910
the very clean no virus or trojan<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font>

793
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,569
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Kyle Bosch is bad like</font>

794
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,009
that's better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg that one is it's</font>

795
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:01,660
totally legit yeah it's better than my

796
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:04,630
domain it's like the most trustworthy

797
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,490
thing ever I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to bet that there</font>

798
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,849
is a slim chance that over thirty

799
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:12,029
percent of Windows torrents may contain

800
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:14,410
high priority security vulnerabilities

801
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,250
such as you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Isis from</font>

802
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:21,190
torrents um if anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez vagrant like</font>

803
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:23,619
this is how you does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fit if it's</font>

804
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,119
enough this is how you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> side rich</font>

805
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:29,890
vagrant image to use a shortened URL

806
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,890
like what am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to infer about how</font>

807
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,150
trustworthy that is like if people will

808
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,368
if there aren't people who have a

809
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,160
weekend project of Trojan inveigh grant

810
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:41,319
images to own developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large oil</font>

811
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,529
organizations do I have a project for

812
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,509
you that's like that just seems easy

813
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,270
like here trust this random URL that

814
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:50,079
goes to an s3 bucket which you have no

815
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,000
ability to work out whether it's

816
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,130
trustworthy or not and people will trust

817
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,829
it especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you tell them it</font>

818
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:58,210
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> two other things you want</font>

819
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:01,119
exploiting humans blah blah blah but

820
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this just seems like a bad idea worse</font>

821
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,670
than trusting curve so is dr. itself

822
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,010
secure because that's kind of the thing

823
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,470
people care about and if you've ever

824
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,829
heard of a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> called fire I this</font>

825
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:17,200
slide might be appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you</font>

826
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't run things as root in Dhaka then</font>

827
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,629
the story kinda gets better and there's

828
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,970
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other things you can do like</font>

829
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">is privileged mode which its kind of</font>

830
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,189
clue phul in the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can drop</font>

831
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:30,930
capabilities so it can mount file

832
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,210
systems account do some types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of network</font>

833
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,910
calls you can use docker notary which is

834
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,309
a fancy way of making curl pipe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> SH</font>

835
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,690
not as sketchy and it's backed by some

836
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:44,789
actually solid solidly research crypto

837
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,980
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> often say you should use things</font>

838
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:49,470
like gr security selinux<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you</font>

839
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,839
should but no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is let's be honest</font>

840
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,519
like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> attackers have gone oh</font>

841
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,009
this is running gr security I better

842
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,618
like really dig down no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one no one's</font>

843
00:37:56,009 --> 00:38:04,049
doing them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and selinux is the tool for</font>

844
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:05,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">making you disable selinux upon boo but</font>

845
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:08,869
like going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the original question</font>

846
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:12,809
is darker secure more secure than what

847
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:16,470
and to an extent from<font color="#CCCCCC"> whom which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

848
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:18,029
basic threat modeling which no one

849
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,578
appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing anymore which is</font>

850
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like it must be secure and you</font>

851
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,710
like you haven't given me any parameters

852
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:32,250
if my attacker has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a billion dollars of</font>

853
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:34,019
budget we lose basic facts so this yeah

854
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,690
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said that brilliant spider</font>

855
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:38,220
bouncing been<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that</font>

856
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,099
lateral movement is kind of more

857
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:45,089
important than you ID equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and it</font>

858
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:47,519
seems that there's a degree degree of

859
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,839
focus on getting root on things and I

860
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,169
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes out of how cool we were</font>

861
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,430
in the 90s but as an attacker if I can

862
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,400
get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit card information with</font>

863
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,660
you ID equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight I didn't care I've</font>

864
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,150
got your credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card information and</font>

865
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,160
like given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of getting root on</font>

866
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,900
a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in a useless place on</font>

867
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network or having just lateral</font>

868
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,220
access from a very central place in your

869
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:12,930
network I will go for non route every

870
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,868
time and be able to get two more things

871
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:19,169
with because like privilege doesn't

872
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:21,299
matter so much in the very thousands of

873
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:24,180
machine distributed machines model that

874
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:26,130
we've moved into when there was just one

875
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,240
machine and that contained like mail web

876
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:32,000
database your ancient copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailman</font>

877
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,859
sending your passwords every month

878
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,810
then like getting root on that box was

879
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,110
actually useful but now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 400</font>

880
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:40,790
web servers 200 database servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> root an</font>

881
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,910
individual machine is no longer quite

882
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,490
the prize it was and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the docker</font>

883
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:49,819
this makes a ton of sense because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

884
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:52,100
have credentials on a docker thing

885
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,230
container I would far rather have that

886
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,270
than have root on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server that has</font>

887
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing and the fact whether it's</font>

890
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,920
hardware to an attacker I don't care

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it's running on I just care what I</font>

892
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,180
can do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it more access i can get</font>

893
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it so I'm not saying darker is</font>

894
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,529
unhackable because it's not it's just

895
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">some see groups into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> namespacing which</font>

896
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:17,690
is really cool stuff but it's not as

897
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,609
hardened as a hypervisor it's just a you

898
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,480
shouldn't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this rather than a set</font>

899
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:26,300
of an abstraction out escapes will

900
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,250
probably happen they'll probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

901
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,310
names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> logos and we'll all probably</font>

902
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,780
drunk a lot about it I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

903
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,520
matters as much unless you have to

904
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,860
manage it but they have at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

905
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,880
useful security team who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are open to</font>

906
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,610
doing things about it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it can</font>

907
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way that's secure enough</font>

908
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,480
but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you should just</font>

909
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,860
install it everywhere just because it's

910
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,470
new and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shiny and you think it's cool</font>

911
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,740
and like stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> network separation</font>

912
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,359
is still as important as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever was and</font>

913
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,950
I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are mostly</font>

914
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,300
using some very flat networks and cloud

915
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:04,250
networks rather than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block</font>

916
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,990
lockdown access to certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

917
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,060
this is stuff called unit kernels which

918
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,950
compiles your application into a kernel

919
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,759
and then there's no user land<font color="#CCCCCC"> and its</font>

920
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:15,330
own magical<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco stuff who</font>

921
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,450
cares

922
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:24,299
a good thing you can use with docker is

923
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:26,339
everyone's favorite thing if you if you

924
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,920
not heard of Jenkins it's a build

925
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:32,760
pipeline tool basically if you have

926
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:35,490
developers she probably do they put

927
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,860
their code in it runs tests both the

928
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,229
test the developers have written and

929
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,820
then it spits out at the end going it

930
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't it didn't work go and deploy a</font>

931
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah the great thing about</font>

932
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:49,770
Jenkins is its entire job is to take

933
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,990
random code seemingly arbitrary code and

934
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,600
run it with access to you like secrets

935
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:59,220
and credentials and keys and things like

936
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this like this is Jenkins is job it's</font>

937
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,680
just remote code as a service which

938
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,230
seems a little bold I know number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

939
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,750
people on the offensive side who like

940
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:13,080
they've got Jenkins we've won there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

941
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,840
third and because it's all x-mas

942
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,400
xml-based<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex it's very easy for it</font>

943
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,470
to get very<font color="#E5E5E5"> crafty and it's still</font>

944
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,770
contained to your codes and secrets but

945
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,419
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all they've hopefully made it</font>

946
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,960
so you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like i can just</font>

947
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:32,220
randomly put code<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to execute via the</font>

948
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,830
web that will run every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time this seems</font>

949
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,959
a bold thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's worth there's</font>

950
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:38,940
this whole script console well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

951
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if you can see that that's like the</font>

952
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,010
UID of Jenkins it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running ID and just</font>

953
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,430
outputting it that it's like a shell in

954
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:53,880
a web page who thought this was a good

955
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:55,830
idea clearly someone but the if you do

956
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,020
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenkins in your infrastructure then</font>

957
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,960
disabling execution on the master which

958
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,210
is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built i can make a</font>

959
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,330
job on it give me a shell on it which

960
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,160
just seems a terrible idea it has a not

961
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,810
the best authentication model but it's

962
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,500
better than anonymous access which is

963
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:14,970
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a web shell and if you can use</font>

964
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Travis and make it somebody else's</font>

965
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,480
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really nice idea just</font>

966
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,180
pay someone some money and it becomes

967
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,050
their problem but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Jenkins could</font>

968
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,960
be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I Nick talked</font>

969
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:32,220
about this earlier in his life not

970
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and today 2012 maybe even maybe even in</font>

971
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Austin you talked about this in Austin</font>

972
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:41,569
yeah local hero and this is a using a

973
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of unit tests in your code to make</font>

974
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,650
actual security decisions about your

975
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:49,650
code as they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being pushed through the</font>

976
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:52,710
gauntlet project done by Matt yay and

977
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:55,020
wicked about being mean to your code is

978
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">using Jenkins to actually test how good</font>

979
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:01,080
your coders there's a whole secure

980
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:03,089
pipeline get our project and even Adobe

981
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,279
have a blog and doing secure pipeline

982
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:08,430
stuff the only part in Adobe where

983
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,560
security is mentioned is a blog post on

984
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,490
doing this you're like can you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

985
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,150
and talk to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

986
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:18,660
organization please I like what that

987
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:21,810
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but the idea is you can</font>

988
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:28,020
turn your Jenkins from being this which

989
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:30,299
works better on 16 by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 to this I just</font>
