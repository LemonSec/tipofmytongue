1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,780
our speed debates rules are very simple

2
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,779
we've got two teams each team is going

3
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to four people I get to decide whose</font>

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,390
affirmative and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose negative which</font>

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,040
means some people are going to be

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,540
talking about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't</font>

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily want to talk about and</font>

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's okay the affirmative is going to</font>

9
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,220
get to speak first then our negative our

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,080
affirming gets to rebut or negative gets

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,390
to rebut and then you all get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote on</font>

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">who wins and at the end of the speed</font>

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,810
debates we tally it all up and we decide

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:54,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">who wins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay simple thumbs up everybody</font>

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,519
debate position number one developers

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,140
will still need to be concerned about

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,510
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,089
five years our affirmative team over

62
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,299
here our negative team over here where's

63
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:16,310
my timekeeper right here my time you

64
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,560
fever mr. David Hughes I suggest that

65
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,238
they hold the glass of water and sit in

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,130
front whoever speaking at the moment and

67
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">when times up splashing on the face but</font>

68
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,330
it got vetoed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately David's</font>

69
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gonna make a loud noise one time</font>

70
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,520
just use beer instead so two minutes on

71
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:36,770
the clock affirmative who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speak</font>

72
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,030
first we're right all right two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

73
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,960
and then you can pass the mic however

74
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,109
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want cross-site scripting you know</font>

75
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those things we've had it in</font>

76
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,860
our life pretty long time I mean you

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,540
look back five years ago what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ross top ten anybody across the script</font>

79
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:08,650
let's go back ten years what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:12,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's yeah 3 yeah 31 ok back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to three uh</font>

81
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,349
just guessing I mean Jack Jack did sort

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,570
of prepare us earlier and said that like

83
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,790
problems that we had in the 60s like

84
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,099
we're still having today I'm guessing

85
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:26,300
you know another five years isn't going

86
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,950
to stop cross-site scripting let's look

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,500
at all these other problems you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had that</font>

88
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:36,030
we fix such as sharing credentials no

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,770
buffer overflows know

90
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,299
like everything else in security that we

91
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,650
haven't solved I'm really confident

92
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,630
cross-site scripting will be the one we

93
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,710
get right because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have multiple</font>

94
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,000
websites they're not getting more

95
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,080
complicated a<font color="#E5E5E5"> war that stopped existing</font>

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,590
web frameworks are getting more

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,789
opinionated but not necessarily better

98
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,099
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting more names at least</font>

99
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm finding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bay Area and jQuery</font>

100
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,060
is newer and angular etc so I'm

101
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,970
confident that'll be fixed that'll be

102
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one we fixed with uh yeah definitely</font>

103
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:11,110
that one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's obvious that</font>

104
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,219
developers are still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to be</font>

105
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,640
worried about cross-site scripting in

106
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,960
five years because if we fixed any

107
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,640
problems then we couldn't have cool

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:27,039
conferences like this so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

109
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:31,409
really unthinkable yeah it's it's it's

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,880
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 technics can tag</font>

111
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:44,670
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll still be fighting this in five</font>

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:47,290
years boom drop the mic all right

113
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:54,430
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 minutes on the clock who's</font>

114
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:57,220
starting no actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's safe</font>

115
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say that developers won't need to be</font>

116
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerned about cross-site scripting in</font>

117
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,400
five years because we will find even

118
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,400
dumber shit for them to ignore

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,920
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're gonna have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the robot uprising</font>

121
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,820
there's not gonna be any humans to do

122
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,740
stupid shit I think it's not going to be

123
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,930
a concern anymore because James that

124
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,850
signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> sciences is going to invent some</font>

125
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,090
great technology to prevent any<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploits</font>

126
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,650
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan is going to use thread fix</font>

127
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,539
to make sure we can all track it and get

128
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:43,310
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them early sdlc let's explore the</font>

129
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,919
word care<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a minute do developers</font>

130
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care about cross-site scripting</font>

131
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,770
or they just deal with it actually I

132
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,210
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they will care in five years</font>

133
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,370
because most of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

134
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,979
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the CI pipeline so they won't</font>

135
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,540
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> care and what we'll be doing is</font>

136
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,669
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that one engineer who</font>

137
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,770
wants to break things and they'll be the

138
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,180
one that cares will they<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a developer</font>

139
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:11,539
probably not they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be a</font>

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:21,560
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer I did say that out</font>

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:26,030
loud<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright drop the mic audience what</font>

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,680
do we do oh yeah yeah would you like I'm

143
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,419
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broad I don't really notice we</font>

144
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,940
need a rebuttal James he dropped the mic

145
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:38,270
the game is oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah you know bankim</font>

146
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,780
you have quite impeccable logic can't

147
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,819
really argue with that part so you know

148
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,680
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will persist to say that it</font>

149
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,750
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a problem yeah i</font>

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,160
think the robot uprising will be halted

151
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,160
by across the scripting attack

152
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,030
we'll be thinking cross-site scripting

153
00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:00,400
for existing when those robots come to

154
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:02,500
eat our heads this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

155
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">question cross-site scripting is a give</font>

away your life span of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simulants of</font>

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,390
future will be saved the cross-site

159
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,520
scripting you'll be thanking us not just

160
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">for conferences but for the robots not</font>

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,939
killing every one of us all right times

162
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,709
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative you get one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more shot I</font>

163
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,210
believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team on the other side</font>

164
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,100
of the stage has completely missed the

165
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,920
point the question was will they care

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,710
not will there be<font color="#CCCCCC"> D cross-site scripting</font>

167
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,290
because their<font color="#CCCCCC"> arguments are weak we'll</font>

168
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,570
have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change the question the</font>

169
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,339
question is will developers care the

170
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:45,940
answer is no what why would they start

171
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:52,480
five years from now because of the local

172
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:55,150
uprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right case closed audience</font>

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,670
you get to vote if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that the</font>

174
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:07,160
affirmative team had the best debate

175
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:10,399
give it up it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long hour</font>

176
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:16,310
okay if you got things has a negative

177
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:18,139
team did better give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right we</font>

178
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:23,560
have a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the negative team</font>

179
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,560
excellent job guys excellent job<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

180
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:34,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so next topic continuous</font>

181
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:37,610
deployment is the best model for the

182
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,459
security of web applications this time

183
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,560
we have you guys on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the negative and you</font>

184
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:47,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys on the affirmative you guys have</font>

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,160
two minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's gonna start so</font>

186
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,029
continuous deployment gives us the

187
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,009
opportunity to to address web

188
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,750
application security early in the

189
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,939
software development lifecycle and as

190
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly and rapidly as possible</font>

191
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:01,969
throughout the stage of building our

192
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,490
software so from this and the day we

193
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,410
start the idea the day we deploy code we

194
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,670
can bake<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security and security tests</font>

195
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,199
and automation throughout the second the

196
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,790
web application space is all about

197
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,000
fighting forward continuous delivery

198
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,529
allows as a graphic identification of

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,019
problems and fighting forward to

200
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">solvable continuous delivery will become</font>

201
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,279
a great security model for the future

202
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,209
so as the resident optimist the thing

203
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,579
that I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the continuous</font>

204
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:38,050
deployment model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that once you start</font>

205
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,930
down that path one of the things you

206
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to fix is your regression and back</font>

207
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,880
up to your friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the faster you can</font>

208
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,040
recover from screwing up the more secure

209
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,960
you can be and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with a negative</font>

210
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">spin I think it's absolutely true that</font>

211
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,029
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to that model gives us the</font>

212
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,830
tools to recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly and push</font>

213
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">matches quickly and then when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

214
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,089
sends us crappy patches we can unwind

215
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,010
when you know a bunt or whoever sends us

216
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:05,230
crappy patches we can unwind when the

217
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,520
colonel plugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we can unwind it move</font>

218
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,110
forward we can that we can balance

219
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:18,610
security and productivity have 30

220
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:23,050
seconds what they say all right you guys

221
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,750
up okay go all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right negative as a</font>

222
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:31,209
former model I am the best model for the

223
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">security industry I'm Way better than</font>

224
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:40,770
continues anything Wow all this DevOps

225
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,770
nonsense is a fad

226
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,720
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys you know for if</font>

227
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,949
we're looking back at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a couple</font>

228
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">years I think we're gonna see the common</font>

229
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,670
criteria for websites make a big

230
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,220
resurgence and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see how</font>

231
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,809
you're gonna have time to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

232
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,160
orange book stuff if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying all</font>

233
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:03,410
this continuous just one just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna</font>

234
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:07,249
work yeah the continuous deployment is

235
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:10,669
useful but if it just allows you to

236
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:16,069
continually deliver bad code quickly I

237
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:17,329
don't see how it solves the problem you

238
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,009
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the main</font>

239
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,888
problems so we're we haven't thought

240
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:24,559
about here is it who's really doing

241
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:27,379
continuous deployment how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

242
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,719
here would say they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah</font>

243
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:32,449
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem what that security</font>

244
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,129
doesn't just hit the three unicorns the

245
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:37,849
the one percent of the one percent it

246
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:40,519
hits everybody so my thought is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

247
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:48,829
can't be the solution because no one's

248
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:51,139
using it yeah 30 seconds yeah we're

249
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,729
dropping the mic all right but we're

250
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:55,129
respectful of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone so we're</font>

251
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,439
just gonna hold it safely affirmative

252
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,439
team you get one<font color="#CCCCCC"> man for rebuttal</font>

253
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:09,919
they're waving the white flag not yet a

254
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:12,259
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> art I think continuous deployment</font>

255
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
is going to take off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> while James</font>

256
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,339
believes it not enough people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using</font>

257
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,879
it I truly believe the rugged movement

258
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:22,819
is going to to capitalize on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

259
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a you know buy-in from lots of</font>

260
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:29,988
different companies that are not using

261
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:31,639
contingent<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon it today while nobody</font>

262
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:33,709
today is currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> using continuous</font>

263
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,199
deployment except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for three unicorns on</font>

264
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:38,089
the room nobody is really secure either

265
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,569
so I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> James's argument is quite</font>

266
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,569
specious

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,320
and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an gauntlet fan and user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very</font>

268
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,060
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that that those</font>

269

technologies are going to help us<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

270
00:14:52,060 --> 00:15:00,400
continuous deployment all right negative

271
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:02,890
team so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is clear and we can kind of</font>

272
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:07,029
jump off<font color="#CCCCCC"> James starting point on who's</font>

273
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:14,589
using it it is clear pci is the best

do secure pipeline CIF um we're very

289
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,250
thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the affirmative team won</font>

290
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:18,660
the debate give it up if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought</font>

291
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the negative team won</font>

292
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:30,010
only negativity was big in the industry

293
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:34,240
all right all right good job guys good

294
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:42,460
job let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep this moving position</font>

295
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:45,820
number three docker is more secure this

296
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the old based on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slides you guys</font>

297
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,600
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> move on this one just two</font>

298
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes I just did 45 minutes on this</font>

299
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,830
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want about you can i miss my</font>

300
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,980
talk this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is on you you're mean</font>

301
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:00,400
doctor doctor doctor like the slides are

302
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:02,110
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm more secure more like</font>

303
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,490
if you run shitty code on bare metal

304
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,310
versus your own shitty code in the

305
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,150
container guess what's still shitty it's

306
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">your good like just because it's run by</font>

307
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:19,330
a Bay Area<font color="#E5E5E5"> startup doesn't make your</font>

308
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:23,649
code better like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh wait yeah so like it</font>

309
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:27,369
as secure as are the shitty things<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

310
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,200
linux mint linux is secure and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

311
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,580
run it with gr security which is more

312
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,810
secure than anything else you're running

313
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,820
so you can I trust them hmm you can

314
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:41,290
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware you have more money than</font>

315
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,030
security you're gonna trust AWS which is

316
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,370
basically outsourcing your security just

317
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,389
some random people in Seattle which

318
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,969
doesn't make you moan so here it just

319
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:54,310
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sound rainy problem i'll remind</font>

320
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:59,530
you that you are the affirmative I don't

321
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:01,240
give me a drink yeah oh yeah who drinks

322
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,360
drinks time containers which

323
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,049
surprisingly whole thing is very nicely

324
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,248
they keep though

325
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:11,168
separated<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the other things now now</font>

326
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:13,179
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure than like</font>

327
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,830
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is kind of in the same</font>

328
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:19,330
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ambiguous but you know it's</font>

329
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know though the I might have</font>

330
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought that one I gonna get yeah okay</font>

331
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">but think about this docker requires you</font>

332
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,049
to take a disciplined approach to how

333
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,700
you're building your infrastructure that

334
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:35,799
could be more secure than kind of like

335
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,779
slapping stuff on stuff on our wiki or

336
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,509
running some crazy bash scripts and

337
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:42,190
logging into stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh yeah cool</font>

338
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:43,809
thing about doctors you probably don't

339
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,690
have ssh on it you probably don't have a

340
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:50,499
bunch of other stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have read</font>

341
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:53,139
your system all right that like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

342
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:58,929
or does time or official time that's why

343
00:18:53,139 --> 00:19:03,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">i thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a good point good for</font>

344
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:05,919
a second as a prop no damn it up so as

345
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:08,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">james said a darker things come in</font>

346
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,460
containers and like drinks but teenage

347
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:15,189
have holes right and and so because

348
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,350
detainers have holes and openings<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

349
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:22,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that's a challenge that that's why</font>

350
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:25,509
they're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> not more secure daughter</font>

351
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:31,539
was written by developers for developers

352
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:35,919
so this isn't ad hominem must be not so

353
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:39,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have three words for you docker run</font>

354
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,899
dash dash privileged

355
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,600
doesn't this we headed this argument

356
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,549
with virtualization at this argument

357
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,330
with cloud writing it with container is

358
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:58,120
a shin each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies has</font>

359
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:02,470
allowed us to make the same mistakes

360
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:09,158
plus new ones in record time at record

361
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:11,620
steal the difference between docker and

362
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,179
not docker is I can either hand you an

363
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:20,830
atom bomb or I can give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you in a</font>

364
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:22,419
container and i would say please put

365
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:27,309
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into container then just don't just</font>

366
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:36,010
give me that put it in something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

367
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:38,879
wrap it nicely for you let<font color="#E5E5E5"> that drop the</font>

368
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:42,720
mic is that it you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a container</font>

369
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">+ + y pense</font>

370
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:55,810
all right affirm your fee<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Boyd</font>

371
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:00,230
please don't do that let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack yes</font>

372
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and let's see yeah I do want stuff</font>

373
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,420
in containers not atom bombs just

374
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting out there so most over is</font>

375
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:23,090
written by developers that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

376
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">works so you could run it with minus</font>

377
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,860
minus privileged so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like</font>

378
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,100
don't run everything that's rude that

379
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,469
works on bare metal like don't run stuff

380
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,050
badly is your open worldwide<font color="#CCCCCC"> docket it's</font>

381
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,850
not secure like you can give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it bad</font>

382
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:56,240
options and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad things yeah</font>

383
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:58,610
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a hammer we're done so it's</font>

384
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,020
good man they're desperate yeah they're

385
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:06,469
feeling the pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so i</font>

386
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:10,550
won't go dr. run dash dash privileged<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

387
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:19,520
will instead say dr. run dash entry

388
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:23,419
point so I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just deleted the host root</font>

389
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,070
filesystem and yes I can do that but on

390
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,440
running second secure that I can give

391
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:31,129
users different privileges anybody who

392
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,750
runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> docker run can do that any body you</font>

393
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,880
can run a docker container you can

394
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">delete the root file system or any other</font>

395
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,480
final thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a good idea and as</font>

396
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,100
far as developers and software everyone

397
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,280
in this room has run into this person

398
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not a developer I just do web stuff</font>

399
00:22:49,580 --> 00:23:06,439
all right good job good job yeah yeah

400
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so before before we vote on</font>

401
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:24,240
who won everybody take<font color="#CCCCCC"> drink yeah should</font>

402
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,790
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do each other it wasn't part of the</font>

403
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,100
rules but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so audience</font>

404
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,629
vote I info if you guys thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

405
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,399
affirmative team on the debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it</font>

406
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,630
up all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right pretty good pretty good if</font>

407
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,190
you guys thought the negative team won

408
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,960
the debate give it up all right i think

409
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the affirmative team won that one we</font>

410
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:58,110
give it all right all right 22 12 to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

411
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,199
position number for web application

412
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:06,060
firewalls are effective application

413
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,280
security schools we have our affirmative

414
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,050
team web application firewalls are

415
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,230
effective security tools who would like

416
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:21,030
to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one Chris you it seems</font>

417
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:23,370
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I Benedict</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maco showed</font>

418
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,320
last year that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys again soon they</font>

419
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,899
are tools right and to all tools can be

420
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,960
used as tools or weapons having been any

421
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,150
traditional firewall business not that

422
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,630
many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like to make fun</font>

423
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:39,960
of them and I say as with traditional

424
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,970
firewalls with web application firewalls

425
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,080
you can make fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you</font>

426
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,080
deploy one properly

427
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:05,340
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LS flippant answer is that it is</font>

428
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
a valuable tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> used properly if you</font>

429
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,080
think throwing a laugh in front of your

430
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">website makes you safe it makes you slow</font>

431
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,928
and insecure if you create specific

432
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,149
rules for specific problems to buy

433
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,940
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to do what needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

434
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:23,219
done or to mitigate a problem they work

435
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,289
fantastically our problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

436
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,450
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people use them they come</font>

437
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:30,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some box that also does packet</font>

438
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,830
filtering or<font color="#E5E5E5"> next-gen and firewall and</font>

439
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:35,039
they click the box and they say I'm safe

440
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:37,620
and so they use it wrong so if you use

441
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,879
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> right people like the intelligent</font>

442
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:44,428
audience we have here understands the

443
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:49,830
specific point solutions that laughs can

444
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:53,190
provide yeah yeah so I think that

445
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,980
application firewalls forget about web

446
00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:00,240
application firewalls lost the they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

447
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,620
the whatever back in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s write</font>

448
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,419
a check can we beat the hell out of

449
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,789
raptors and all that stuff however

450
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,789
they're coming back and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna win</font>

451
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:15,600
this time that's my argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just</font>

452
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:19,620
the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right negative team</font>

453
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,279
your rebuttal please I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack really</font>

454
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:26,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">did most of our work for us said all you</font>

455
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,610
gotta do is thoughtfully deploy it

456
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,809
correctly configured right retain it is

457
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,809
anybody ever seen one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

458
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,900
therefore not effective

459
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,699
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could configure it correctly in</font>

460
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first place would you need it in the</font>

461
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,970
first place because you could probably

462
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:56,730
just write a decent weather like like it

463
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,230
it's a I'm not good enough to web so can

464
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,390
I put this thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of my web so</font>

465
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,020
it's safer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I have to configure</font>

466
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:17,820
it to be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of web doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

467
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:22,440
the strongest argument but it's it's a

468
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:28,350
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mic drop is what it is yeah this is a</font>

469
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:32,010
pretty pretty simple it as Dan said the

470
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">laugh is so difficult to get right and</font>

471
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">it only works against traditional web</font>

472
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,590
apps as we're moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

473
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,330
more restful interfaces they start to

474
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,590
fall apart then I'll deal with JSON<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

475
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,470
don't deal with what you're dealing with

476
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,629
so if they can't keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

477
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:52,650
development models they're ineffective

478
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:54,480
out of boss all right let me just look

479
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,159
just look where where did the web app

480
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,309
firewalls come from they came from

481
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,990
network vendors primarily you know and

482
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:03,299
they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of coming from</font>

483
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,330
the wrong angle to solve a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem kind</font>

484
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the wrong way you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a vendors and</font>

485
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,879
I have a better solution I will not

486
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">promote on this because there's still</font>

487
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:20,250
more questions coming in so all right a

488
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">probe team your revolt please so we know</font>

489
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:24,440
that we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good at taking</font>

490
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,659
vulnerabilities out of web applications

491
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,400
so at least WAAFs will buy us a little

492
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of time on that side of things and</font>

493
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing else in it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

494
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,809
outside in right so protecting

495
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,610
applications themselves but they're also

496
00:28:33,809 --> 00:28:39,299
good from the inside out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

497
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,949
against users so they have their place

498
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,690
they're not the panacea that everybody

499
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,190
that does the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question seems to imply</font>

500
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,400
they are but they do have some

501
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,679
effectiveness there's another value to

502
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,169
firewalls has even talked about web app

503
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,659
and others which is that they're a great

504
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,250
inspection point for traffic and since

505
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:58,050
people are going to write crappy code

506
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,710
it lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> us know what went wrong because</font>

507
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:05,820
web developers don't log for shit and so

508
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:11,090
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to afterthought our detection to</font>

509
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,090
amplify that been said decent web app

510
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:25,860
all right negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rebuttal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

511
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:31,670
whoo-hoo in the audience has a web app

512
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:33,570
firewall deployed right now okay yeah

513
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,140
you have a lot of friends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

514
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,389
organization yeah how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> have them</font>

515
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:46,560
like an actual defensive like blocking

516
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:48,210
you type mode okay 1122<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so I</font>

517
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,490
mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how you judge</font>

518
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,490
effectiveness but I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas</font>

519
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:07,530
whoever said yeah they do buy you some

520
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:10,229
time I believe how to put latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

521
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">right this game works so if if you</font>

522
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:17,250
thought that the affirmative team won

523
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:19,620
the debate give it up that's that sound

524
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a PE class if you thought</font>

525
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,360
that the negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> team won the debate</font>

526
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,360
give it up

527
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:37,299
galavis all right current score<font color="#CCCCCC"> 31</font>

528
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:47,510
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ethically</font>

529
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:49,850
acceptable to accept or transfer the

530
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,700
risk of a security breach rather than to

531
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:56,080
secure code congratulations you guys are

532
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,830
the affirmative here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks yeah it is I</font>

533
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not in all instances but</font>

534
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,820
it's not the questions asked you know it

535
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,919
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great like if you're a really</font>

536
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,178
small team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really big</font>

537
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:09,770
security problem but you're really

538
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to sell the customers like you</font>

539
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,809
should totally just accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk I</font>

540
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:16,039
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that is correct and you</font>

541
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:21,470
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like increase your user</font>

542
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:24,320
base first before fixing the problem is

543
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,870
is blaming Oracle acceptable in this can

544
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:32,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">you just like can I just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a Cohen</font>

545
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">be done also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyers exist and they</font>

546
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:44,000
generally more right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security people</font>

547
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:46,549
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money in jail so we do</font>

548
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time in our daily lives you</font>

549
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:50,418
have auto insurance so that if you are a

550
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:53,029
bad driver and you crash into somebody

551
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:54,860
somebody else will pay the hefty bill we

552
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:56,960
do this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our daily lives everywhere</font>

553
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,500
else it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font>

554
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,500
software security

555
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:09,700
I would argue it's not just ethically

556
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:13,659
all right i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's required to</font>

557
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:15,669
transfer your accept risk because

558
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:28,499
otherwise do you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact on</font>

559
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:28,499
short-term rhythms be horrible all right

560
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:38,320
sailor pork in them right so Dan brings

561
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:39,789
up a great point about doing this in our

562
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">daily lives and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see this</font>

563
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:44,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">right with what they're arguing is that</font>

564
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:46,330
you know for instance VW you know puts

565
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,799
out a TDI and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer</font>

566
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,658
the risk of that to all their customers

567
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,389
or say screw you go park submissions to

568
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,309
ask yourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we as a society we</font>

569
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,080
we have agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're responsible</font>

570
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:57,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that defect that they've been</font>

571
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,869
introduced into their product they've

572
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,939
they've given to their customers and

573
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:03,428

accountability to fix that just like

575
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:08,679
software vendors do with their breeches

576
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:10,600
in their poor code so let's extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

577
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,519
insurance metaphor for a second so I can

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,609
drive like an asshole and never have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a that</font>

580
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:18,789
actually there's a cost to it as well

581
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,940
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just transferring risk you're</font>

582
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:23,710
transferring the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost so effectively</font>

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,409
arguing the other side is arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

done so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would just like to quote our</font>

quoting John Vinson saying that you know

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all about giving a shit</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job kind of holistically so</font>

yeah I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my hippie on and</font>

00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:51,119
leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point to the</font>

605
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,179
you try to shirk that in as a business

individual responsibility you know I

626

love signing those ulos and I'm like

reading them all the way down like boom

like I know that I am the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that's</font>

over<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in so when you pass the</font>

634
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,390
more hands up both passes through the

635
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,280
more the cost is gonna rise so each time

636
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,680
you pass that security breach down the

637
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,450
line it got more expensive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix in</font>

638
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,100
that moment and it got more expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

639
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,160
fix down the line when you actually have

640
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:32,549
to deal with it that's still America

641
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,589
baby and our opposition talks about

642
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,870
insurance the part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> insurance is</font>

643
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,850
that you pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> more when you don't fix it</font>

644
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,140
so that's part of the structure if

645
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,460
you're you're a bad driver your

646
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,930
insurance rates go up because you're

647
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,780
accepting that and that's part of the

648
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:49,020
structure I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on the</font>

649
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,090
opposing teams reference to liberty and

650
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,270
freedom they do have the right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

651
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,270
wrong

652
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:02,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright if you guys thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

653
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,180
affirmative team has the best argument

654
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:09,880
give it up America red white and blue

655
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,080
stars and stripes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay if you guys</font>

656
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">all to negative team had the best</font>

657
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:21,700
argument give it up bunch of communist I

658
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:26,470
sheesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right the good news is it is</font>

659
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,689
now 32 two so position number<font color="#E5E5E5"> six when</font>

660
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,939
forced to choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> staff analysis of code</font>

661
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:34,870
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more beneficial than dynamic</font>

662
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:43,750
scanning of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application you guys are</font>

663
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:45,970
on the affirmative come on white noise

664
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,410
really who has hooves actually use

665
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,640
dynamic scanning and gotten some real

666
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:50,319
benefit out of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and by the way I work</font>

667
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:59,859
for mega vendor who sells a dynamic

668
00:37:50,320 --> 00:38:03,130
scanning application yes sort of in the

669
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:06,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuous delivery spirit of our</font>

670
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:10,900
competitors are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask you</font>

671
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,150
know where do you start many of us are

672
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,040
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the journey so maybe it is we</font>

673
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,950
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit our code before we can</font>

674
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,500
think about anything dynamic maybe we

675
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:23,049
just need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that static scan</font>

676
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,210
before we can even begin to consider how

677
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use a dynamic tool because we must</font>

678
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:31,030
start from somewhere so if you're not

679
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:35,170
already a unicorn running<font color="#E5E5E5"> your dynamic</font>

680
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:42,970
rainbow oops around maybe static is the

681
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:44,920
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually start with the key</font>

682
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,899
value here is is the level of visibility

683
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,520
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis is going to provide a</font>

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,860
level of visibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic</font>

685
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,590
analyzer does not have into the source

686
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,000
code itself and using static analysis is

687
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,220
going to give you that insight that a

688
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,920
dynamic analysis school isn't isn't

689
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,399
capable of providing so it's going to

690
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">find things that identify</font>

691
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,579
will not and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to find them and</font>

692
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,480
model them in ways that a dynamic

693
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,579
analyzer could not ever do and and as as

694
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,049
a boy pointed out we can find those

695
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,880
things earlier in the development life

696
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:19,890
cycle before we actually deploy the code

697
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,630
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right and frankly static</font>

698
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,339
analysis gets you out of the whole

699
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps thing you can control it at the</font>

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:36,750
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> level and that's a women and</font>

701
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:41,598
and it requires talented professionals

702
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,599
like this audience to do static analysis

703
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:52,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right negative team your response</font>

704
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:55,920
please clearly static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> is better</font>

705
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:59,010
because gives you that code<font color="#CCCCCC"> bubbly we're</font>

706
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:03,510
dynamic councils<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what do you really</font>

707
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:06,089
need is insight into the running system

708
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:11,309
so you can find<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-world exploitable</font>

709
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:14,119
vulnerabilities how can you not believe

710
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,119
a guy they can switch that

711
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:27,500
so static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis is useful when you</font>

712
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:31,010
can actually get access to code most

713
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,600
security professionals that that are

714
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">running tests against these applications</font>

715
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,750
are running against production or sadly

716
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,190
and so there is no ability to get to

717

<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Static is useless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you only have</font>

719
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,650
dynamic as your options yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who in</font>

720
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,150
the audience sorry i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

721
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,480
pander to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just going to make</font>

00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:57,130
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> life facts available to you who in</font>

723
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,160
the audience uses static code analysis

724
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:03,590
yeah okay great now when those static

725
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:06,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis tools run what does generate is</font>

726
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,730
it a PDF how many how many people would

727
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,440
say that usually you get a PDF or some

728
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,800
sort of large document of that static

729
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:18,500
analysis tool no no no takers on that

730
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:21,140
one yeah well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's right</font>

731
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I think they're like what</font>

732
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,890
generally comes what happens in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

733
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,510
static analysis world is you run it and

734
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,339
then like you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hours later</font>

735
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:32,450
days later you come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

736
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh 400 pages if you're lucky PDF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

737
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything like oh that's really that's</font>

738
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,800
going to be great to fix all that and

739
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,029
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you start going</font>

740
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the results are like how much of</font>

741
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,380
this code is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in use or</font>

742
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,030
like LinkedIn or it's like oh this is

743
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> some random dependencies wrapped in</font>

00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not actually being called anywhere</font>

745
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,540
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

746
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,070
positive case for static code analysis

747
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,660
this is the boringest<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor pitch I've</font>

748
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,640
ever heard

749
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:02,538
I feel like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time James</font>

750
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:06,170
low-caste actual was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,000 all</font>

751
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:10,250
right you guys good our time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

write good<font color="#E5E5E5"> coves secure code so a static</font>

when you check code in and to get

760
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,480
warnings and errors out of it so you

761
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:41,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually train people to write better</font>

764
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,308
there's lots of other tool available

765
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,220
like third fix that will help you

775
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:16,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to point out that James did admit</font>

778
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:28,700
dynamic scanners can also pass data

779
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,359
through thread fix the thread fix does

780
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:33,919
not make a tool better than another tool

781
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:36,950
it does make it better overall prescribe

782
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,829
fix is awesome but it is not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

783
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:42,890
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results better the</font>

784
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:44,270
security results still are lacking with

785
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,118
your static analysis tool you get a lot

786
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:49,339
of nonsense issues reported to you that

787
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,079
aren't security issues or that have

00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">other compensating controls in other</font>

789
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,460
parts of the code but they don't get you

793
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:05,430
the running application can act

794
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,570
we interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it see what's happening</font>

795
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,819
and actually find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

out of right out of its report that you

798
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,730
can actually play with and see right

799
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,830
away and it can also plug into your CI

800
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,010
as well so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just clearly</font>

801
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,720

flash it's closed source you see where

830
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:07,200
this is going hmm like sure there have

831
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,730
been some examples where things haven't

832
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,790
been great but the closest ones are

833
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:14,430
generally far far more awful like is TV

834
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,779
too good<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh justjust postgres is the</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eau de cool come at me open source</font>

everyone who's not bad guys it is real

843

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:08,740
avian the most popular hypervisor in the

00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:11,500
world currently kvm is at 13 million

865

five hundred thousand lines of code

866
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,299
that's a lot of code if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

875
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,759
commits per month on kvm that's an awful

882
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:04,240
almost everyone haven't have used one a

883
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,609
library where it stopped being

884
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,709
maintained because no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> was updating</font>

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,420
help maintain it

889
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,130
all I could say is I've looked at every

fucking option<font color="#CCCCCC"> whereas with closest you</font>

907
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,780
don't and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that company goes out of</font>

908

business you are so screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or as if</font>

909
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,590
open source thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not maintained you</font>

910
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,570
can maintain it or you can pay someone

911
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,400
else to maintain it that is why open

912
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,350
source is more secure because it gives

913
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,820
you the power to do these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be doing them but you have that option</font>

921
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,030
yourself or paying someone to do so yeah

922

924
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:12,369
point for is there openssl was one of

stepped up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain it and the code</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still shit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so if you thought</font>

936
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:07,339
eight critical vulnerabilities should

937
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:14,238
always be disclosed responsibly you guys

938
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:17,109
have the affirmative uses the word

939
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:23,420
responsible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term disclosure is</font>

940
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:30,019
irresponsible I just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am sorry opposite</font>

941
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:33,440
as we internet enable and computerize

942
00:52:30,019 --> 00:52:38,569
more and more things with more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

943
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:40,630
common code when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out a</font>

mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that vulnerabilities not in a</font>

946
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:48,440
pacemaker we have a responsibility we

947
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:52,459
talked about ethics before we have a

948
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:54,650
responsibility to<font color="#E5E5E5"> disclose in a</font>

coordinated manner allergic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that word</font>

950
00:52:54,650 --> 00:53:00,140
even on that side to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

951
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:01,880
vendors have an opportunity to solve

952
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:05,359
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the end user has an</font>

953
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:07,069
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mitigate problems we need</font>

954
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to act like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adults part of the reason</font>

955
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:14,529
that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us don't get invited to</font>

956
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:17,299
Capitol Hill besides our<font color="#CCCCCC"> fios is that</font>

957
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:20,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we as a community aren't always</font>

958
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:24,319
responsible and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to be</font>

959
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:25,690
responsible yeah you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

960
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:29,269
loaded question because the word

961
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:30,890
responsible is not exactly well defined

962
00:53:29,269 --> 00:53:32,629
here so it really depends upon what we

963
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,368
mean by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you a load but</font>

964
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you did get a lot of his eye</font>

965
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:41,880
hey it's not fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> but here's the thing</font>

966
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,038
though is that it particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

967
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,989
said jack is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there with the IOT</font>

968
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:48,180
connected cars pacemakers it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> olympos</font>

969
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">ness whatever that whatever it is it can</font>

970
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,089
have a material effect on a physical

971
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:53,130
safety so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to give to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

972
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:54,480
some opportunity and the user some

973
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:56,549
opportunity to solve the problems before

974
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,859
we actually release into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

975
00:53:56,549 --> 00:54:00,779
community so but I will say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

976
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:02,670
responsible can also mean limit

977
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,259
disclosure within the community

978
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,869
depending on who you who you disclosed

979
00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:12,119
to so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket to the point of</font>

980
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:13,440
definition all right there your key how

981
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,920
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

983
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,289
remember cobbles exactly that's why you

984
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want responsible disclosure</font>

985
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:28,470
because that period was awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop in</font>

00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:30,299
oh dayum people drop in schools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

yeah you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole responsibility</font>

996
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:14,260
thing just sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way for people</font>

997
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:17,140
to delay disclosure until it doesn't

998
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter anymore and so I think we need to</font>

999
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:23,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">disclose quickly not responsively we got</font>

1000
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,970
to get things out there quickly so

1001
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,040
people could start dealing with it not

1002
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,618
this responsibly that's legalese that's

1003
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:34,090
that's Capitol Hill talk for let's hide

1004
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:35,859
it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years it's like I mean we're</font>

1005
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:38,170
right by doing this you're basically

1006
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:46,470
invoking more lawyers into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your into</font>

1007
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:52,270
your life like who wants that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

1008
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:55,299
as a non security guy I sort of see the

1009
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:57,070
word responsibly as immediately if I

1010
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,960
have one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those pacemakers the first</font>

1011
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,300
thing I want to do is run away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my</font>

1012
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,830
wife I you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to count on</font>

1013
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,660
the fact that somebody might not know

1014
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:08,009
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter</font>

1015
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,009
maybe I should walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1016
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:17,920
wow I cracked me up<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so um so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1017
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,439
want to know because you know what if

1018
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,600
that vulnerability is already known i'm

1019
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,640
already at risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

1020
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,060
manage my own risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

1021
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:33,850
to do that at the right time so maybe

1022
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:35,350
responsibility is immediately but with

1023
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:38,290
the great power<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find vulnerabilities</font>

1024
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:45,190
we have the responsibility to manage

1025
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:46,390
that respondent and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

1033
