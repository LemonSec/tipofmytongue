1
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,429
thank you good afternoon everyone I have

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,399
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had with live music on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bill so</font>

3
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:29,799
this I have to entertain<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,949
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a choice here so thanks for</font>

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction as Austin stead I said</font>

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,690
I'm CTO for data privacy and security

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:39,159
within our security division and today

8
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,250
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk about security and</font>

9
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,079
privacy for big data and since I'm from

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,850
Southern California Redondo Beach to be

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,040
precise I thought I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would start with a</font>

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,989
surfing analogy that's not one of my

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,210
paintings I'm not that good that's a

14
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:56,050
photograph and does<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone recognize</font>

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:01:00,460
that even know what that is so that was

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:04,089
a guy who served<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest wave ever</font>

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,369
known to be served 90 feet I mean can

18
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,500
you imagine like when the waves are

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:10,509
above seven feet I'm kind of not going

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,190
to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surf I boogie</font>

21
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:14,740
board but still you know I know my

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,929
limits the reason I have that is the

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,589
surfing analogy is this is it's just

24
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:22,149
like agreeing on the definition of what

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,130
big data is it's just like getting a

26
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,080
group of surfers to agree on what is the

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect wave because everybody's got a</font>

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,429
different definition and they're all

29
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,069
highly dependent on your perception your

30
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:36,190
skills your your experience and then

31
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:38,349
your goals and until early 2003 no one

32
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,940
thought that that was possible but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

33
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:42,190
know how they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they started using</font>

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,989
jet skis to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tow the servers out and</font>

35
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,200
that's what they do whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> chopped</font>

36
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ooh out in the South Pacific or this is</font>

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,429
our Garvey off the coast of Portugal

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,399
these guys have these high-powered jet

39
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:56,470
skis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and then off they go</font>

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,050
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing around</font>

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,660
big data that you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

42
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">this perfect computing mega wave because</font>

43
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,920
you've got this ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

44
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,270
together all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information and do</font>

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,940
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're never thought possible</font>

46
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,040
before but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also potentially very</font>

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,470
dangerous and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it can be a bit</font>

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,179
scary but there are some challenges with

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,010
big data first of all the name is

50
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,129
completely inaccurate it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">be big to be big data and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

52
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,870
lot of vendor hype and you know at some

53
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,460
points it gets absolutely ridiculous so

54
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,230
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about separating the</font>

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,670
height from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality what you know</font>

56
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,140
what are people really doing with big

57
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,000
data and then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of the</font>

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,549
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and privacy concerns and</font>

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,680
controls so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of skip</font>

60
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,390
ahead a little bit let's do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like a</font>

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,760
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hands around the room</font>

62
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,910
how many of you work with Hadoop before

63
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,019
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

64
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea what a dupe is just a couple so we</font>

65
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">can skip the basic stuff I'm totally</font>

66
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,020
fine with that oh we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a whole</font>

67
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of late folks come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in i'm so</font>

68
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:01,810
glad to see you instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of watching live</font>

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,550
music that's awesome I will do the short

70
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">history lesson because when I wrote the</font>

71
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,560
book I wrote the intro chapter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

72
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,200
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to uncover where</font>

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,900
big data came from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the term was</font>

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,000
first used back in 1997 it was an i

75
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,370
triple e paper on virtualization and

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,850
they defined the problem of big data so

77
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:25,510
back in 97 then a guy named Dudley<font color="#E5E5E5"> niet</font>

78
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:29,109
Gartner in 2001 he coined the<font color="#E5E5E5"> term about</font>

79
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:32,170
velocity variety volume of<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data then</font>

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,450
we flash forward to 2014 MapReduce is

81
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,569
invented which is this paradigm this

82
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,390
this programming method of taking you

83
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,609
know huge inexpensive clusters of linux

84
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,829
boxes and splitting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the workload and</font>

85
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,959
being able to drive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> owe as fast</font>

86
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,670
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you possibly can that's really what</font>

87
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,340
big data is all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know</font>

88
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,589
driving that volume going fast fast fast

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,400
and then doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more sophisticated</font>

90
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:59,530
processing then what so that was in 2004

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,730
my map and that was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys from</font>

92
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:07,090
google then 2005 we have Hadoop and HDFS

93
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,069
which of course is cutting and most of

94
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,560
you may know that Hadoop is named for

95
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,030
his sons pet elephant stuffed elephant

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,100
that is

97
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:19,950
real one so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to talk about</font>

98
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 5 v's of what we really consider big</font>

99
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,360
data because everybody is different

100
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition of what it is and IBM what we</font>

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,910
define it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as extracting insight from an</font>

102
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,260
immense volume variety and velocity of

103
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:37,260
data in context before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that beyond what</font>

104
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,480
was previously possible big data comes

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,039
from many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different sources we've got</font>

106
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,410
your traditional and transaction

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,410
application data a lot of clients are

108
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,210
just stuffing Hadoop environments with

109
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,650
old transactional data thinking they'll

110
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,260
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it at some point</font>

111
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that throw it on you</font>

112
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,340
know in there and then see what we do

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,320
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it machine data you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

114
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,380
last two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years since i first wrote this</font>

115
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> updating it machine data</font>

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,290
and internet of things you know that is

117
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,930
going to drive way beyond volume we even

118
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,220
know about today social day the same

119
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,139
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but there's a lot more</font>

120
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,960
variety of it like how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind a</font>

121
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,910
tweet how do you do text type searching

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,140
to look for proximity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of words and</font>

123
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,479
that's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work we've been</font>

124
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,700
doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Watson it sits around text</font>

125
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,469
analytics and then we have enterprise

126
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,070
content and that could be virtually

127
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,140
anything from images etc so there's

128
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,520
really a wide wide variety of what we

129
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:38,280
consider big data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be this plethora of</font>

130
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,380
ideas around information and getting

131
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,789
inside out of it there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font>

132
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,190
that's missing in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

133
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,190
discussions and that's the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,190
business value and earlier this<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

135
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,660
Gartner did a little survey to say you

136
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what what are the inhibitors for</font>

137
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,970
you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data and it's it's getting</font>

138
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,010
value out of it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of executives</font>

139
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,169
business executives are going well this

140
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,500
is cool but you know show<font color="#CCCCCC"> me something</font>

141
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:07,109
that gives me value and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

142
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,560
what what I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of organizations</font>

143
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,330
are not quite mature yet and it's also I

144
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of organizations aren't</font>

145
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,080
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot in the area of security</font>

146
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,409
quite yet because they're still trying

147
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,810
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do with it so</font>

148
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,889
those of you who work with Hadoop how

149
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,389
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have Hadoop in</font>

150
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:31,090
production production now yeah

151
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,699
production now not really I saw like one

152
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,169
and a half hands thats exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

153
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,659
seeing as well when I talked to my

154
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,400
clients around North America they're

155
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,469
still trying to figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and also a</font>

156
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,210
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Hadoop projects there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skunk</font>

157
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,759
work projects over in marketing and

158
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity we have no idea they're going</font>

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,050
on so there is also this really big

160
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,990
disconnect that up to me is very

161
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,639
disconcerting real briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk</font>

162
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,969
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value and some of the things</font>

163
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're seeing trends a lot</font>

164
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:01,810
of is about processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time data</font>

165
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,310
and streaming data and applying

166
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,110
algorithms whether that's fraud

167
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,090
detection when someone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to use</font>

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,210
your credit card it could be getting

169
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">that 360 degree view of a customer and</font>

170
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,799
their habits across what a lot of

171
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,110
retailers called multi-channel like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,969
start on you know my<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone and then</font>

173
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,909
later I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to browse on my iPad or my</font>

174
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:23,770
computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I can do that some</font>

175
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,839
very interesting work around predicting

176
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,719
weather patterns whether it's for

177
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,990
planning locations of turbines or oil

178
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:35,439
rigs or using that to do predictive work

179
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,879
around disaster planning etc so there's

180
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,259
some really amazing success stories most

181
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,939
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> health</font>

00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">care you know life-threatening</font>

183
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:48,789
conditions I can monitor all the devices

184
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,399
in a neonatal unit and I can predict

185
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:53,139
when things may change when this

186
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,509
situation may change and be proactive

187
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,879
about changing medication or changing

188
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:01,270
the care plan for an infant who's at

189
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,909
risk there now we get down a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

190
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we talk about the technology itself</font>

191
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:08,949
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of capabilities in</font>

192
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,539
Hadoop besides just what we call

193
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,399
MapReduce so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this</font>

194
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:14,080
federated discovery and navigation

195
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,969
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting you know what I'm</font>

196
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,289
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Bettina's different because a</font>

197
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:19,149
lot of times you're trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

198
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,399
what's interesting first and then decide

199
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,740
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to do about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's</font>

200
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,379
also as I said about storing massive

201
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,349
volumes of data the the newest trend

202
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:31,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache spark anyone</font>

203
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,150
know what a patchy spark so this is

204
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:35,250
taking a dupe

205
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,470
and you know putting it in memory it's a

206
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,570
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times faster hundred times</font>

207
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,880
faster and you can put it in the cloud

208
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,920
that you know that's changing our world

209
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,070
at IBM we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

210
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
around spark because you know it is a

211
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,890
little bit challenging when you're

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,660
deploying a Hadoop infrastructure

213
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,550
because you got a lot of hardware so

214
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,020
we're what I see going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is I think a</font>

215
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of clients are jumping and they're</font>

216
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,960
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> right from there not even</font>

217
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,820
experimenting they're going right into

218
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cloud and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

219
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,450
purpose built apps like now we have a

220
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Watson in the cloud you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

221
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,080
spreadsheet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll start you know</font>

222
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,430
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you information about that and</font>

223
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,890
answering questions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

224
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">about so more we'll be going into the</font>

225
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,710
cloud more risk the stream computing i

226
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,229
mentioned text analytics is becoming

227
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more important as we're ingesting</font>

228
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,870
more information and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also do see</font>

229
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,120
this challenge around integrating data

230
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,240
and especially making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that it's a</font>

231
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">high quality very briefly Hadoop is</font>

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,920
really an alphabet soup of components

233
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,120
there are and this changes all the time

234
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,229
what was MapReduce is now called yarn

235
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,870
every week there's there's new

236
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,640
components added you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

237
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,660
important ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably high that's</font>

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,720
the data warehouse for infrastructure

239
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:54,780
you know you've got HBase is a column

240
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,120
store and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do queries against it</font>

241
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,810
you even<font color="#CCCCCC"> now have big sequel and you can</font>

242
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,910
use jdbc drivers to do sequel queries<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

243
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,439
you know as app developers it starts

244
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,589
getting very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because how do</font>

245
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,660
you scan apps to figure out what it's

246
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,070
doing right you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times it's</font>

247
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a REST API and you don't</font>

248
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily know what's behind the</font>

249
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,980
scenes here's a sample big data

250
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,089
architecture and I say sample because

251
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,360
everybody's doing it a little

252
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,790
differently you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> one example could</font>

253
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,390
be data in motion<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm taking information</font>

254
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:31,760
feeds off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car assembly line for one</font>

255
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,560
auto manufacturer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm applying real time</font>

256
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,260
excuse me analytics to determine are

257
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,729
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any issues with quality so any</font>

258
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,400
kind of predictive quality and

259
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,940
maintenance that we can do to identify

260
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,620
potential problems on the

261
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,530
line so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your real time analytics</font>

262
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have some degree of data</font>

263
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,120
integration and in cleansing and

264
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,650
standardizing data and there's there's

265
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,150
two schools of thought on that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

266
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,709
what is just get it in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

267
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,750
doing some analytics quickly the other

268
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,550
is make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice and pretty and clean I</font>

269
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,160
think there's you know there's use cases

270
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,010
for both we call these areas landing

271
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,750
zones or analytic zones and when we get

272
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,060
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy approach a</font>

273
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,720
lot of what we do is around zoning and

274
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,199
fit for purpose security and privacy and

275
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,630
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases my clients are also</font>

276
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,690
taking not just to do but they're

277
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,890
putting either no sequel databases or

278
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,950
traditional data warehouses alongside

279
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,840
whether you know that's a teaser Oracle

280
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,570
teradata what have you and then you've

281
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like MongoDB you know as an example</font>

282
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,920
so we see a lot of this mixing of

283
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,709
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of databases and data</font>

284
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,680
sources that that people do consider

285
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote big data and the slides by</font>

286
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,329
the way are on PDF and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given them</font>

287
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,610
over Austin so you're you know you'll

288
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that material now front end</font>

289
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,670
what does it look like a lot of

290
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,110
analytics a lot of purpose-built tools

291
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,240
exploration type tools like you know

292
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,610
we've got one and there's there's tons

293
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,260
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of navigation and</font>

294
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,000
discovery what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is going to be</font>

295
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,819
most interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font>

296
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you is operationalizing it and when</font>

297
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,620
this gets into decision management where

298
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,690
I've got you know web portal and I need

299
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing real-time decisioning and</font>

300
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,660
feed in some analytic result that's

301
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,790
computed you know a customer's

302
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,310
propensity to upsell like maybe I want

303
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,110
to cross-sell Emma you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a car rental</font>

304
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,079
along with their trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Hawaii as an</font>

305
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:32,320
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I may want to look at their</font>

306
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,839
risk and then either you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know reject</font>

307
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,650
them for whatever reason or flag it as a

308
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,200
potential fraud situation all right now

309
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,530
we have this concept of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> lake</font>

310
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,930
versus a data reservoir a data lake is

311
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,140
the data like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the water flows it</font>

312
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,239
naturally and it just sits there that's

313
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,280
good and bad and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the data</font>

314
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
reservoir which is built to extract the

315
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,640
value from the

316
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,270
data as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said you know there's there's</font>

317
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,550
pros and cons that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lake it is</font>

318
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,680
can be really challenging because think

319
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,630
about the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and privacy exposures</font>

320
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,849
in there if you're stuffing all your

321
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,130
data in there you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

322
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,290
you're not vetting it and also if you're

323
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,300
ingesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party sources let's say</font>

324
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:18,430
you by third-party data you're not

325
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,540
vetting it you're exposing yourself to a

326
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:24,400
huge amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risk so you know I I</font>

327
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,680
advocate that data lakes are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if</font>

328
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,130
they're restricted use and they're used

329
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,229
very tightly you know that's okay but

330
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,910
really data without analytics is just a

331
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,230
liability so you know you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

332
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,209
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're going to be doing with</font>

333
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,920
that information regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

334
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,770
marketing tells you that they need the

335
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,420
data you know there's a huge risk and

336
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,000
typically your compliance and your

337
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">privacy office and you know risk and</font>

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,160
security will start taking a closer look

339
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,960
when it gets to production time so let's

340
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,319
move ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about security and</font>

341
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,020
privacy considerations now this this is

342
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,000
fun and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> as security privacy</font>

343
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,339
professionals our biggest challenge is

344
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,760
getting to these shadow IT organizations

345
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:09,070
and not being<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> department the</font>

346
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,110
n.o department but you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the KN</font>

347
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,330
0<font color="#CCCCCC"> W the one who's in the know who can</font>

348
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,370
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> help harmonize security and</font>

349
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,420
privacy with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to do</font>

350
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,950
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to hinder</font>

351
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,069
innovation but you want to make sure

352
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you protect it adequately so whoops</font>

353
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,200
let's go back so why is Big Data

354
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:30,160
different first of all I said more data

355
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,900
and more risk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the the more data</font>

356
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,750
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher risk of the breach</font>

357
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,740
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really interesting I keep</font>

358
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking every time I I present I look at</font>

359
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,339
you know and are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop</font>

360
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,980
breaches how their bidding adieu

361
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:48,040
breaches I haven't found any yet has

362
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,680
anybody this is so interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

363
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,719
like aren't the hackers figuring out<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

364
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,029
data they should learn you know Hadoop

365
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,550
and how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a Hadoop system and</font>

366
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:59,709
even the number of vulnerabilities this

367
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,290
will blow you away<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

368
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:06,529
vulnerability database says oh there's

369
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,860
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache to do</font>

370
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:13,430
vulnerabilities right now to from 2012

371
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:16,850
and two from 2014 there's two more for

372
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,489
more for cloud eras version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think for</font>

373
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,069
for horn works and then you know in

374
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,860
admission we have three so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

375
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:27,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">things going on that like I don't</font>

376
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,940
understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> why there isn't more</font>

377
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,560
attention paid and in doing more

378
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,569
research I think I'm getting some of the

379
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,000
answers but we'll get to that in just a

380
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:37,009
moment it's very immature there's a lot

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,110
less security governance discipline and

382
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,899
it's it's rapidly evolving there's an

383
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,880
article I put in there it's titled<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO</font>

385
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,220
security out why because they're trying

386
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to use it and so when</font>

387
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,670
you look at that this study i think it

388
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,230
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like two percent of them said that</font>

389
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,180
the you know what was preventing them

390
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,490
from moving ahead with<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadoop was with</font>

391
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,888
security it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's getting value but</font>

392
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,959
as i said as we go production it's

393
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:06,230
really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start hitting and that's</font>

394
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,810
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we haven't seen much in</font>

395
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that area but to give you an idea of how</font>

396
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:15,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">immature this area is in February of</font>

397
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:19,008
this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cloudera reported one cve</font>

398
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,069
vulnerability they store the ldap buying

399
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:24,769

400
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:26,599
open readable files under etsy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hadoop so</font>

401
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:30,560
local users can get at the password

402
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,600
hello I mean that's pretty bad so that's

403
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,599
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing and I</font>

404
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,399
would suggest you know making buddies

405
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,199
with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks or maybe bringing some</font>

406
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them in bring in some data scientists</font>

407
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,109
on board and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

408
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,630
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of security</font>

409
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">professionals are using Hadoop why to do</font>

410
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,160
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know because it's</font>

411
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,529
a great place to run a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of algorithms</font>

412
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,300
and see if you can find patterns we also

413
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this challenge with new types of</font>

414
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,229
data and new privacy implications

415
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,420
whether it's smart metering health

416
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,089
monitors connected home connected car

417
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,158
that you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential for privacy</font>

418
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,110
risks is really exponential and

419
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,780
legislation is not catching up with it

420
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,189
which is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that in the</font>

421
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,619
next

422
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">wyd and then there's new uses of data</font>

423
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,219
and that that is where it gets

424
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,480
challenging because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you change the</font>

425
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,100
use of data without changing your

426
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,310
privacy notice you're actually in

427
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:23,589
privacy violation and the FTC has come

428
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,599
after a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies for this and it</font>

429
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,389
can cost a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of it</font>

430
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,590
so that that brings the question is it

431
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,480
cool or is it creepy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love this</font>

432
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,459
she's kind of got this listening device

433
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,830
and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be hearing something really</font>

434
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,950
super interesting I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I actually</font>

435
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,770
was looking for googling for an image

436
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,720
cool or creepy and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this</font>

437
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage was written in Hungarian and the</font>

438
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,080
only thing I could recognize was the

439
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,660
name Glenn Greenwald's anyone who know

440
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,780
Glenn Greenwald is he broke the Snowden

441
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,910
story so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this</font>

442
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,889
image in here so that when i bring this

443
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,590
up it's because the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

444
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:04,960
collect can get unable us to get really

445
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool services or it can be super creepy</font>

446
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,380
so you know the great example is a

447
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,199
retailer target and they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

448
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,700
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> data scientists so their analytics</font>

449
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,740
were so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out a</font>

450
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,590
team was pregnant before her<font color="#E5E5E5"> father did</font>

451
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and it was a combination of</font>

452
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,100
purchasing under scented lotions and

453
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,770
large tote bags which could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used as</font>

454
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,040
diaper bags so they sent targeted ads to

455
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,629
her on those products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and dad called up</font>

456
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,899
so what are you doing they said oh well

457
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:38,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any rate you get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's</font>

458
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not illegal so I i call this</font>

459
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,459
privacy ethics it's really thinking

460
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's right and getting a</font>

461
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,720
consumer choice because some consumers

462
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,580
for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know sending diaper</font>

463
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,830
samples to a woman with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a newborn is</font>

464
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,550
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for a lot of people but</font>

465
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,770
you know it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not okay like</font>

466
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,300
getting unsolicited ads based on your

467
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:03,040
location or you know what about sending

468
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,870
baby food offers to someone who just

469
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,149
purchased a pregnancy test doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

470
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,280
make you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit queasy makes me</font>

471
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,320
queasy so you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think</font>

472
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that so let's move on and talk</font>

473
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the big data life cycle and where</font>

474
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,850
I see it starting and where it's going

475
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really been in this search and</font>

476
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">survey exploratory and analytics until</font>

477
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently</font>

478
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,559
and then when you stand it up is a

479
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,239
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment and goes</font>

480
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,040
operational guess what that's when you

481
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the call here we're going to hook up</font>

482
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,830
this new predictive analytics

483
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,650
application and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

484
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,320
security I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even now I'm working on</font>

485
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,179
several projects with our analytics

486
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,730
group where they're putting together

487
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,770
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you know making sure</font>

488
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they want to incorporate security</font>

489
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,820
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because why they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying</font>

490
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,070
to you know work on the analytics part

491
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,649
first so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this as fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

492
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,919
purpose security and privacy where we

493
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,500
start from the this realm of initial use

494
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,929
cases and then we move to using for

495
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,270
business decisions and typically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning realize that Hadoop was</font>

497
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,820
invented to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be behind a big old firewall</font>

498
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,590
used by a handful users in a highly

499
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,899
secure environment so security<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

500
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,850
wasn't put in there by design and now

501
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes so we you know we do need</font>

502
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about it quite a bit more</font>

503
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,080
the change management is also sporadic

504
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,540
no data retention requirements no

505
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,100
regulation just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get that data</font>

506
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,230
and they are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now it's interesting</font>

507
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">well now we have to think about all</font>

508
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,240
these other aspects whether it's

509
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:36,460
encrypting auditing making sure you

510
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,770
preserve data for a period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

511
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,110
that brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of quick</font>

512
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,270
slides on privacy because a lot of folks

513
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,879
confuse what privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security are</font>

514
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,220
and I think of privacy as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Y in the</font>

515
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,710
what and the security is the how so

516
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,270
privacy is basically figuring out making

517
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure your information that you get is</font>

518
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,100
accurate it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> safeguarded you limit the</font>

519
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,860
access you honor the choices of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

520
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,770
owner and also on how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is</font>

521
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:05,139
shared and disposed of and data security

522
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,520
is the technical safeguards so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

523
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know they're there is a lot of</font>

524
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,450
overlap because of course you have to

525
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security for privacy you don't have</font>

526
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have privacy for security and that</font>

527
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,290
brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the question of what is</font>

528
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered personal PII and it depends</font>

529
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,460
and as you're developing and working in

530
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,740
big data environments this is absolutely

531
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,920
critical to understand that anything

532
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,140
that identifies an individual is

533
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,880
considered personal information anything

534
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and our challenge in the u.s. is we have</font>

535
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,850
47 states that have breach notification

536
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:42,180
Shin laws three of them don't and the

537
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:45,209
initials are an essay how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

538
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,530
that's kind of strange isn't it but each

539
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of those states has different</font>

540
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,980
regulations and of course the u.s.

541
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,480
different regulations and if you follow

542
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,430
the news you know that a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,470

545
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,680
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> struck down so you know and a lot it</font>

546
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,620
has to do with you know things that

547
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen let's just say prism and so you</font>

548
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,320
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about what is personal and</font>

549
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:13,770
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much anything and even cell</font>

550
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,750
phone location there's a study three

551
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:18,060
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of human</font>

552
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,010
mobility data and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to have</font>

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">million individuals with hourly data</font>

554
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,720
points guess how many data points were

needed to uniquely identify ninety-five

556

percent of the individuals how many

00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,670
points anyone want to guess three you're

559
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,440
very close it's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't scare</font>

560
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you have your app tracking on</font>

561
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,610
like pardon me but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

562
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,080
an app there's no need to track

563
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,300
someone's location if you're not using

564
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,270
it unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give permission so that's</font>

565
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my take on it any rate I've said</font>

566
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,410
enough on that so here's the big red

567
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,850
caution make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your legal</font>

568
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,220
and compliance because it really is a

569
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,290
legal compliance policy issue to decide

570
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,170
what is and what isn't and it's also

571
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,060
about risk all right now we get to the

572
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,240
technical part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation and</font>

573
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:07,770
we deep dive down very quickly so what's

574
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,990
the architecture for security and

575
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy for big data well it really is</font>

576
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,600
going to depend it depends on your

577
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,939
implementation your priorities and your

578
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,159
risk appetite<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to clients</font>

579
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,610
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would advise them on what are</font>

580
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,380
the common controls and what I recommend

581
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:28,139
and you know they may not implement all

582
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,330
of them now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a big old chart</font>

583
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,480
and it basically says security security

584
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:36,360
the same disciplines apply but dot dot

585
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,210
dot so in the in the stack we start with

586
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,459
the risk you know risk and compliance

587
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,310
governance risk and compliance that's

588
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,180
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the same its policies</font>

589
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,320
security and intelligence and analytics

590
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,090
yeah pretty

591
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,330
much to save if you're using a sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

592
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,428
alerting you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the same</font>

593
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,860
identity and access management<font color="#CCCCCC"> its mess</font>

594
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:58,620
I have to tell you it is highly highly

595
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">and mature most of dupe at least I'm</font>

596
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,668
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dupe the no sequels and</font>

597
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:04,080
the databases are quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better but</font>

598
00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:06,679
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them are relying on</font>

599
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,389
either a combination of Kerberos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> os</font>

600
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,820
there are some open source projects like

601
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:14,820
a patchy century and apache<font color="#E5E5E5"> Knox gateway</font>

602
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,830
and that can help with them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

603
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,870
also role-based access control with

604
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,360
century and Ranger<font color="#E5E5E5"> two other open source</font>

605
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:25,289
projects so that you know that that does

606
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,389
really help but still it's highly highly

607
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:28,889
incomplete and very immature and I

608
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:32,428
believe it will be evolving more and

609
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:33,928
more now data security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy this</font>

610
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:37,620
is actually more mature and I'll tell

611
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:39,840
you why because in data security and

612
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy until pretty recently was kind</font>

613
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,149
of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data organization and even in</font>

614
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:47,039
IBM our data security products were in

615
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:49,258
the analytics organization until January

616
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,408
this year so there's recognition that

617
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,779
data security has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be part of the rest</font>

618
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:58,440
of security why well a lot of security

619
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,820
came out of network admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> TSA's admins</font>

620
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,830
and then app developers who are

621
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,200
interested in hacking and not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

622
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,110
the DBA crowd so that's that's changed

623
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,120
quite a bit we still see a patchwork of

624
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,979
vendors who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing their own stuff</font>

625
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that makes it hard when you manage</font>

626
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,940
an infrastructure so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

they travel all over the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to a</font>

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,178
lot of folks and I said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

635
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,230
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dupe are you singing like what</font>

636
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,870
are you seeing and they're like

637
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,970
not really seeing much unless you know

638
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">how is that possible I think there's two</font>

639
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,040
reasons one is that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks are</font>

640
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:46,350
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying purpose-built apps they're</font>

641
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,059
not production<font color="#E5E5E5"> I using stuff yet they're</font>

642
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,030
not doing the integration that's one

643
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,740
reason I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other is that a lot</font>

644
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're seeing is just calling</font>

645
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,960
REST API it's just a REST API and

646
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,570
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON you know and it it</font>

647
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,850
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really look that different so a</font>

648
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,500
lot of what we're seeing is doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

649
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,799
that different from from your side of

650
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,669
the fence<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I still kind of wonder you</font>

651
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:14,400
know why is it that we're not seeing a

652
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:17,220
lot of work being<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apps sec for</font>

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hadoop specifically and you know if</font>

654
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,280
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to me afterwards I'd</font>

655
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:26,010
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> your insight into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

656
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,750
do see more of this authentication with

657
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:30,210
Pam and ldap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to mention that</font>

658
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,890
and then infrastructure protection it's

659
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it's the network so</font>

660
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,940
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking that thing's</font>

661
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,830
pretty much the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> advanced for our</font>

662
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,380
protection we use that quite a bit with

663
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:43,290
Hadoop now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop</font>

664
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,230
security architecture and you'll see

665
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:48,330
some of the common elements that are in

666
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,160
the standard world of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

667
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,649
structured world whether that's the

<font color="#E5E5E5">network security audit logging alerting</font>

669
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:58,950
encryption authentication admin and

670
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,620
configuration certificate management

671
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,880
pretty much the same but<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I said you</font>

672
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,229
know the challenge is bringing that

673
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,330
together with what you already have in

674
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,210
the enterprise in it it really isn't

675
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy leave it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting</font>

676
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:13,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">better but still you know there's</font>

677
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,830
challenges and and recognize you're

678
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,630
dealing with both static data at rest so

679
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,460
maybe masking an addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to encryption</font>

680
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,860
and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got dynamic data you've</font>

681
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,210
got data flowing and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I feel</font>

682
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,969
pretty strongly that in the world of

683
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,679
security we've done a terrible job of

684
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,809
security on data flows and understanding

685
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,950
data flows and especially as they relate

686
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:37,770
to managing privacy controls so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

687
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of the challenge is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a dupe</font>

688
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,790
is matured the avenues to get into the

689
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,710
cluster of changed it used to be that

690
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,230
you'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through the central you</font>

691
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:47,290
know the

692
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,910
the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> note to get the stuff and now</font>

693
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,290
not so much you pretty much go

694
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,910
everywhere else because it's the

695
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,379
interest of performance so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

696
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,090
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean it means you've got to put</font>

697
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,860
agents on every one of those notes to

698
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,500
monitor so that you know there's a

699
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,449
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so what</font>

700
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the privacy and security core</font>

701
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,370
disciplines that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> observing</font>

702
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:08,168
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our clients doing and you know</font>

703
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,629
where are the more mature products and

704
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,309
what can you actually do first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

705
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,070
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know where your sensitive data is</font>

706
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:17,740
and who has access<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's still not</font>

707
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,290
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do because the way that</font>

708
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,940
JSON is structured you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

709
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">look for the data and then the data</font>

710
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,990
elements and understand what they are

711
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,790
and I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know to IBM</font>

712
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,400
we're still working on a lot of that we

713
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,990
do have methods to do it that take a

714
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,490
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> work and it has to do</font>

715
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,049
with using text analytics so we

716
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,660
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use around text analytics</font>

717
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,360
to go crawl and look for stuff then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

718
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,340
need to classify the assets and quantify

719
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,918
the risk you got to quantify the risk

720
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,290
against the value decide about the

721
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,760
vulnerabilities and then decide how

722
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,428
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect it and I talked</font>

723
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,379
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity and access management</font>

724
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:55,900
the big one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity monitoring and</font>

725
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,460
that is has developed very well over the

726
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,919
last couple of years we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

727
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with clients from you know credit</font>

728
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,480
card companies to even to pet retailers

729
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,799
surprisingly enough they there they want

730
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,950
to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that customer data</font>

731
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,960
doesn't come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption I think we</font>

732
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,910
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about encryption pros and cons</font>

733
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,340
I'm not going to talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font>

734
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:18,250
see more reduction and masking going on

735
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,049
so hiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and obscuring data walking</font>

736
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:22,120
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the environments even segmenting</font>

737
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:24,010
the network i also think that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

738
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,510
the reason that Hadoop hasn't been

739
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,669
breached as much as probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

740
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,490
networks are segmented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're kind</font>

741
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:32,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of off to the side and so that reduces</font>

742
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,870
the risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> but again as we go to</font>

743
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,909
production you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we really got to be</font>

744
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:38,559
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

745
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,809
the monitoring and auditing whether it's

746
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,080
defining your metrics and auditing and

747
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,850
reporting for compliance etc I believe

748
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,070
that real-time data<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity monitoring</font>

749
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,350
in the world of Hadoop is absolutely

750
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,720
critical and that's this concept of

751
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,850
capturing the the network traffic teeing

752
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,430
off the network traffic with it a jet

753
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,010
not

754
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:00,830
with a span port and monitoring the

755
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:04,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">reeds the rights who's doing what and</font>

756
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:07,129
then being able to alert report on or

757
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,770
even block on that bad traffic and that

758
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,630
i'll leave you to read some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text</font>

759
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,490
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that approach has been working</font>

760
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,800
very very well again<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bigger</font>

761
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,090
challenge was as we adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the newer</font>

762
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,010
architectures having to install the

763
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,449
monitoring agents on every node and now

764
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,310
we know we're able to automate that

765
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,930
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing so here's an</font>

766
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">example this is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of our tools</font>

767
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:32,450
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guardium and what it does is it</font>

768
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically captures all this traffic into</font>

769
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,040
a hard and repository on an appliance

770
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,980
and then you can run reports and you can

771
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,930
lurk look for certain users you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can look</font>

772
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">for certain activity and you can also</font>

773
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,430
use machine learning to figure out what

774
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,410
are those unusual patterns and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

775
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">apologize the blacks a little hard to</font>

776
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:54,200
read but basically when a privileged

777
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,480
user tries to read customer data and you

778
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,700
know that's detected via policy we're

779
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,710
able to block so we can put policies in

780
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,840
place that look for specific IP

781
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:05,990
addresses that are you know not

782
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,230
whitelisted look for specific access to

783
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,850
data elements you see it a sequel select

784
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,300
there that's cause a lot of Hadoop has

785
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,800
sequel interfaces now so blocking I

786
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,620
think monitoring a blocking is a good

787
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,520
way to go and then last but not least

788
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,620
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk data data obfuscation and the</font>

789
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,139
massive confusion about what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

790
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,270
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways to do it one is</font>

791
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,040
masking where you substitute the value

792
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,170
for something fictitious that looks real

793
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,510
that came out of the world of test data

794
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,980
management and you know in test

795
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,800
databases you really shouldn't have

796
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,740
credit cards and and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

797
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well in Hadoop whether dynamically</font>

798
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,460
or statically you can also read act so

799
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:51,320
put little X's or asterisks etc

800
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,470
tokenization something that gets used

801
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:57,290
pros and cons you know pros easy cons

802
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,800
performance and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friend</font>

803
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,970
encryption so here's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

804
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,490
take an SSN

805
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,710
and in I have tables here is basically

806
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a dupe being able to apply</font>

807
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:12,050
a bunch of algorithms to very quickly

808
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,479
mask that data here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one this</font>

809
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of using redaction with</font>

810
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Impala and hive and I can basically</font>

811
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:23,960
capture that network data stream look

812
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,640
for string reg s regex expressions and

813
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,450
you know you could use pre-built ones

814
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,040
and then redact that so that a

815
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,750
non-authorized user will not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

816
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,080
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a roll</font>

817
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">in policy type basis then when you put</font>

818
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,250
it all together it becomes a lot of fun

819
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that is you might want to front end</font>

820
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,400
it with an information catalog so

821
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:47,060
business users know what the information

822
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,950
is classified that data and then decide

823
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,500
how you're going to process it normally

824
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:55,070
my best recommendation is if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre</font>

825
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,320
process it on the way in and you know

826
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,570
apply your rules on the way in whether

827
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,879
it's masking or cleansing that's a good

828
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing and anonymizing you know there's a</font>

829
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of data you can anonymize like that</font>

830
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,240
location data you really don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

831
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:12,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's me who's using my Fitbit</font>

832
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,660
or what other device and then of course

833
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:17,600
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time alerting and the</font>

834
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,870
activity monitoring over<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top some</font>

835
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,639
final words of advice is no your data

836
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">and understand the data and the trust</font>

837
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,190
factor and decide how you're going to

838
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,590
operationalize it do a privacy impact in

839
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,990
a security risk assessment and then

840
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,389
decide what controls are going to use

841
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not a one size fit off it's</font>

842
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">all you're wasting your time if you're</font>

843
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,440
locking down data that is not useless to

844
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:44,060
anybody so that's that's some good

845
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,650
things and then there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

846
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:50,179
recommended approaches for monitoring

847
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:52,220
and finally keys to success is managing

848
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:56,180
that security and privacy at your point

849
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact and understanding that you</font>

850

00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,540
safeguard information no matter what and

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I do believe that Hadoop is very</font>

853

you need you do your<font color="#CCCCCC"> homework and then</font>

855
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:11,480
you look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> solutions that are going to</font>

00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that you talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends who</font>

860
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,940
are doing this work because you really

861
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,800
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be surprised at the last</font>

862
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,300
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

863
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,770
be surprised when a breach happens

864
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,190
because nobody was paying any attention

865
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:30,009
to the security in that environment so

866
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,980
with that I finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> in record time I</font>

867
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:37,120
normally go over we have time for

868
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions and I thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">for questions so I'll bring the</font>

870
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:45,040
microphone<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to you if you have a</font>

871
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:47,050
question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recording hi thanks for</font>

872
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">your talk loved it you mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

873
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,980
there were some difficulties with doing

874
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,020
analytics on Jason and and presumably

875
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,610
other kinds of structured data and that

876
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:57,310
you were currently solving that by doing

877
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:59,440
just sort of like freeform text<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

878
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the excel stuff I was wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

879
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,630
could elaborate on like why is JSON

880
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:10,779
tricky no notnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> json tricky per se</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

881
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,700
think it's for classification for a

882
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,370
sensitive data discovery it's tricky

883
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,919
that was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point because you</font>

884
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:20,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to use text analytics to look for</font>

885
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,930
the you know the names of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the elements</font>

886
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,730
and then the values and you know see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

887
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,950
they're tied together and that's a

888
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit harder than just you know</font>

889
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing a regex expression and</font>

890
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:32,290
finding a string like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context</font>

891
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,960
around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really where the</font>

892
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge is analytics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know JSON is</font>

893
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,830
the de facto data interchange format I

894
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,840
mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what everyone is using and</font>

895
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,660
you know we think we've done a pretty

896
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,030
good job of that our tools over the last

897
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,490
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years have matured hugely you know</font>

898
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,320
like leaps and bounds and it's a lot

899
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:52,419
easier to even do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

900
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:59,350
now than before so sorry I needed to

901
00:35:52,420 --> 00:36:01,240
clarify that good question when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

902
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,700
mixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets you're loading them into</font>

903
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,379
the platform when there's multiple class

904
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,270
classification levels it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

905
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,090
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and non sensitive data</font>

906
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:13,180
have you seen methods where you're

907
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:16,390
tagging that data on the way in work or

908
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,890
are you seeing more isolation we're

909
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,990
actually pushing the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> into separate</font>

910
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,850
infrastructure zones or you're

911
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,709
classifying sensitive data away from

912
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,440
maybe less sensitive data so you can

913
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,160
actually kind

914
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,589
detect where you might need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

915
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,129
additional controls that's such a great

916
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:33,779
question so to rephrase it have you seen

917
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,849
one of which of the two approaches have

918
00:36:33,779 --> 00:36:37,859
you seen where you yeah we're that you

919
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:40,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">tagged the data that it comes in up</font>

920
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:42,630
front or you put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> different places</font>

921
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,430
i would say more putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in different</font>

922
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">places right now because the tagging is</font>

923
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,359
still maturing and you know there's some

924
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,750
interesting things going on in that area

925
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">i I believe my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me my my perspective is</font>

926
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,609
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be tagging all data</font>

927
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,529
automatically and then we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

928
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:00,779
these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we would know you</font>

929
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:03,180
know as data flows we go what that's

930
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:04,920
read data you know be careful watch that

931
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,180
one right I mean if we had done that

932
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,339
from the very beginning we wouldn't be

933
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,200
in this mess right now where we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

934
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,910
spend I have clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally who think</font>

935
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a good idea to classify all their</font>

936
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,960
data and take five years to do it before

937
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">they even do anything to protect it the</font>

938
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,579
one of them is a major automaker and

939
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,589
believe me it just it drives me not so

940
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,289
that it's a very good question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say</font>

941
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:27,240
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space it is still maturing</font>

942
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:28,920
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely something that I'm doing</font>

943
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:37,140
a bit of work on with our analytics team

944
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:38,369
right now so yeah we're still some time

945
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,529
for questions about seven minutes

946
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,240
anybody else or even feedback you know

947
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:45,690
I'd love to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your all-seeing</font>

948
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:53,640
and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and you know what</font>

949
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:55,799
are the trends that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're observing and</font>

950
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,170
one more um do you run to elasticsearch

951
00:37:55,799 --> 00:38:01,109
at all it's becoming kind of hot in me a

952
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,140
security space somewhat not much you

953
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:06,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but no not</font>

954
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,319
really

955
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:15,660
alright well thank you cindy great thank

956
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,660
you everyone
