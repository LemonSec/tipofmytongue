00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,610
cloud this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next evolution</font>

6
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:18,110
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly just</font>

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,460
to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what WT is if you don't know</font>

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,529
history and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about what</font>

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,810
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in sort of the next gen of wte</font>

11
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,300
my background so I started out life

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,919
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an economics major and</font>

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,539
realized people would pay me to fart

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,210
around a computer so switched over and

15
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,670
got a master's in mis started out life

16
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,440
as a developer have been a DBA assisted

17
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,679
in a pen tester and now I'm just a

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,539
general security guy and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been along</font>

19
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:46,280
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a long history of linux and</font>

20
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:48,079
open source i think in two thousand was

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,699
the last time i had an actual box with

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,489
windows and since then it's been linux

23
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,958
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've had 11 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Linux somewhat</font>

24
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,888
biased towards that which made the live

25
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:59,359
CD<font color="#CCCCCC"> Projekt rather good for me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on</font>

26
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:01,809
the board and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfun employed until</font>

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">October first and then I'll be a track</font>

28
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,850
so quick history it all started one fine

29
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,980
spring day when I was reading my email

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,289
and this email came in about the Summer

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,970
of Code 2008 and it said hey we want to

32
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,970
do this live CD thing and I thought well

33
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,100
suit sweet I like app sec I like Linux

34
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,450
this is both of them you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

35
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,070
your chocolate in my peanut butter and

36
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,670
your peanut butter<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my chocolate right</font>

37
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,410
this is perfect so I applied and later

38
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,940
that summer I finished are actually

39
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,979
later that fall September I finished the

40
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,750
first release of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the live CD and it was</font>

41
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,790
strictly an ISO image that you could

42
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,670
boot that was it with a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

43
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,430
remember how many tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1015 tools since</font>

44
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,450
then I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a few more releases right</font>

45
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:49,580
2 108 2 and of 91 and 10 and now to this

46
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,620
year and starting after appt<font color="#CCCCCC"> seki you</font>

47
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,780
know actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did it for the absa cue</font>

48
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,909
release as well not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I produce</font>

49
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,490
an ISO image but I started making VMware

50
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,560
and virtualbox images because as i was

51
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,600
using this I so I realized one it's a

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,190
pain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep updated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if there's</font>

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,710
a new tool after Jenna whole new I so

54
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,780
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is annoying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then number two I</font>

55
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,780
wanted persistence if I'm doing putting

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,120
data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,130
to stay if I make a vm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data stays</font>

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,569
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can pause it I can go get coffee</font>

59
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,790
and come back and can fire it back up

60
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and keep working right and this is what</font>

61
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,840
I use when I do web app tests day in<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,880
out I create one for a client I do the

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,510
testing when I'm done I toss it away the

64
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,950
client data goes away no problems last

65
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,040
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I counted downloads which was a</font>

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,450
long time ago November of 10 there were

67
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,220
three hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thirty thousand</font>

68
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,500
downloads of various versions of the

69
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">live CD since I launched it the poor</font>

70
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts that i'm using who gave me</font>

71
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,190
unlimited bandwidth and storage for 250

72
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,310
for five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've already used five</font>

73
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,750
terabytes of their bandwidth I think

74
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,280
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being nice to me they can't not</font>

75
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,110
have noticed because I've got to be that

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,080
one weird blip on the chart that's way

77
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,060
off the radar and I had 86<font color="#CCCCCC"> air 81,000</font>

78
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,400
download in one month that was a motel

79
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,110
most downloads I've ever had this was

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,910
like a honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I did kind of</font>

81
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,410
on a whim over the summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

82
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,620
thought it'd be cool and it just went

83
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,030
nuts so when I decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,739
what this isoh thing and the live CD

85
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing wasn't going to working i renamed</font>

86
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,590
it i said i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it the web</font>

87
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,540
testing environment because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing</font>

88
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,610
more than live<font color="#CCCCCC"> cds i'm doing is i'm</font>

89
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,920
doing VMS and now I'm packaging

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,630
individual tools so now it's sort of

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this ala carte what do you want and we</font>

92
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,090
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create it because I've abstracted</font>

93
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,620
out all the pieces I've said<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font>

94
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,860
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now VMware installs virtual boss</font>

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,360
installs i created a USB install on an

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,530
earlier version but honestly it was so

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,790
slow you wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it i</font>

98
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,950
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my enemies let alone</font>

99
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,298
my friends I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> used it for many</font>

100
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,660
training environments and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

101
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,030
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud and starting with</font>

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wte release</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I moved over to debian</font>

103
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,670
or boom two packages and if you take the

104
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:53,100
the tools I've done and the 26,000

105
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,640
packages<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debian like what</font>

106
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,079
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want right I was doing a class</font>

107
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,179
yesterday and I was showing an example

108
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> C surf and I needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick HTML</font>

109
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,750
editor i installed bluefish because you

110
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,940
just apt-get install bluefish there's an

111
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:10,019
HTML editor I can show<font color="#CCCCCC"> them a demo right</font>

112
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,459
BAM it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite nice and then the</font>

113
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,799
goal right the goal here was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

114
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,450
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools and documentation cake</font>

115
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,370
easy because there's a there's not

116
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,719
enough people doing security as it is so

117
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,720
I want the barrier to entry to be

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,100
ridiculously low

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,950
and this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a compliment 200 so</font>

120
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,050
let's make security visible goal the

121
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,000
other thing besides being easy for users

122
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,400
to use I want it easy to be updated

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,260
particularly in the vm versions right

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
apt-get update and you pull the new

125
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,230
tools so if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> older release of</font>

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,750
it in a vm right now you can do

127
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,610
applicant update and pull updates zap

128
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,090
and the other tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have read since</font>

129
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,200
I pushed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last really sound and</font>

130
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,359
selfishly I want an easy for me to

131
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,770
update it and I've automated almost all

132
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,110
of this now I actually have it to where

133
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,549
I have a script to export out of the

134
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,890
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> code repository and another one</font>

135
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,860
to build so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go to the source</font>

136
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,510
code update the package run<font color="#CCCCCC"> to commands</font>

137
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i have a new debian package which is</font>

138
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,330
lovely and just to note this is focused

139
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,950
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that application testing this is</font>

140
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,050
not sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a competitor for back</font>

141
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,180
tracker to try to do general network<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen</font>

142
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,590
testing that's not my bailiwick I don't

143
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,010
care to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them back track is</font>

144
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,349
fantastic for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network been testing so</font>

145
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,170
quickly what's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> wte well here's what</font>

146
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,670
it looks like when you boot it up well

147
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,730
not the unity version of it going to put

148
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,920
a standard of boom<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and I create an</font>

149
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,170
OAuth directory that in which I put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

150
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,370
the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i have and i put sub</font>

151
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,690
directories for tools so they're

152
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,000
categorized right so if you're new to

153
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">apps i can you don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">what Jay bro fuzz order buster is I'll</font>

155
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,330
throw it in a fuzzer directory so you

156
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,650
have an idea and as an aside all of the

157
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,680
packages are created that if you

158
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,810
installed just let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> jboro fuzz on</font>

159
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
your boon to system it will create an<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS</font>

160
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,110
directory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the fuzzer directory</font>

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> j bro phones will be in there so it</font>

162
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamically increases in shrinks that</font>

163
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,750
menuing system automatically for you or

164
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,890
lots of bash and there's 29 what i would

165
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,280
call significant tools that I've

166
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:08,570
packaged these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP tools</font>

167
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,669
and these are the natto<font color="#CCCCCC"> los tools and</font>

168
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,180
then why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it different well things</font>

169
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:18,060
like the browser comes with 20 some-odd

170
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:21,030
add-ons pre-configured any proxy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

171
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,890
have on wte already has a foxy proxy

172
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,539
entry right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just load this</font>

173
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,669
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there's no like filling</font>

174
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,100
around with what's the 8080 is for zap

175
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,969
and burp is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8088</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or it's all</font>

176
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,249
pre-configured

177
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,889
I have a ridiculous number i think it's

178
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:36,389
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 70 some-odd user agents so if you</font>

179
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,839
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an iphone 3 you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

180
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,369
iphone 3 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a ridiculous amount</font>

181
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,039
of documentation in there pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

182
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:47,699
any guide worth its salt or any

documentation project from<font color="#E5E5E5"> olas plus the</font>

185
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">wte ah i also have a debian repo so if</font>

186
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,779
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a debian person you just want to</font>

187
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">point at my repo and pull the package or</font>

188
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,860
to go to town and i also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a testing</font>

189
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,499
repo for those things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't quite</font>

190
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready for prime time or in well sequel I</font>

191
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:11,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">excess and really off awful dependencies</font>

192
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,899
that I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work around</font>

193
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,829
so it's living and testing till I get it

194
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:18,209
working right you can use the aptitude

195
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:20,219
if you want to pull in packages one by

196
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,749
one you can use you a boon to software

197
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:25,289
center right I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

198
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:28,079
like ridiculously easy i have a google

199
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,089
code site where all of the code is up do

200
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,309
you want to see the bin script that

201
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,929
fires up web<font color="#E5E5E5"> scarab it's right there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

202
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,449
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I've try to make this</font>

203
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:37,859
it's open and easy as possible and in

204
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,119
fact I mean I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it to</font>

205
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,800
where if I could hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a bus somebody</font>

206
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:42,389
could pick this up and go even the

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,649
scripts i use to auto build those things

208
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:48,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am getting feedback yeah even the</font>

209
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:50,939
scripts i use to build that the build an

210
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:54,749
export out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> svn are checked into svn</font>

211
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:58,019
so it's all there so what's next right

212
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:59,579
let's stick a wasp in the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

213
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I've got the ISO thing pretty</font>

214
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,039
well figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got the vm figured</font>

215
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,749
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough but it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really cool</font>

216
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,759
if i could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like dynamically fire up</font>

217
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:07,259
a thing in the sky right and have my

218
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,699
testing tools and there wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could</font>

219
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,429
test it when I'm done you kick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

220
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,319
right so let's see if that's possible

221
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:16,318
well so how do you cloud if I because we

222
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,279
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make more words wte right well</font>

223
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,049
you get it you pick a cloud provider

224
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,929
you're doing a boon tour a debian

225
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:27,508
install you add the WT repository and

226
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:29,818
then fun ensues right so coincidentally

227
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,300
I force this into a stall 12-step

228
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:35,099
program right currently all this is

229
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,539
manuel i would have I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

230
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,979
more time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have more time</font>

231
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,448
to automate this that's the

232
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,039
next thing for me next week because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

233
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:44,969
in between jobs now and I have next week

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,740
off so I will do that next week<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

235
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,870
took about 30 minutes most of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

236
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,959
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for the packages it takes to</font>

237
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,899
take a debian or a boon<font color="#CCCCCC"> to server into</font>

238
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,849
anna debian ubuntu desktop right so if

239
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,320
you need a depth full desktop that's a

240
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,459
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packages that could pull down</font>

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,769
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you a UI so</font>

242
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,079
go get a cloud account I used Rackspace

243
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,310
in this in this case because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

244
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:14,310
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be quite honest with</font>

245
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I picked a boon to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1010 I chose some</font>

246
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,518
ram<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chose to gig which is actually</font>

247
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,560
twice what I read it when i run it in a

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">vm but it's silly cheap so why not i</font>

249
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,920
started the server which generates an

250
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:32,070
email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of like here's your IP is sh</font>

251
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,139
din I apt-get install<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boon to desktops</font>

252
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,449
and unfortunately one of my packages had

253
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,339
a dependency problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to list</font>

254
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:41,910
out all but that one instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

255
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing apt-get install a wasps WT star</font>

256
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,050
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how i like to do those installs</font>

257
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,329
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm lazy so unfortunately listen</font>

258
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,769
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packages but you do this thing</font>

259
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,910
this is the thing that takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

260
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,589
minutes because it's got to pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a</font>

261
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,740
ridiculous amount of packages to get all

262
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,959
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nome there you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add the</font>

263
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,660
partners repo because some of the tools

264
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,760
demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> sons JVM as well as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wte repo I</font>

265
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,490
added NX server are very familiar with

266
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,130
NX server it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically Windows</font>

267
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,050
desktop right for the linux platform so

268
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get an optimized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x connection</font>

269
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,029
between you and it there's a PPA for the

270
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,290
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> you next team and there's a minor</font>

271
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:21,329
fix you have to do to make that work

272
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's another little pain point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

273
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,709
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> later i added a no asti user</font>

274
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">i fired up gdm from there i fire up a NX</font>

275

client<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put in the IP address i tell it</font>

276
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:38,100
it's running gnome and give it a display

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,819
really fun and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get banned or</font>

281
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,010
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better like you're on the the</font>

282
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,690
kickoff call I'll just do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

283
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kickoff call by the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kickoff</font>

284
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,740
calls done you've got your environment

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,079
right no problems let's test

286
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,480
connectivity so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wikipedia i</font>

287
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,440
put in cats let's test the tools i

288
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,000
captured cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> i change cats to dogs all</font>

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I'm intercepting in a proxy in</font>

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,860
the sky<font color="#CCCCCC"> over cross the hotel crappy</font>

291
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,960
network and setting this thing up and

292
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,640
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that test cost me twenty three</font>

293
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:22,070
sets it's ridiculously cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a</font>

294
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">little math all right if you do a Linux</font>

295
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,130
system with 24 date you run it for 40

296
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:29,839
hours five bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do that for</font>

297
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,310
monday through friday for 24 hours a day

298
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,050
and you assume a gigabit of bandwidth

299
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,859
which is ridiculously high for web

300
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,750
testing you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 48 if you</font>

301
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,520
do this for 30 days for 24 hours and

302
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,140
four gig which is also a ridiculous

303
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,290
amount of bandwidth it's a gig a week

304
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,699
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's eighty eight bucks so I</font>

305
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,160
mean you can get a testing platform up

306
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,850
for nothing and quickly which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

307
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,089
sweet so now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I manually did it</font>

308
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,710
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> next well I want to create a WT</font>

309
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:59,240
cloud package to automate some of this

310
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,470
manual junk because that was annoying

311
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,839
but I had to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what had to</font>

312
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,890
happen so that's done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can pick out</font>

313
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,839
the one tool this problematic I want to

314
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the configurations steps into a</font>

315
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,470
script and include that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either as a post</font>

316
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,150
install or pre-install as part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

317
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,740
package so this is all just gets done

318
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:19,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> install deputy cloud magic happens</font>

319
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,500
and then like I said I want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

320
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,140
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> step right just install that one</font>

321
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,550
package<font color="#CCCCCC"> in BAM it'll depend on a boon to</font>

322
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,990
desktop and that will bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all those</font>

323
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">GUI environments and bam the other thing</font>

324
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to do and I didn't get time</font>

325
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,130
before this conference is right in lib

326
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,410
cloud a script to launch these things

327
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,779
lib cloud is a python library<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

328
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,600
tracks out differences in api's for

329
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,610
cloud providers so if you have a amazon

330
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,430
key or a rackspace key or who knows what

331
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:52,470
key slicehost or I think bracket rack

332
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">BOTS license right yeah so never mind</font>

333
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,400
somebody else right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pick your</font>

334
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,500
cloud provider there's 24 different

335
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,660
cloud providers that this supports so

336
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,890
you can even price shop now you just

337
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,310
need an API key and my script<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bam so</font>

338
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:13,140
you can go give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wte on amazon and it</font>

339
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,219
happens which will be beautiful the

340
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,540
other thing that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to</font>

341
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,790
play around with this there's different

342
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,709
variations on the desktop installs I did

343
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,079
the full monty<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ubuntu desktop and that's</font>

344
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,510
the everything you can do a minimal or

345
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,210
baseline minimal being smaller than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

346
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,500
baseline one and bring that 28<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

347
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,210
or so it took to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those</font>

348
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,260
packages hopefully down to 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> or so</font>

349
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:36,270
right one of the cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

350
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,350
this you can throw the web goat in the

351
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sky right you're going to do some</font>

352
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,860
training internally you don't have to

353
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,270
set up zillion web<font color="#CCCCCC"> code servers and</font>

354
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,950
right now web go doesn't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

355
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,400
difference of users right you need one

356
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,560
per user<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fire up I mean 23 cents</font>

357
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,620
come on fire up<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things give</font>

358
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,119
everybody an NX client oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the way</font>

359
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,490
NX clients run on windows mac and linux

360
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,880
so the platform that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using to</font>

361
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,260
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> w/e doesn't matter and then if</font>

362
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,820
you have internal clouds right you can

363
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,770
run OpenStack internally if you have a

364
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMware infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

365
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,850
VirtualBox headless all of those things

366
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,140
now could be supported by w<font color="#E5E5E5"> touhy so</font>

367
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,940
it's like how and when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

368
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:17,250
test right ah talking the document

369
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,950
document right so next week when I'm not

370
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,440
working I'm going to document and post

371
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,380
the current manual process so if you

372
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,360
want to unfortunately after next week go

373
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,130
do this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself the process will be</font>

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,920
there you can follow the steps and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

375
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,810
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> work no problems the next thing</font>

376
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,910
after that is to create and document how

377
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,010
the lib<font color="#E5E5E5"> club process will work it should</font>

378
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:42,780
be fairly simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

379
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:45,210
driving me nuts anyway it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

380
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,160
fairly straightforward process and then

381
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,720
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to write tutorials for various</font>

382
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,660
providers I've only tested this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> rack</font>

383
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,660
so far and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is awful</font>

384
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,880
keep talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up close okay let's just</font>

385
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving me nuts I want to write</font>

386
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,699
tutorials for the various providers at

387
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,810
least for amazon and rackspace the two

388
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:09,560
biggies right so that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were you</font>

389
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,268
know if you already have an existing

390
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,300
amazon keen you want to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

391
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,320
fine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have used Rackspace fine</font>

392
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sony</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to document this stuff</font>

393
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,959
unfortunately a little bit thin but it

394
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,760
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay problems so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

395
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,018
started to do this POC and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

396
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">see what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen well I had a few</font>

397
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,860
problems right all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my stuff has been</font>

398
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,449
for i386 because that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

399
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,480
universal thing to do particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

400
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,849
VMS well rach gave me an AMD 64 cpu

401
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,060
which is really cool except for like the

402
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">firefox i have is for i386 and one of</font>

403
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,209
the dependencies for sequel map doesn't

404
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,639
exist on 64-bit so yeah and getting a

405
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,689
64-bit and x server was a bit tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

406
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,149
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to end up</font>

407
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,639
having to make my own 64-bit NX package

408
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,860
and just push it into my repo guys don't

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,279
it was it's workable now but it's not

410
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,170
perfect and just annoyingly right it

411
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,180
doesn't look as pretty the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wte theme</font>

412
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,979
gets lost right when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that update</font>

413
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,260
you get the default guntur default

414
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,769
debian<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to</font>

415
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:12,019
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the theme automagically applied</font>

416
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,889
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> selfishly and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it looks cool</font>

417
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:18,050
so you know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so how can you get</font>

418
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,670
