1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:09,749
so welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our pact talk on great man</font>

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:17,340
Jenkins we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about</font>

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:19,110
static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ruby on rails so I'm</font>

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,790
Justin Collins if you search the

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,090
internet for president beef you'll find

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,060
me on many many sites so if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the talk this morning all my information</font>

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,880
is out there including musical taste

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,120
smell and privileged enough to walk with

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,280
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it would end we look at an</font>

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
eight-minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> Durrington and haughtiness</font>

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
also a couple of how many years but now

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I became a security the security</font>

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:54,289
architect I just three years so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,859
one approach to do we handle security

16
00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:00,989
pedestals literally so awful safavieh

17
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,079
isn't my client right we want to use

18
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,509
tools to detect the security defects

19
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:10,798
early in the face and we want to do that

20
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">without an alarm impact on me mm work</font>

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">for because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we all know that</font>

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,798
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them easy there or featuring</font>

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,899
quite specialist feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and</font>

24
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,759
their deadlines rights are we going to

25
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:22,950
go tell their liking a hater do this

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,979
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you run this to</font>

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,770
analyze your results most likely they

28
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,170
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on each other</font>

29
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,649
I'll do it later so the approach that we

30
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,810
took was that you know we here at home

31
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">get we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out one is too long here and</font>

32
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,369
you ain't even know it so if I wouldn't

33
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,200
either tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what were the QA</font>

34
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,710
automation be honest we build this

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,390
system we start up this are continuously

36
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,908
integrate this with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the continuous</font>

37
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,649
integration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their results</font>

38
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just presented to the money the</font>

39
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,259
net result right so that's a present<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,899
something behind this bike up and touch

41
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,610
point comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> gary greg rolls and</font>

42
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,950
chicken touch points in the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

43
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,470
security component life cycle so you

44
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,390
know what I started her started doing is

45
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,788
a security reviews and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

46
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:16,010
junior work backwards into an

47
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:17,720
architecture security requirement but

48
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,870
the code review he has come along right

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,359
hand it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to do because how</font>

50
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> news he admitted that you know we</font>

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have good tools or writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,160
scary moving for those applications so

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,768
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do this well you know</font>

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,930
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a different costcutter we have</font>

55
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,780
seen in this original local started by

56
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,500
very game USC and this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,069
is by that's gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically the</font>

58
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,040
cost goes up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost of fixing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defects</font>

59
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:51,560
goes up as yoga later go later in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">cycle so what we usually have been doing</font>

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,599
this application security testing or

62
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:58,280
penetration testing negative state so we

63
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,530
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this all the way down to like</font>

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,079
very beginning so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a hard</font>

65
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:07,760
protocol to our community so what about

66
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,010
static analysis and

67
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,269
all the penetration testing me we all

68
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,030
know this penetration testing you

69
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:19,400
actually a replicates<font color="#E5E5E5"> behem coverage an</font>

to enjoy it curious icon which is pie

plate and you gather in complete review

77
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,489
of the money map and study analysis you

78
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,988
know you can do it in an early other

79
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,879
faces at the moment as you're writing

80

code in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking in code and you</font>

get integrate this into the double full

82
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,328
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd only duty for anything because</font>

83
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:56,810
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was with your source code and the</font>

84
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:58,909
typical tropics our study analysis you

85
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,590
need access to the source code you know

86
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:02,870
you're limited to be a view is limited

87
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,150
to the curve not yet and I application

88
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,790
stick and they moving bullet protest

89
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,650
have gone you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing very</font>

90
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,650
annoying that's a false positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

91
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,650
again to how we address false positives

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,048
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bridge so these are the tubes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

93
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know there are tools for cc possible</font>

94
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will mention names but is it was</font>

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,669
java and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some tools for</font>

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,639
doing studying analysis but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font>

100
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,549
particularly for security because you're

101
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,650
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

102
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">credit language and garbage collector</font>

103
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,450
language account here I've always you

104
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,490
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> here are the issues and then Ruby</font>

105
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:54,289
on Rails there was basically no tools no

106
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,030
usable Friday go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fighting huh</font>

107
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,610
security defects and a ruby on rails

108
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:11,729
code at desk<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're pregnant housing and</font>

109
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:15,780
that's good testing concert so so so if

110
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,840
you're using a tool like break man this

111
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,849
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the workflow you get the</font>

112
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,530
latest code and then you run the tool

113
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you look at the results and</font>

114
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,900
then you cry tell somebody about them

115
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,580
but then when the code changes you do it

116
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:34,049
again you do it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over</font>

117
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,120
again so and I this is what happened to

118
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,490
you basically i wrote the toll and then

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh run it on the code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

120
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,270
code of change now I have to run again

121
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,630
so of course what we'd really like to do

122
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,900
is we'll just relax and we'll right

123
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:56,760
tools that will tell us when there's a

124
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:59,969
home so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of article so great</font>

125
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">man is the static analysis tool that we</font>

126
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:07,590
have that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website it's free and</font>

127
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,840
open source so<font color="#E5E5E5"> download it so how many</font>

128
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you are ruby on rails developers</font>

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and how many of you</font>

130
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:22,729
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with Ruby on Rails yeah</font>

131
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,589
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the main thing</font>

132
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,900
if you were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write a sack now</font>

133
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:29,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Siskel for Ruby you'd be like oh man</font>

134
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,888
where do I even start and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on</font>

135
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,068
the internet there's there a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

136
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,479
who made some progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area but</font>

137
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,879
it's like oh and you can almost do

138
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,258
anything so probably know where to start

139
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,110
well the nice thing is with ruby on

140
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:46,610
rails because they have a very

141
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,589
structured approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i should</font>

142
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,830
say Ruby on Rails is the lip a web

143
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,569
framework that runs on your being but

144
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,949
because they have this idea of like well

145
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,409
if you just put things in the normal

146
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,300
places then everything works on defaults

147
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:02,419
so that makes it easy if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font>

148
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,749
a tool to analyze the programs because

149
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:07,909
you can you know well the default view

150
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:10,759
for this will be in this file directory

151
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:13,240
in Ohio made this so it's very easy

152
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">flank so that gives us extra advantage</font>

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:22,370
when we're doing static analysis so the

154
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,909
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> great man works is first corsa</font>

155
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,800
parses the code it does some clean up

156
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:32,300
some simplification of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract</font>

157
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,789
syntax tree and then it was at the

158
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:40,610
results of that runs multiple checks on

159
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:42,649
it and then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generator report so here's</font>

160
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,509
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the owner abilities</font>

161
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:45,680
it detects all the standard basically

162
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,830
the standard ones cross-site scripting

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,309
sequel injection and objection redirects

164
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,169
final access basically most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

165
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:57,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font>

166
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">tabatha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I should point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out that</font>

167
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Alice all<font color="#E5E5E5"> new movies come out like in</font>

168
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,090
specific versions we add those in so it

169
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,620
knows if you're running the specific

170
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,150
version will save up a boat for this

171
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,520
version if there's the security problem

172
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:18,500
so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a template</font>

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:21,650
using ERV the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default template here</font>

174
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:25,580
we're saying pleased with this query

175
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,950
parameter into the page so forward rails

176
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">two point oh this would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a cross-site</font>

177
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:36,470
scripting vulnerability in rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> three a</font>

178
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">discreet by default so in rails three</font>

179
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,950
you would actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a little</font>

180
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Morgan say dumb please output</font>

181
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:46,010
this without<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's evening so if you</font>

182
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,410
were to run break man against code like

183
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,080
this you get a warning like this so

184
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,969
escape parameter value<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets line number</font>

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:09:01,490
and then you get the code as great man

186
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:05,810
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight so another example so</font>

187
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,360
here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a database query and</font>

188
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:13,339
we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to drop a variable</font>

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,870
right in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically just have</font>

190
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">a local variable we're assigning to</font>

191
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,840
create grammar to it and dropping into

192
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:24,920
our sequel statement so we know this is

193
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:30,470
wrong right the rails<font color="#CCCCCC"> developer to raise</font>

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:33,589
your hands make<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so you should be</font>

195
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a parameter is great so great man</font>

196
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,240
notices this you'll get a warning like

197
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,670
this and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the</font>

198
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,710
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of the variable</font>

199
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:50,990
what we report so here's a little bit

200
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,610
later example here we have a we're at

201
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application controller level so</font>

202
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the highest controller on</font>

203
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,520
the inheritance hierarchy we have a

204
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:05,300
method and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to set the</font>

205
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:10,939
variable to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> user that we get out of</font>

206
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:12,859
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database so then our user control</font>

207
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,800
like this is kind of a contrived example

208
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,400
but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut this filter where</font>

209
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,490
we call that on any action that we do so

210
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,490
we have action show and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will call</font>

211
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,750
the set user that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it</font>

212
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:34,790
actually does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> show Cheryl action so</font>

213
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,860
then we have our view and let's say we

214
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,980
like the user to be able to put some

215
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,990
HTML into their bio but we think we

216
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,100
stripped out everything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad so</font>

217
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:48,650
we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the basic</font>

218
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,300
flow is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a user</font>

219
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,579
controller then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

220
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the application roller call that filter</font>

221
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,730
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

222
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,270
controller and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down to</font>

223
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual view and that's where we're</font>

224
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,640
going to catch the air so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

225
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,440
warning something like this so here you

226
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,819
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual value that we</font>

227
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,549
put in

228
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:12,759
to that user variable so if you were

229
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just looking through your views or if</font>

230
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,079
you were using a tool that lets say uses

231
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,169
regular expressions to look for problems

232
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,878
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to find this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Lord</font>

233
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:27,369
and you probably you may or may not

234
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:32,229
notice what's going on k so one more

235
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:36,369
example this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a model as generated by</font>

236
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:40,410
rails so there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it because</font>

237
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:40,410
it it pulls everything from the database

238
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,660
here is the corresponding controller

239
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:51,489
that it generates and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

240
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,679
it's creating a new user straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

241
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:57,819
query cache so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

242
00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:00,488
familiar with an ass assignment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

243
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:08,769
tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you are familiar with the</font>

244
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:11,319
issue that discusses yeah okay yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

245
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:13,689
this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically take the all the</font>

246
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,459
parameter values that you're passing in

247
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:17,949
and it will put those directly into the

248
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:21,429
database so if you're not restricting

249
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:23,498
anything will show an example later if

250
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:26,679
admin is one of your attributes that

251
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:30,220
people can just add<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into the great</font>

252
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:34,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">rounders I'm in true or one and now</font>

253
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,799
their admins so assuming that you're not

254
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:41,019
restricting<font color="#E5E5E5"> access you will get a</font>

255
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:43,709
warning this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so so now we've</font>

256
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,709
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> folded</font>

257
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,720
if you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you use attribute</font>

258
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,800
accessible and you will not get this

259
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:59,110
morning if you disabled mass assignment

260
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suck it so now we have the tool</font>

261
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,700
that's giving us the warnings but we're

262
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,270
still running it manually so that's

263
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:11,140
where Jenkins comes in or<font color="#CCCCCC"> formally</font>

264
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hudson which is an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

265
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,990
continuous indication surgery and

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:23,199
basically it's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you use</font>

267
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:24,850
Hudson urging pins<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the thing the</font>

268
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
reason the slide is so generic is

269
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,560
because you can almost do anything with

270
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,500
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general you're going to</font>

271
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:37,420
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> some conditions in our case you</font>

272
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,010
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> source code repository what certain</font>

273
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,979
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen someone chasing some code</font>

274
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:44,290
will run some jobs against it and then

275
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll report some results so in our case</font>

276
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,339
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay someone put some code</font>

277
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,370
we're going to run great man and then

278
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:54,640
we're going to return some results so we

279
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,200
actually have a plug-in that integrates

280
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,110
with another<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in to give you these</font>

281
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,360
nice scraps and it basically works like

282
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,820
I said so it will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> break man against</font>

283
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code it'll grab all the warnings and</font>

284
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:11,170
you'll get these nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> crops out of it so</font>

285

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,180
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> rails application you run break</font>

295
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,790
then course there's a lot of other

just want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try it out this is all it</font>

298
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:51,439
takes to run it and we have some

299
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:54,740
resources which can find later with you

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk and is going</font>

303
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tighten so the first thing we're</font>

304
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:27,850
going to do is create a new rails

305
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:30,040
application this is using rails<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

306
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:36,089
something three-point oh my something

307
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,089
like that so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just want brakemen</font>

308
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:43,300
see it notices its rails 3 and this is a

309
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,759
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the output</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go kid and you'll see</font>

310
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,279
if and find anything is this was a

311
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,749
realistic you map location you would get

312
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,430
at least one warning which would be the

313
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:56,829
default were held this morning but they

314
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:58,540
disabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in rows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 so we did so now</font>

315
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:04,239
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a git</font>

316
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:07,629
repo so we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with Jenkins so</font>

317
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,620
we've initialized it added all the files

318
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,620
and do a commit

319
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:25,949
alright so now if we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Jenkins or as</font>

320
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:28,380
soon as this is labeled we're going to

321
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new job this is like sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

322
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:37,070
like this repair minimum set up to do so

323
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,069
freestyle software project

324
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:50,089
it's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> both boy that's why it's</font>

325
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,509
kind of slow also<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> java that's also</font>

326
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive</font>

327
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,589
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're going to point it to</font>

328
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:09,970
scroll<font color="#CCCCCC"> down it normally went with this</font>

329
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,699
you know squish together is just so you

330
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,750
guys can see it so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in</font>

331
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:22,439
the file the path to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our repository did</font>

332
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,439
you write that down yes are the file

333
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,490
upset

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:46,790
and go down no just just like that so

335
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:50,180
the plug-in itself will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a break</font>

336
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,860
man for you because there's too many

337
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,870
different ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a great</font>

338
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:57,800
man<font color="#E5E5E5"> and salt ending on your groovy set</font>

339
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:01,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">up so all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have so this is like the</font>

340
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,919
simplest case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruby just kind</font>

341
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:07,790
of installed default way in the gyms and

342
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:12,920
soul if you go to add build step and an

343
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:17,210
execute show and then you can just run

344
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:21,520
break man and the output is sort of a

345
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:31,000
special format just for this is Logan

346
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:36,080
show great man dash output doc<font color="#CCCCCC"> talents</font>

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,380
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talents extension is like to get</font>

348
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:44,000
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen tap eliminate output that's it</font>

349
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:45,260
so then we go down and there once you

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,350
install the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in there will be this</font>

351
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">publish break man mornings option and</font>

352
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the default file is what we</font>

353
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,960
put in just coincidentally and that's

354
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:02,090
all we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and save it so kind of</font>

355
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,880
the where the tricky part comes in is if

356
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,980
you so jinkins is usually installed on

357
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,420
the server somewhere and then sometimes

358
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,530
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> job so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to build them</font>

359
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,880
sometimes the jobs are going on like

360
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:19,520
slave machines so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tricky</font>

361
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,090
part is just getting great man<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run in</font>

362
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

363
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,629
she'll strip

364
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:35,519
so if you go if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you refresh the page</font>

365
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:52,530
so yes and we had to build time but no

366
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:56,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll see the graph later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back to</font>

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:35,880
we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user name password</font>

375
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:37,500
and then just for fun an admin flag for

the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a recommended way or</font>

384
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,110
kind of thing it's part of the job when

385
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:17,200
you set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but we found out when</font>

386
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,199
doing demos<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

387
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,769
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing that so will manually go</font>

388
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,769
back and

389
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,760
you know

391
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:08,480
actually will keep a local copy of your

392
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,750
code so when you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you change code it</font>

393
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:15,529
will actually it would you like you know

394
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,840
an svn update or<font color="#CCCCCC"> get pole so your own</font>

395

important changes so now you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

396
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:29,750
have 3d warnings yeah so we get this

397
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:32,768
kind of again it will look better<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

398
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,590
it's not on a huge screen so you can see

00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:42,740
there's warnings about these files<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

confidence mornings so you guys see that

426
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:33,450
so you can see command injection we

427
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:36,730
detected<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're bowing parameters a</font>

430
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:47,860
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little code snippet that's showing</font>

431
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,999
you where you know little<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of code</font>

432
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,619
this is where the warning came from any

433
00:24:51,999 --> 00:25:00,149
particular warnings that you guys went

434
00:24:53,619 --> 00:25:07,240
to be interested in cross-site scripting

435
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:09,279
ok so the scroll down the warnings

436
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,950

437
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:17,980
see ya we aren't protecting against

438
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:20,200
cross-site request forgery little bit

439
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,450
lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so now we're into the</font>

440
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,020
cross-site scripting these are warnings

441
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,080
generated from you

442
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:34,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and see so here we're putting these</font>

443
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:39,110
cookies you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the one right above</font>

444
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so here you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example</font>

445
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,969
where the parameters are actually coming

446
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,290
in from a variable from the nose we're

447
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:50,000
probably controller so what you see from

448
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,210
great man is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're outputting</font>

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,090
cramps on safe what you see in the

450
00:25:53,210 --> 00:26:00,140
actual code is just some very literally

451
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:02,840
called some variable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

452
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,900
see right below it in the code it's

453
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,189
calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> escape once so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will not get</font>

454
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,100
a warning about that because great guy

455
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:17,570
knows that you're escaping the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

456
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:20,449
giving the user input anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else you</font>

457
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,320
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in yes does it look</font>

458
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,180
forward like so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default view stadium</font>

459
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,129
does Monsieur singing quote so if you

460
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:30,130
have like HTML attribute single

461
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,210
it doesn't escape oh right because it's

462
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">just HTML estate right yeah so this is</font>

463
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an attribute context with single</font>

464
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:52,970
quotes this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of market no we don't</font>

465
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:54,530
because it's not a break man wouldn't

466
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:01,309
actually know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're in that</font>

467
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:03,290
context but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you that's interesting</font>

468
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:08,860
yeah so that's something that possibly

469
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:08,860
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not leave any other your questions</font>

470
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:21,380
questions about how it works or things

471
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:23,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manning up I miss so there is well</font>

472
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously we use it internally but there</font>

473
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:31,010
is a program which I don't know exactly

474
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,740
if we forked it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> reopen source it or</font>

475
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,710
we open<font color="#E5E5E5"> sourced it is called inventory</font>

476
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:39,620
without in<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's like</font>

477
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:45,559
hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> models and hundreds of views</font>

478
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:49,129
and just it's huge and we thought it

479
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:54,620
against that science is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an</font>

480
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:58,010
issue unless you ran out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Graham it's</font>

481
00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to do it it's not going to</font>

482
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:05,000
look in stuff that is sort of outside of

483
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the usual rails back so it's it doesn't</font>

484
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,799
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like external libraries or</font>

485
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:12,590
anything like that the main thing that

486
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:16,160
takes up time is it for every action

487
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:19,699
that will actually generate a new view

488
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,870
using the variables from action so

489
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:26,120
that's what takes up most

490
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:27,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">finding resources but so even against</font>

491
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,350
that with you know hundreds of bottles

492
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,000
and hundreds of views<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hundreds</font>

493
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,340
things I might agree hundreds of

494
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,320
controllers I'm not sure it takes a few

495
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,760
minutes to run so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still pretty</font>

496
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,100
quick and if you're doing it with

497
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:45,890
continuous integration I mean you won't

498
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:49,189
notice that it takes a few minutes any

499
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:53,300
other question game it will run under

500
00:28:49,190 --> 00:29:00,050
Avery yes it will also run under the

501
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:06,800
latest Rubinius and probably other

502
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:10,820
places around with 191 Queenie<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

503
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:14,000
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use 1.87 bit now it work of 1.86</font>

504
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">too because we had an application that</font>

505
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,890
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using her reading or crisis edition</font>

506
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,580
any other questions

507
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:31,070
so one thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check out</font>

508
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,940
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the resources</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide and it</font>

509
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,939
was turned into a

510
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:44,450
yeah so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned into a wasp</font>

511
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:47,389
project which is the real Ruby on Rails

512
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:51,589
security guy it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alphabeat it's</font>

513
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:54,619
basically for rails to but I've actually

514
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:57,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen it recommended places as a general</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good resource if talks about you</font>

521
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,429
know session hijacking and all sorts of

522
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:22,249
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things not just related to</font>
