1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,799
so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out today and just</font>

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:15,309
kind of go over because there is a lot

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">of new people here kind of what the what</font>

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,900
the enterprise security API is so I've

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,930
got this awesome like totally ridiculous

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,829
animated powerpoint slide that explains

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,829
it way better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,019
and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong one</font>

9
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:45,820
see just<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you think you're</font>

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:47,739
completely prepared so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what most</font>

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,070
web applications look like you've got

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,390
all these different layers you've got

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,530
all these controls and all these

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">different layers you've got your</font>

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication you've got your access</font>

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,260
control you've got encryption you've got

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,430
logging you've got validation you've got

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,809
output encoding you've got all these

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">things going on all over your</font>

20
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,149
application the problem is is I wrote

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,640
the validation routine for the

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,200
controller and Jason over here with the

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,780
validation routine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> validates the</font>

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,090
same data<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data access layer are we</font>

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing things the exact same way probably</font>

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,050
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz I'm a better developer than</font>

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:26,259
Jason that being said neither one is

28
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,970
necessarily absolutely wrong but in any

29
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,500
kind of enterprise application the key

30
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not who's right and who's wrong the</font>

31
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,960
key is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's standard the key is</font>

32
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's one routine so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,270
change the data that's being validated I

34
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,550
change it in one place not 47 same holds

35
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">true for any of these controls right so</font>

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,780
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your average everyday web</font>

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,159
application does what the isapi actually

38
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,540
is at its core this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a library that</font>

39
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,030
turns your web application into

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,229
something looks a little more manageable

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,130
so now you've got this new layer out

42
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,590
there and that's your enterprise

43
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,850
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> API in your enterprise security</font>

44
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">API this is where you put your</font>

45
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,240
validation this is where you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,100
output encoding this is where you put

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,209
your access control this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you</font>

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">put your authentication logging a</font>

49
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,060
anything that's a security concern I

50
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,430
mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

51
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,340
this is by no means a complete list of

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the controls you should have but</font>

53
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,810
this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to illustrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does that</font>

54
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,549
look a little more manageable I think

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,989
that's much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier from an architect</font>

56
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:28,840
perspective from a developer perspective

57
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:33,040
from a manager perspective to manage

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,019
it's easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change you know right now</font>

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,989
if you've got a java ee application

60
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,730
you're probably using log4j but as log4j

61
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,920
still going to be the de facto standard

62
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,399
in five years

63
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,890
I don't know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would much rather</font>

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,690
switch out my logging layer right down

65
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,109
here at the bottom rather than try and

66
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,000,000 437,000 classes</font>

67
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,090
and changed the one line to point to a

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,109
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee so that's what the</font>

69
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,750
isapi is it's a centralized managed

70
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,650
externalized security service that

71
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,019
provide your security controls for you

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,599
so with that now that we've got kind of

73
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,760
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> overview I want to have</font>

74
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,619
Kevin come up here and what Kevin's

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,260
going to do is he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you</font>

76
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,750
all cryptography experts III don't know

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,660
maybe that was a little overkill but

78
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,880
Kevin redid the completely retooled the

79
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,310
encryption libraries for a sappy two

80
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,640
point oh and he's done some really cool

81
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,830
stuff that while it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> well documented we</font>

82
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,329
get a lot of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so what</font>

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,580
I wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was give him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance to</font>

84
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">come up and explain what he actually did</font>

85
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:50,130
and what those changes actually mean

86
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:53,100
hello my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kevin wolff um you</font>

87
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:59,209
probably know me mostly from my 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> page</font>

88
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:02,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">post so that he SAT the users lists love</font>

89
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,440
Kevin<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other Kevin already basically</font>

90
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,780
said pretty much everything that's up

91
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,640
here the only major thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

92
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,130
basically is that on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> owasp parise</font>

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,010
happy so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the only contributor</font>

94
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,450
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't actually contributed any code</font>

95
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,099
personally I like that way because me

96
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,289
and C++ don't get along too much but um

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,750
basically the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

98
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,800
occasionally write a blog if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody in</font>

99
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,800
here ever read my blog

100
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:41,150
that's good Kevin wasted your time then

101
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,419
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um today basically I wanted</font>

102
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,438
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple things on</font>

103
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:47,688
essentially why didn't make the changes

104
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,569
what was broke about it what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to</font>

105
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then end with an advanced</font>

106
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,759
example of the some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that</font>

107
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,359
Senator Dodd<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it just goes beyond like</font>

108
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,080
a simple encryption stuff um when I

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,020
started on these happy two years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

110
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,740
little bit more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years ago the</font>

111
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:14,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">ga version was 14 and we were at I think</font>

112
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,550
to auto release candidate to and when i

113
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,080
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started looking at it for our</font>

114
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,669
company basically the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

115
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,400
noticed was basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypt that was</font>

116
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,109
completely broken and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,539
that first jumped out at me was

118
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,979
basically we were using password based

119
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:32,330
encryption that's what PBE stands for

120
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:36,830
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm we were using</font>

121
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:40,279
those PBE with md5 and des the problem

122
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:45,289
with PBE is that the passwords basically

123
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:47,839
almost always create week keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like</font>

124
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:51,050
to get basically for instance thick this

125
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,589
is encrypt with with DES useless md5

126
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,979
runs the hash on md5 20 times basically

127
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,659
to end up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a does key in order to</font>

128
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,389
basically get something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

129
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,819
equivalent to a randomly chosen does key

130
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:08,150
56-bit does key you would need something

131
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,279
over 20 characters typically so most

132
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,710
people don't make it keys like master

133
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,800
key or whatever that long so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

134
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,128
problem was basically that we picked two

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,129
different but very weak algorithms does

136
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,710
an mp5 does is long ft<font color="#CCCCCC"> six bits well</font>

137
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,870
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute-forcing there's custom</font>

138
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,900
hardware that they made years ago the

139
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,819
Electronic Frontier Foundation funded it

140
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,698
basically pro fit within less than 24

141
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,680
hours brute<font color="#E5E5E5"> force</font>

142
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,310
md5 if you saw the last talked basically

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,610
it's not like what 21 bits or something

144
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:46,699
so those in a week in a later version of

145
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:50,570
one dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> for we change this to PB ii with</font>

146
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:53,180
sha-1 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> desi de which is Triple DES so</font>

147
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,150
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better but still not</font>

148
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,669
quite great the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

149
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,409
uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> cbc cipher mode which I'll mention</font>

150
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,948
here in a couple minutes you'll see what

151
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:06,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or I mean I'm</font>

152
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,470
saying sorry it does use yeah use the

153
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,500
CBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> and PS cs5 padding but that</font>

154
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,139
basically meant that it's prone to

155
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,169
basically work with padding attacks

156
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,970
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk later well so was a big</font>

157
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,340
problem was it had a single encryption

158
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,229
key now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might not think that's a</font>

159
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,940
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of you but like if you</font>

160
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,919
wanted to send you know an encrypted

161
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,289
credit card data at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MasterCard and</font>

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,840
it's another trip to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card</font>

163
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:34,669
data to save ISA you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

164
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,320
the same encryption key for both of them

165
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:37,729
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go over</font>

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">well with either one of those credit</font>

167
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,520
card companies so um that was a serious

168
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,010
problem then there's a default setting

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for master key and master</font>

170
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">salt which you know that's basically</font>

171
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,229
like setting default passwords and

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,740
applications we don't do that it's not

173
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,539
advised it's not best practice and then

174
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,910
lastly there was no message authenticity

175
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:01,490
and that basically became important

176
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:08,740
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CBC's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> promoted PK cs5</font>

177
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:12,199
padding in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2 dot 0 early releases</font>

178
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,020
the default iron was changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> 256-bit</font>

179
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">debt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does that's better but one of the</font>

180
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,859
things is with 256-bit des you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

181
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">download the unlimited strength</font>

182
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,210
jurisdiction policy files that basically

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:29,210
meant that you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside</font>

184
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the United States although I wouldn't</font>

185
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that they couldn't do it it</font>

186
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,200
basically weren't technically legally

187
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,789
allowed to do it and so you basically

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,780
are excluding a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

189
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,729
making their life difficult the other

190
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,370
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a switch to basically</font>

191
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,000
use

192
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,130
CB mode they basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just used a es by</font>

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,650
default which basically uses ECB mode

194
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,570
and because cs5 padding and there was no

195
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,220
way to switch it to use other modes

196
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,630
because every other mode requires an

197
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,980
initialization vector it was still and

198
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,830
restricted to a single key still had

199
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,190
default settings for master secret

200
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,990
master salt but they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

201
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,089
change them but you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through a</font>

202
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,600
whole bunch of contortions to do it and

203
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,370
still a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticity and when I</font>

204
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,500
say message authenticity basically I'm

205
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,570
saying is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to ensure</font>

206
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the ciphertext basically came from</font>

207
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,320
the the Thunder<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

208
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,990
came from ok now let's dump back here

209
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,610
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with ECB mode well here's</font>

210
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,000
the plain text version over the tux

211
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:39,660
image and here's an encrypted version

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,990
seeing the similarity right the problem

213
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,209
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ECB mode is basically</font>

214
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,050
patterns that are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plaintext show</font>

215
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">up those patterns in the ciphertext</font>

216
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,609
ideally what we want when we encrypt

217
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,339
like a plain text multiple times as you

218
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,529
want it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> to encrypt a different</font>

219
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:03,630
ciphertext<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I encrypt you</font>

220
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:07,320
know chris schmidt that hola slot comp

221
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,730
or multiple times right it encrypts

222
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,000
every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted it basically</font>

223
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,820
comes up with a different ciphertext and

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,839
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to do that one we use</font>

225
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:22,440
other things like um like CDC and the

226
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,900
random IV<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

227
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,040
why do we need message authenticity well

228
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:31,500
um that basically you know ensures that

229
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,439
the IV and cipher texts authentic of all

230
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,379
why is that important well how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

231
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,489
your number padding Oracle attack

232
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:43,589
good they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically got an attack</font>

233
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,209
like that there was a tool called pellet

234
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,459
right but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed like for</font>

235
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,219
instance in asp.net you could basically

236
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:56,909
decrypt the viewstate and eventually

237
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:58,829
discovered a cipher key<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

238
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,479
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a padding Oracle tech I'm not</font>

239
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,258
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a lot of details but it was</font>

240
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:08,639
first described way back in 2002 in the

241
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:12,029
context of ipsec by<font color="#CCCCCC"> serge lawn today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,099
is attack on CBC mode where you to have

243
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,919
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle Oracle basically as well as</font>

244
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:19,529
the padding is correct or not typically

245
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,720
and that's either leaked out by maybe a

246
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,659
different exception message or it could

247
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">be done via timing attacks and stuff</font>

248
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:30,539
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so basically what's the big</font>

249
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,569
deal about it well the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

250
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">the adversary can basically go through</font>

251
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,429
and allows them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt stuff without</font>

252
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:41,159
knowledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the secret key and it works</font>

253
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:43,259
it's very efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's like you</font>

254
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:46,289
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the demos they had</font>

255
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,479
with poet basically was compressed a

256
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:51,629
little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean basically seen it</font>

257
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:54,179
like work within 20 minutes the word

258
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,489
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually crack the viewstate I</font>

259
00:11:54,179 --> 00:12:00,119
know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like on a ordinary you</font>

260
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:01,259
know laptop I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer you know</font>

261
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,149
if you want more details<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

262
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,089
actually really recommend reading this

263
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:09,029
it basically explained it very well but

264
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">brian</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Holyfield's awash presentation oz</font>

265
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:17,999
blog basically describes how the padding

266
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:20,039
attack actually works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um major</font>

267
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:22,139
changes but first thing we did is we

268
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,089
there was a lot of methods that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

269
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,789
deprecated and a few even that we were

270
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:29,369
removed that we're just considered

271
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:31,709
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to unsafe the ones that are</font>

272
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:33,269
deprecated we actually changed their

273
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:38,369
behavior so that technically they're not

274
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:41,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">really compatible with the old version</font>

275
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there decided this basically</font>

276
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,970
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't if you hadn't persisted</font>

277
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,100
any of your data at least would be able

278
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to live a little bit of swooping it in</font>

279
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,860
the new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> them without changing</font>

280
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,620
your coat immediately we put in support

281
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,360
for cipher text objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

282
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,829
basically return<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two strings because</font>

283
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,290
when you encrypt that's basically what

284
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:04,290
you get back as a cipher text and then

285
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,240
thats I protects allows you to serialize

286
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,069
things so that you can put it out or you

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,110
can get different aspects of the cipher

288
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,930
and now the ciphertext basically

289
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,180
contains not only the actual raw cypher

290
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,410
text but it contains basically the

291
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,359
carries around with it the

292
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,370
initialization vector it carries around

293
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
with it the cipher algorithm recycle

294
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,880
transformation that it was used so has

295
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,959
basically everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end</font>

296
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,240
needs to decrypt it we had it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

297
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,819
plain<font color="#E5E5E5"> text object and partly that was</font>

298
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,310
for some symmetry but also it was mostly

299
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,290
for being because strings are not the

300
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,229
only thing to people on crypt right I

301
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,060
mean you may want to encrypt images may

302
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,000
want to encrypt them some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other kind of</font>

303
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,649
binary data this basically does the

304
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,170
transformation to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

305
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">always uses utf-8 encoding because if</font>

306
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,170
you don't and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that across like</font>

307
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,100
different operations something like

308
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,920
spark running solaris and windows on you

309
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,200
know 8086 basically it won't work

310
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,529
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the different encoding types</font>

311
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,959
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are native to platforms we had a</font>

312
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,670
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for multiple secret keys you can</font>

313
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">specify now when you encrypt and decrypt</font>

314
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,740
a specific secret key we added a support

315
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,300
from muscles authenticity to get rid of

316
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,370
the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

317
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">oracle padding or padding Oracle text</font>

318
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,270
their support in there for mobile site

319
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,579
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian set of modes but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't</font>

320
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,560
they basically Slifer algorithms so you

321
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">even basically switch between them the</font>

322
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,790
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a threat</font>

323
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:37,089
safe mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mostly added that</font>

324
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,660
because I needed a way to be able to

325
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:41,800
easily do the unit tests to test make

326
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,140
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it worked with different</font>

327
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,819
algorithms so I wouldn't really advise

328
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,930
doing that unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like putting</font>

329
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,430
explicit locks around your stuff

330
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:54,670
that will make that thread safe in the

331
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,170
201 stuff but the part of the problem is

332
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the only way that had to</font>

333
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:03,069
do it is basically change the properties

334
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:05,800
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know on flyers on and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

335
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,800
change to basically to use the strong

336
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,990
default so we the<font color="#E5E5E5"> default that we picked</font>

337
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,609
was picked first of all was the intent

338
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that basically we could use it out of</font>

339
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,180
the box and it would still be strong

340
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:19,449
that meant basically you didn't have to

341
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,878
download the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aea you know the unlimited</font>

342
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,878
strength jurisdiction policy so we use

343
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:29,079
aes CB c pkc has five hat padding

344
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:32,379
128-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> key instead of 256-bit key and a</font>

345
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,540
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> initialization vector and it</font>

346
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:36,490
turns out actually that in some regards

347
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some like related key attacks that in</font>

348
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:45,040
some ways actually make um 256-bit keys

349
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,800
a little bit more insecure in circus or

350
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,069
circumstances the authenticity basically

351
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,189
we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> an H max sha-1 basically is it's</font>

352
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:56,620
like a double application of the sha-1

353
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:58,779
algorithm so it's basically HTH I want

354
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,050
is still considered safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> sha1 by itself</font>

355
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,050
is not

356
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:11,430
come on oops they're backing<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

357
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,430
page in the back page

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,950
he's good at<font color="#E5E5E5"> crypto he's still learning</font>

359
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:24,980
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use computers I know use APIs I'm</font>

360
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:27,920
a poor man i can't afford happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

361
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,370
um this is basically the exams example

362
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,530
how many a year on google plus a few of

363
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,480
you say you've seen like these basically

364
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">these advertisements these notifications</font>

365
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,830
they send out that you get some punch in

366
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,990
the email from other people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

367
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,910
worry this is not my real one so you you

368
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,220
know if you want it if you want an

369
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,680
invitation from me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have 100 250</font>

370
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,190
of them well so does send me an email be

371
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,060
glad to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you but presumably</font>

372
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,530
Google's using some kind of

373
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,239
cryptographic token here although they

374
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,569
could be just using an object reference

375
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,700
into a database but it looks more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

376
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,590
cryptographic token and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

377
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting in a database is then when it</font>

378
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,220
expires in 30 days or whatever they're

379
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have to clean out the database the</font>

380
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,790
cryptographic token you just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

381
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has an automatic expiration so</font>

382
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,639
there's a related<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

383
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,709
would you pick you know if you wanted to

384
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,420
implement if you wanted to implement

385
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,130
something similar but like for our

386
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,070
coupon server so you could email you

387
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,020
know how would you do that well you

388
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:30,230
could do it if you have the appropriate

389
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,970
cryptographic token with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ease happy you</font>

390
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,320
know basically well if anything you

391
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,810
basically would want to put like the

392
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,610
authenticated users name a target

393
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,980
looking of your friend you're going to

394
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,040
send to merchandise ID to recognize what

395
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,310
they're trying to buy or coupons for

396
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,629
coupon value<font color="#CCCCCC"> and expiration date etc so</font>

397
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,480
basically all thanked said we want it

398
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,540
basically to protect make the identities

399
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,040
confidential we make the token

400
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,139
unfortunate am parang immune<font color="#E5E5E5"> the replay</font>

401
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,590
attacks at least have the ability to

402
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it immune to replays well if you</font>

403
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,100
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that it might if you had to</font>

404
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,620
write all that from scratch it would

405
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,780
take a considerable amount of code was

406
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,189
East happy you got basically two pieces

407
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,870
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the basically crates to toke</font>

408
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,620
another one of the validates the token

409
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,989
the creation of the token is

410
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,790
actually this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of code and</font>

411
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,610
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know these notes are going</font>

412
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:23,790
to be posted i'm not going to like read

413
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,699
through every line the one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

414
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,710
point out that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can crypto token the</font>

415
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,059
constructor will also take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret key</font>

416
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,270
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other than</font>

417
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:35,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> master key and personally I would</font>

418
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,100
recommend not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using just a master key</font>

419
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:42,150
for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose that's not a good</font>

420
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,320
practice but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

421
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this you'd have to store not</font>

422
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,090
somewhere to prevent replays if you

423
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,880
wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then consuming the</font>

424
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,040
token those are basically your steps and

425
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,770
you have some business logic steps in

426
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,059
there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left out but basically</font>

427
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:01,470
that's all there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it some of your</font>

428
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,300
third speaker I change clothes real

429
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,300
quick so it would be new and interesting

430
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,630
that's an awesome sound

431
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my presentations and</font>

432
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,650
Prezi<font color="#E5E5E5"> laelia does anybody use Prezi this</font>

433
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,860
is like the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome thing I've ever</font>

434
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen in my entire life so now we get to</font>

435
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,530
the fun stuff so we're going to talk

436
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:34,050
about what what is in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

437
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,030
sappy so the title of this talk was

438
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,090
defense against the dark arts that's my

439
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,830
code name for a sappy it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

440
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,540
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually thought about dressing up</font>

441
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,129
like Professor Snape for this talk but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

442
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,210
couldn't secure a costume as close to

443
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:50,250
Halloween<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus like just I don't look</font>

444
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that good in professor snape costume so</font>

445
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,170
for those who haven't seen it this is

446
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand-new fresh logo for a sappy so</font>

447
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,250
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start seeing this all</font>

448
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,470
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place it's going to be on all</font>

449
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the books that you know you guys are all</font>

450
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish about this after this</font>

451
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:09,150
talk so so in a sappy to tato we made a

452
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,580
bunch of various improvements<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin</font>

453
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,200
talked about the crypto some of the

454
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,949
other improvements we made we made it a

455
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,120
lot simpler for developers to implement

456
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,610
what the controls were and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

457
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,689
ongoing process so it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

458
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:26,939
get easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and easier as we go we also</font>

459
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,020
added better and years of support

460
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,070
options so we have a chat channel now

461
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,710
we're at we're in the process of

462
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,240
bringing up some forums so it's easier

463
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on there bug me and</font>

464
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,180
asked me how<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the hell do I do this</font>

465
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,980
thing that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and</font>

466
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,720
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll answer you we also</font>

467
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,780
heavily heavily heavily increase our

468
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,840
test coverage this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a big problem and</font>

469
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,389
a sappy 1.4 we had about 23% test

470
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,919
coverage of overall our code which for a

471
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,930
security library that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

472
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,250
something to brag about so we're

473
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:03,780
currently up to in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 80s somewhere of</font>

474
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,620
as far as our test coverage goes so it's

475
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,200
a significantly better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know as</font>

476
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,580
as we continue coding will hopefully

477
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,580
someday reach 100 percent

478
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,879
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap</font>

479
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:21,479
so for those that aren't aware on

480
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:23,580
Tuesday we held a summit for a sappy so

481
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,019
we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together locked</font>

482
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,029
everybody into a room for eight hours

483
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,919
and said okay what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do with</font>

484
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> project it's time to figure out</font>

485
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,610
what the next steps are going to be

486
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sappy 2.1</font>

487
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,110
means there's a lot of big buzz words

488
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,039
flying around all over the place so

489
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:42,418
let's let's put it into perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

490
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,950
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what it came up</font>

491
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,799
with the first big thing is we need to

492
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,169
redefine what the manifesto is of a

493
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,009
sappy I mean we you know Southie started

494
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:55,139
out by jeff williams five years ago and

495
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:57,330
he had a very very clear concise idea of

496
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:59,908
what he wanted to be and a lots changed

497
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:01,949
in the last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's new</font>

498
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:03,720
needs so it's one of the big things

499
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,460
we're doing is we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

500
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,639
time to really redefine what the library

501
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,120
is what it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be where the holes</font>

502
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,620
are that it needs to fill so in part of

503
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that first thing we need to do is</font>

504
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,500
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> redefine the project</font>

505
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,789
vision and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter right so that's</font>

506
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,529
the high<font color="#E5E5E5"> level stuff that I was just</font>

507
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:23,158
talking about what what is this library

508
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:24,750
actually next thing we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do so</font>

509
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,669
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here have done threat</font>

510
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,980
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume at least four of you</font>

511
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have so threat models aren't fun but</font>

512
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,940
they're necessary in those cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

513
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,080
security library absolutely needs to

514
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,570
know what the threats are for the

515
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,830
controls that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to provide so</font>

516
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,149
we're going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some threat models and</font>

517
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,809
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make those available as</font>

518
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:46,860
part of the isapi project generally

519
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:48,658
they're going to be documentation we're

520
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,209
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define the architecture more</font>

521
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,799
clearly right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the one of the</font>

522
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,399
major problems with the savvy at least

523
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,039
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java is that the architecture is</font>

524
00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not really well-defined you can't</font>

525
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,110
get a really good overview

526
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I totally get what you're</font>

527
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,100
saying you know you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> email me and</font>

528
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:11,060
then I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you say oh I</font>

529
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,770
totally get what you're saying and last

530
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,929
but not least we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to create the</font>

531
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,260
user story how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually intend for</font>

532
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,640
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this you know how are</font>

533
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,980
people going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are people</font>

534
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,200
going to abuse this so that's going to

535
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">be really important as we go forward in</font>

536
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:29,090
and some of these other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'm going</font>

537
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,700
to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing we're doing</font>

538
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:35,720
and this is a big big big big big big

539
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,370
big thing is koponen ization and anybody

540
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,350
who is currently using<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many people</font>

541
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:43,189
actually are currently using a sappy or

542
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,810
have used to savvy so a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you so</font>

543
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,750
good i get to corrupt a whole bunch of

544
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,550
new guys it's great so component ization

545
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,990
is one of the biggest problems with a

546
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,060
sappy two point oh and i know it's

547
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,770
holding a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people back right now</font>

548
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you pull down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a savvy for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> java you</font>

549
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:00,920
pull down basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire maven</font>

550
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,360
repository of dependencies which for any

551
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,670
large enterprise that's obviously a

552
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,959
problem so one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we're</font>

553
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,720
doing with 2.1 is we're going to

554
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,400
separate the api out and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that</font>

555
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,900
you know i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get the isapi</font>

556
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,580
without downloading all the dependencies

557
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,740
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can get the pieces that I</font>

558
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,879
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about components</font>

559
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,000
when I'm talking about is the individual

560
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,950
controls within his at me we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

561
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">implement the components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that controls</font>

562
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,180
themselves in a pluggable architecture

563
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,370
so I'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just plug in the</font>

564
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,420
piece that I want and that's what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

565
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use we're going to create controls</font>

566
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,980
that can also stand on their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

567
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,750
so if you if you have cases where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

568
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,240
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the isapi but you want</font>

569
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use the isapi encoders what by all</font>

570
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">means you can do that and last but not</font>

571
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,750
least we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create behavioral</font>

572
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,310
tests in addition to the unit tests we

573
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to create behavioral</font>

574
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,629
tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exercise control so my</font>

575
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,250
authenticator is not going to work in

576
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,560
your application I think that's pretty

577
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,510
obvious so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do rather than</font>

578
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,550
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to solve your problem</font>

579
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,930
is we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a set of behavioral</font>

580
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,090
tests that ensure that your

581
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,980
authenticator acts as it should be

582
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,300
acting and we can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as part</font>

583
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:16,600
of the

584
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">bi documentation so this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a huge</font>

585
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,459
complaint with the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

586
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,500
understandably<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I myself am a</font>

587
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,770
developer I like writing code I hate

588
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,780
writing words so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font>

589
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,750
we're actively reaching out to the

590
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,490
community for and we're reaching out to

591
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,560
have people help us do this because it's

592
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,300
we know it's important but I'd rather

593
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,379
not write documentation because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

594
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:43,800
good at it so we've come up with this

595
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,940
idea of organic and community driven

596
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,159
documentation this is where you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

597
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,200
tell us how you use the sappy and you

598
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,820
get to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> people this is going to have</font>

599
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,140
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of components to it and it's</font>

600
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,870
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the isapi community</font>

601
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,490
which I'll talk about in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font>

602
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,709
so the first big was it is integration

603
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,300
guide how helpful is an integration yet

604
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,040
it's probably the most valuable document

605
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,200
I've ever used for any library how do I

606
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this thing work in my spring MVC</font>

607
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,420
application I mean that's it really

608
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,419
doesn't get much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> descriptive</font>

609
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,560
questions answer questions and answers

610
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,679
so this is another like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> visualize</font>

611
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:24,340
stack exchange so we want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

612
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:27,270
savvy right so you know Kevin comes up

613
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,980
and says hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I do this thing and</font>

614
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:32,530
you know Jason answers and he says oh

615
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,970
you do it this way and then you guys all

616
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,410
get to comment on them and tell them you

617
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,130
know thumbs up them down you're wrong

618
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,820
you're dumb you're smart whatever

619
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,970
obviously they'll probably be some

620
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,169
moderation there

621
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,290
adoption story so this is another one

622
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how many people saw I just a real</font>

623
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,129
quick show of hands how many people are

624
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,640
security professionals<font color="#CCCCCC"> that develop or</font>

625
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,380
that don't develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and how many of</font>

626
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are developers that either do or</font>

627
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,960
don't do security that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5050</font>

628
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,059
even split<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty impressive so</font>

629
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,530
adoption stories as a developer I've

630
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,350
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the position where I've had to</font>

631
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,850
sit in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my manager and say I</font>

632
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:13,959
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it goes cool</font>

633
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:15,520
why what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get from it and that's a</font>

634
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,900
hard question to answer as a developer

635
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,850
right because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot of really</font>

636
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,580
good reasons why but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you explain</font>

637
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:23,020
that to somebody who's not a developer

638
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,330
it's like oh because it's cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

639
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,160
makes me that lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> me do things and do</font>

640
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,540
less work well that's great but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

641
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">what my manager doesn't care that I'm</font>

642
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,120
doing less work because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

643
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give me more so the second side of</font>

644
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,750
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community drug</font>

645
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,490
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again community-driven is a big key</font>

646
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,559
here because this documentation is not

647
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,559
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know how to use my library this</font>

648
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,540
documentation is for you guys so we've

649
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,270
reached out to the community and a lot

650
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,770
of this came from the acceptance on it

651
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,179
so one of the biggies that came up is it

652
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,790
would be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> great if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was some</font>

653
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:57,220
how-to video tutorials or just tutorials

654
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,668
in general right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a developer</font>

655
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,950
and you have a PC ice can donate your

656
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,270
auditor wats up or your manager walks up

657
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,820
and hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a report the first thing</font>

658
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">on report is you have xss everything</font>

659
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,860
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC I report starts with you</font>

660
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> xss</font>

661
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,559
now most developers are going to say

662
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,299
that's great when the house access has

663
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i get on google when i say what</font>

664
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell is XSS and you know I find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob</font>

665
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,690
site because I wasp is obviously the

666
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">only place to go to find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

667
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:32,370
exercises now that's great how do i

668
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,929
texted well that is absolutely the most

669
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,419
loaded question that nobody ever answers

670
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,679
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> right how do you fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

671
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,450
vulnerabilities that you see on your

672
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,630
report that you get from the scanning

673
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,250
for so what was recommended is it would

674
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,620
be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> great if we can have a series</font>

675
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,480
of videos that said presented that exact

676
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,909
scenario I'm a developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a report</font>

677
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,470
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability that I need to</font>

678
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,860
fix what are the steps that I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

679
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">take how do i fix it with a sappy so</font>

680
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,719
we're going to do a whole series of

681
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:02,850
how-to videos and tutorials to go along

682
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,400
with those for those of you that don't

683
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,649
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube because they still exist</font>

684
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,790
somewhere so we're going to be doing

685
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:14,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">that next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is cheat sheet so the cheat</font>

686
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:17,129
sheet series 40 wasp has been hugely

687
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:19,679
hugely popular everybody loves them it's

688
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,360
like a quick reference guide right so

689
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,230
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing cheat sheets</font>

690
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:30,330
along the same lines how do i fix XSS in

691
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:33,750
my insert thing here what are the

692
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,668
recommended ways to resolve session

693
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,080
management issues so we're going to

694
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:42,270
develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole series of cheat sheets</font>

695
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,918
around each individual control quick

696
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,990
start guide so this is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

697
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,750
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy the router at the store and</font>

698
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,480
you take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and it's got a book and</font>

699
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,320
it's got a card do you read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book or</font>

700
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,500
do you read the card neither well yeah

701
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:02,340
there you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an acronym</font>

702
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,429
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's rtfm know but the point</font>

703
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,840
here is is that people don't like words

704
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,429
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like writing words people don't</font>

705
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,010
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read a lot of words unless it's</font>

706
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a really great story right well you</font>

707
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I could probably write some pretty</font>

708
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,809
cool stories but it would make more

709
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:17,940
sense for me to just give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a quick</font>

710
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,320
reference guide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

711
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,790
put this in and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's going to</font>

712
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,220
work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me how do I make it work</font>

713
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,408
quickly

714
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,200
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> developing a quick</font>

715
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:28,299
start guide which will be published so

716
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,020
this will come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard copy if you order</font>

717
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:33,610
it or PDF so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

718
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,470
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the organization and develop or</font>

719
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,520
distribute to your developers or to your

720
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,350
security guys or to whoever and then

721
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">publish documentation so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

722
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally been working on a book for a</font>

723
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,120
sappy for the last three years that I

724
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:50,860
really just need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buckle down and</font>

725
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,510
finish and my hope is that around at the

726
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,010
same time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> two point one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out</font>

727
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be finishing that up I know there's</font>

728
00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:00,870
a couple other sappy publications in the

729
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,950
works as well so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot of</font>

730
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:07,719
documentation I think that's what I'm

731
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:12,130
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at plus I've got a really cool</font>

732
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,570
tree graphic that's cool stuff right so

733
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,880
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward so those are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

734
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,428
changes for 2.1 now obviously we've got

735
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,650
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do and unless</font>

736
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:22,000
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10 years for 2.1 to</font>

737
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:24,340
come out we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them all</font>

738
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">in so looking forward some of the other</font>

739
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,668
big things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've got coming up is</font>

740
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,720
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write up a full technical</font>

741
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:36,760
specification based on some work that

742
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:38,559
some the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISO is working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

743
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,970
ironically based off of a sappy and

744
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,350
we're going to base our work off of his

745
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,590
work so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a circular</font>

746
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,840
weird standards thing but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

747
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,178
do up a whole technical specification

748
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,789
for the entire API and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal here is</font>

749
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:53,559
that I can hand you with specification

750
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,440
and say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need you to write me an up and</font>

751
00:31:53,559 --> 00:32:00,280
comer and you understand what I mean

752
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,500
when I say that we're going to rethink

753
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,490
all of the various controls we're going

754
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to analyze a scope that includes things</font>

755
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,950
like hey what about Miss happy for

756
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,469
iphone what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sappy for</font>

757
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:18,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android what about a sappy for my ass</font>

758
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:21,820
400 that lives in the closet yes they're

759
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,799
still out there so you know there's

760
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,860
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different scope now than there</font>

761
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,529
was five years ago and so this this will

762
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:34,029
partly be reflected in 2.1 but this is a

763
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:37,470
much larger grander vision where you'll

764
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:42,630
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a sappy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on any platform</font>

765
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:46,600
on any operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> system on any language</font>

766
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're working towards we're</font>

767
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,389
going to completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> redefine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arihan</font>

768
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,120
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> while they're handling it's</font>

769
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:53,979
based off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java which is great if</font>

770
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,239
you're writing in Java but if you happen

771
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in anything other than</font>

772
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,980
Java there's only like 47 other

773
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,659
languages you can write a web app in and

774
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,760
not all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them support exceptions one</font>

775
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,200
so we're going to rethink the error

776
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,850
handling model error handling is

777
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,490
something that's very important in the

778
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,379
security app as I'm sure all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

779
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,940
so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we come up</font>

780
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">with something that's portable that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

781
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,190
be used across all the various

782
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,269
implementations of us happy the other

783
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,919
big one is the enterprise security

784
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:22,539
configuration so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that</font>

785
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,970
I've actually been thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for</font>

786
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:30,309
going on two years now about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how</font>

787
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:32,080
to solve so right now I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> my isapi</font>

788
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,940
and thatís Abby has a configuration and

789
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,019
generally speaking that configuration is

790
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,190
going to be depending on what language

791
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:38,950
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration is going to be</font>

792
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:41,769
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> a properties file or an XML file</font>

793
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,960
well that's all fine and dandy but I've

794
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:46,630
got an enterprise application portfolio

795
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,740
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 apps I've got things that</font>

796
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,929
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want that's common between</font>

797
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,220
all 50 of those apps and then I've got

798
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are going to be specific to</font>

799
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,190
a group of apps and then I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

800
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,389
that are going to be specific to a nap

801
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,019
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may've and have things are</font>

802
00:33:55,389 --> 00:34:02,979
specific to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> logged in user so the idea</font>

803
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:04,360
here is to create a portable enterprise

804
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,589
security configuration that could be

805
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:11,889
both centrally managed and can also be

806
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:13,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">overridden right so you can have a you</font>

807
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:15,139
can imagine a world where you've got

808
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,699
that exact scenario

809
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> farmer stretch so and I think</font>

810
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:21,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a pretty important thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

811
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:24,049
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out some models on how to do that</font>

812
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:30,710
now it's just a matter of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

813
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:33,619
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to do it so that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> road</font>

814
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">map now it's not illustrated here in</font>

815
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:36,589
this slide but one of the biggest

816
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,909
changes is coming to a sappy actually

817
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:41,659
has absolutely nothing to do with code

818
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:43,669
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we are merging all of</font>

819
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,389
the isapi projects into one project

820
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:49,368
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sappy and we are going to</font>

821
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,500
release implementations of that project

822
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:54,740
at sub-projects so it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot more</font>

823
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:57,049
like the log4j model right now if you

824
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,939
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a sappy it's like or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

825
00:34:57,049 --> 00:35:00,500
about a sappy the question I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

826
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,809
when i talk about as happy as well which

827
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,089
one are you talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you</font>

828
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,339
mean there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one no are you talking</font>

829
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:09,799
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> java or PHP or net or action</font>

830
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:12,609
script or Ruby or Grails or groovy or

831
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:15,288
whatever I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list goes on and on</font>

832
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:17,029
so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big change coming up to a</font>

833
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:19,670
sappy and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing some</font>

834
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:21,470
stuff working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sourceforge on that</font>

835
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:24,019
so I've got one minute so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

836
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,970
fly through this really quickly the

837
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,220
isapi community is the latest greatest

838
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,450
thing that's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up right so starting</font>

839
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,009
at the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year we're</font>

840
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,348
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something very similar to</font>

841
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:34,819
the jQuery community you're going to

842
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:37,329
have user-contributed components like

843
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:43,720
plugins user-contributed documentation

844
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:47,529
forums live<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat articles and tutorials</font>

845
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,529
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

846
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:51,788
so thank you thank you everybody I want

847
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to I want to hand this off to Jason Lane</font>

848
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:55,299
so I work with them on the the global

849
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,940
projects committee we've got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

850
00:35:55,299 --> 00:36:00,249
cool stuff coming up as if anybody has

851
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,660
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sappy I will be in</font>

852
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:07,450
the room right next door right after

853
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:09,969
this in the open source showcase<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what</font>

854
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,160
yeah over there sorry I'll be in the

855
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:14,380
same room where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CTF is so please</font>

856
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:30,190
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> come find me ask me I'll be</font>

857
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:33,219
around good so first of all when thank

858
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:36,609
chris and kevin for giving me some other

859
00:36:33,219 --> 00:36:38,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">time from their presentation so you guys</font>

860
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,400
have probably don't even know this

861
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,009
because we didn't announce it very well

862
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,609
but this whole a lost track thing is

863
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:47,079
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new 40 oz we've had lots and</font>

864
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:49,450
lots of conferences and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots and</font>

865
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,940
lots of projects and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

866
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,950
done a good job of actually presenting

867
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:55,239
our own projects at most conferences so

868
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a new initiative and</font>

869
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,559
rather than steal an entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

870
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">slot to talk about all those projects in</font>

871
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:05,739
general<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stealing Chris's done</font>

872
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:07,299
so so the whole idea about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was that</font>

873
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,089
we were going to launch a no-loss

874
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:12,190
projects portal a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tap sec USA you can</font>

875
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:14,259
tell by the red script that this is not

876
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly going to happen but i'll talk</font>

877
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:19,390
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later so just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

878
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:21,009
about Louis projects there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have</font>

879
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">noticed there's an open-source showcase</font>

880
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:26,589
going on next door behind us and that's

881
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,509
all open source projects in general but

882
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:31,058
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight OS projects in</font>

883
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:32,319
general so what are lost projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

884
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:35,729
probably the biggest question i received

885
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:38,440
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> showcase and it's really easy</font>

886
00:37:35,729 --> 00:37:40,509
projects are open source and they're

887
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,249
free that's the bottom line for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our loss</font>

888
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:44,520
products anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start a project</font>

889
00:37:42,249 --> 00:37:48,330
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can contribute</font>

890
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,330
and anyone can use them so it's a an

891
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:54,420
open source community and it's fairly

892
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:56,819
popular we've got documentation projects

893
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,380
tool projects and code projects so how

894
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,520
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have actually you know</font>

895
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,170
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an osmotic treasure and</font>

896
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,000
almost the entire room and I assert that

897
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,740
anybody who did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not raise their hand is</font>

898
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,570
lying because I know you all just SAT

899
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,740
through Chris's talk so you know

900
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about our loss products so so</font>

901
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,750
the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I us projects have been</font>

902
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,760
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful we have over 140 over</font>

903
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,620
140 projects in various degrees of

904
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,330
maturity so what exactly is the problem

905
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,450
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have over a hundred</font>

906
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:35,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty projects how many people have</font>

907
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:39,419
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a Noah's project right so</font>

908
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,790
I won't attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exactly so I wanted</font>

909
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,250
to paste the wiki page of<font color="#E5E5E5"> OAuth projects</font>

910
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,050
up here i zoomed out to about a minus a

911
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,570
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent still couldn't fit on</font>

912
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,610
the slide so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best I could do</font>

913
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:53,120
see if you can find the project you're

914
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,120
looking for

915
00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:00,820
do you find it no I didn't think so so

916
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:03,310
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that we wanted to solve</font>

917
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,590
with the ostrich export we want to find

918
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,770
we wanted to provide a way for consumers

919
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually find projects we wanted to</font>

920
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,850
provide a way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our community to</font>

921
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,140
provide feedback for projects and for

922
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,450
our contributors to actually get

923
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,100
recognized<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their projects and of</font>

924
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,390
course you know we at the global

925
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,970
projects committee kind of had a little

926
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,650
bit of a selfish non altruistic part of

927
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,629
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the fact that we want to</font>

928
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,030
be able to manage and sort through the

929
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,680
project so it's not all it's all you

930
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,050
know warm and fuzzy<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

931
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,029
selfishness to it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really the</font>

932
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,820
point the vision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the OS projects</font>

933
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:39,609
portal so what did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do or what are we</font>

934
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:42,250
going to do well we partnered<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

935
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:44,350
source work we have a contract with them

936
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,840
geek net is other people behind

937
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">sourceforge and they are providing us an</font>

938
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,680
oz neighborhood to house all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

939
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,570
metadata that we can accumulate about

940
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,330
olas projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> so soon will come today</font>

941
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,590
when you can actually when our project

942
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,450
leaders will start tagging their own

943
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,250
projects and you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search by</font>

944
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,410
all right well I'm a developer and I

945
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,210
need something related to Java or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

946
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,759
something related to authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I</font>

947
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">need something related to a crypto or</font>

948
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,730
whatever and we'll be able to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font>

949
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:14,730
why do we actually want that well how

950
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:16,869
many people are familiar resource work

951
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,430
just about everybody so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

952
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:20,170
probably recognize this kind of summary

953
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:24,609
page that just every every project

954
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">Turner has on source work so if we go</font>

955
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:29,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to our goals that summary page is</font>

956
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,640
awesome because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a consistent</font>

957
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:32,290
look and feel to all the projects so

958
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,529
it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details that</font>

959
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for we get our feedback</font>

960
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,060
from the awesome community reviews then

961
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,220
hopefully one day we'll have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

962
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,490
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-star system that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon to</font>

963
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,259
us there's tons and tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugins that</font>

964
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,879
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available and we want to act</font>

965
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,950
this is actually kind of important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

966
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,110
our project leaders<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know not many of</font>

967
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room but we want to</font>

968
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually enable for our project leaders</font>

969
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,770
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they want so whether it's</font>

970
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,330
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourceforge infrastructure</font>

971
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,150
whether it's using their their own

972
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,710
infrastructure what have you we want

973
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,510
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use this portal so</font>

974
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,000
there's lots and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of options to</font>

975
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:12,070
support that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part again</font>

976
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,830
that selfish thing we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

977
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,510
organize and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather metadata about about</font>

978
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,420
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> own project so we can make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier</font>

979
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:22,870
for you all to download and find

980
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:25,000
actually use and promote the projects so

981
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,740
just a little background about why we

982
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have all that metadata and drive</font>

983
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:34,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that forward of the 140 projects which</font>

984
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:36,850
ones are the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> one give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer</font>

985
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,009
yeah I figured that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my faither case</font>

986
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,330
since we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the isapi room so the</font>

987
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is that we don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

988
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,130
good way of helping you guys out as

989
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,780
project consumers what's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> project</font>

990
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,850
what's not a good project what's still

991
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,240
developing what's mature what's awesome

992
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:54,970
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're moving forward with this</font>

993
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,379
whole idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having incubator labs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

994
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">flagship so how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are familiar</font>

995
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,970
with the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of incubator products and</font>

996
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:03,100
everyone kind of has a sense of what

997
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,959
means and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by those</font>

998
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,580
terms alone you kind of are able to

999
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,370
identify what projects are important

1000
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,710
which ones are and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

1001
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">having a projects portal is that whole</font>

1002
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:17,380
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be community driven</font>

1003
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:19,210
so a wasp is the big thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about loss is</font>

1004
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,000
that it's open<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we want to be</font>

1005
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:23,980
inclusive we want to have participation

1006
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,960
and the way we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that is</font>

1007
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,600
providing feedback to the project

1008
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,450
leaders to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consumers that will drive</font>

1009
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,029
this entire process so we're going to

1010
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:35,589
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open review system for going</font>

1011
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,380
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this elevation project process</font>

1012
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,490
where use it for benefits to project

1013
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,470
leaders and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it to</font>

1014
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,890
promote visibility so you guys can find

1015
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:46,529
the projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want so what was</font>

1016
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,990
our timeline well

1017
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,750
I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really aggressive I thought</font>

1018
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,149
you know okay the GPC is going to gather

1019
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,860
three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the conference and</font>

1020
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:59,400

1021
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,970
projects over from the wiki to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">source short order yeah well that</font>

1023
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,950
doesn't really turn out so well it's a

1024
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit harder to migrate a hundred</font>

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:12,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">and forty some odd projects and I</font>

1026
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,160

1030
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,470
projects leaders in the room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1031
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,570
to volunteer their projects what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1036
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:34,440
