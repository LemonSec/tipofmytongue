<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so good morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,700
we can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the OS captain mobile</font>

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,050
risks or maybe we should put the

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,299
subtitle in there you know why security

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,690
people can't count<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 12</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I everybody</font>

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,800
likes 10 so that's kind of we went with

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,810
all right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do brief</font>

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,859
introductions we can do some just a

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,479
little bit of background information on

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,800
the mobile security project why it

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,350
happened and what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,240
achieve we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover the mobile</font>

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,260
threat model the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level just</font>

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,750
kind of talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the attack surface</font>

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,740
mobile apps what makes them unique and

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,809
you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to think about</font>

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,579
applying controls we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

18
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual top 10 themselves and</font>

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,270
then when every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have left we're</font>

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,890
gonna do some Q&A and then we're going

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,980
to you know take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into the Q&A room</font>

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,450
after this so I just myself am I Jack

application security stuff back in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">east coast to practice back there like a</font>

also a co-leader we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project</font>

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,399
back in about Oh what was it q1 and no

33
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,320
yeah and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last year into the first</font>

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,380
quarter of this year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually went</font>

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wasp summit in Portugal this past</font>

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,060
spring believe is it was in the spring

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,520
and we really kicked off the initiative

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,540
to start honing the the OS mobile top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,100
there my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zack linear I'm a</font>

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,829
asst group I just became a<font color="#E5E5E5"> co here the</font>

42
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,509
project a few months ago so we've kind

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,798
of been hammering this out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jack will</font>

44
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,579
explain a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

45
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,579
history of the project

46
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:52,249
so the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> started towards the end</font>

47
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,840
of last year and really the initial

48
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,130
motivated for the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> was coming</font>

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,549
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Def Con last</font>

50
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,990
year there were a lot of talks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

51
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:02,270
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how how broke</font>

52
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,219
every application like out there is the

53
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,600
platform soft you know develop it as a

54
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">idiots you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usual stuff but</font>

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,899
really nothing anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take back</font>

56
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,098
with them the next day of work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

57
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:11,569
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know go and build a</font>

58
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,970
better mobile application so that's kind

59
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,220
of where this project that came from so

60
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,980
my gun the on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

61
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,209
side you guys it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some of the</font>

62
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we have underway right now so</font>

63
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,989
absolutely we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

64
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,640
today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish some controls there's</font>

65
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,739
some stuff out there for training<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

66
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,349
there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igo project which actually</font>

67
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,750
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here today but imagine web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goat</font>

68
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:34,910
for iOS that's what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's the</font>

69
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,160
goat droid project it's very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

70
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android and then hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like in the</font>

71
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,410
coming months we're actually going to

72
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,030
start taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff that's out there</font>

73
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,230
and start drilling into like really

74
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,730
platform specific guidance if you are

75
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,459
interested in contributing any way shape

76
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,988
or form we have probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more stuff that</font>

77
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,420
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do then then people at this</font>

78
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,889
point if you want to get involved just

79
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,119
please come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us email us get in</font>

80
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:58,120
touch somehow you'd be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

81
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,300
sure just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow up on that I mean</font>

82
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any initiative you can you</font>

83
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,580
see in the traditional wasp avenues<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,950
know we can have a mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of</font>

85
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,080
that so there really is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of a lot</font>

86
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,869
of opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to contribute and a lot</font>

87
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be done we're</font>

88
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to touch a little bit on the</font>

89
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,690
mobile threat model now to be honest

90
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,090
covering the mobile threat model could

91
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,400
be probably a 90 minute presentation in

92
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,980
and of itself and we've consolidated

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,990
that to three slides and the reason why

94
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,970
we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to discuss it now is</font>

95
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,920
that there are some people who say you

96
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">know why do we need the OS mobile</font>

97
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,170
project why can't we just have

98
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,670
traditional OS cover this stuff and you

99
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are a lot</font>

100
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,839
of big difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the typical</font>

101
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,359
web application threat model and the

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,790
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application threat model well</font>

103
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,210
touch on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them here mainly your</font>

104
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,739
platforms are going to vary with mileage

105
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,280
you know on the on the server side<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

106
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,830
the web application world you know we've

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,600
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things pretty much standardized you</font>

108
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,460
know at a high level but for the most

109
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,829
part anything that's going on on the

110
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,340
server you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> control what's</font>

111
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:17,870
happening now with these within mobile

112
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,700
is essentially we've kind of given the

113
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,340
developers a responsibility of now

114
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,349
writing the browser as well as the

115
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,390
server side component of everything so

116
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,510
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write their own browser you</font>

117
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,710
know a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and they need</font>

118
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand the platform because</font>

119
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,120
platforms are going to be different iOS

120
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,680
is a lot different than Android and

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,110
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you need to be aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

122
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,150
when coding for a certain platform that

123
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,740
can introduce security vulnerabilities

124
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,859
you know one example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes to mind</font>

125
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the screen shotting of an iOS</font>

126
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,880
application that can potentially store

127
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,290
sensitive data you know when you when

128
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,230
you close<font color="#CCCCCC"> your device or go to the home</font>

129
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,120
screen that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one example also</font>

130
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">different from the web application world</font>

131
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,640
are the traditional use cases are

132
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,050
typical use cases the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> device it's</font>

133
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,849
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pocket it's with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all the</font>

134
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,860
time and it's got access to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

135
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,530
data than your web application does or

136
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,960
that the web browser does it's got acts

137
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,688
direct access potentially to your client

138
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,089
information

139
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:17,459

tracking device that's with you all the

142
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,429

00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,199
browser or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a traditional web application</font>

144
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:26,789
but at the same time we still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

145
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,579
consider much more than what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

146
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:32,188
on the client side there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">back end remote web services now you can</font>

148
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,169
sync data seamlessly from your device up

149
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:40,529
into the cloud so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect that</font>

150
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,599
data how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect personal data as</font>

151
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,729
opposed to corporate data that may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

152
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:48,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same shared device so</font>

153
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:51,539
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions there we can</font>

154
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,929
also talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture</font>

155
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,779
of of mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices you know it's no</font>

156
00:05:54,929 --> 00:06:00,119
longer just an application talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to a web server now we've</font>

158
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:04,199
got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the broadband connection through</font>

159
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,149
the carrier where we're talking to the

160
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,709
cloud we've got all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the kind of</font>

161
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:13,679
alternate communication channels such as

162
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:15,089
SMS and<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone that are on the device as</font>

163
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:17,729
opposed to just your internet connection

164
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:20,009
then on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the left hand side of</font>

165
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,959
this image we see other forms of data

166
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:26,459
connectivity we've got bluetooth we've

167
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:28,889
got NFC we've got Wi-Fi all those

168
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:30,659
different interfaces for communication

169
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,169
can affect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you write your client</font>

170
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:36,089
application just a quick example of of

171
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,889
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can affect how you code an</font>

172
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,659
application you know we've seen apps

173
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,219
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

174
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone's broadband connection talking to</font>

175
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:44,429
the internet that way they're fun

176
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,679
they're using SSL but then there's some

177
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:48,748
logic that says oh if we're on Wi-Fi

178
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,188
don't use SSL so there are

179
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:52,259
considerations like that you know at

180
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:54,779
design time at an implementation time

181
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,569
that developers need to be aware of not

182
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,849
to mention the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

183
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">physical threat to the phone security if</font>

184
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,610
you lose that phone there can

185
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,979
potentially be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

186
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,509
device that can be easily accessed

187
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,679
through direct access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

188
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:13,259
that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't typically</font>

189
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:14,909
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about with either you know</font>

190
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,919
a desktop machine you're most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

191
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,329
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and even in a laptop</font>

192
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,159
you know we have controls like whole

193
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:23,339
disk encryption that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can protect data at</font>

194
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:25,449
rest if the device is lost or stolen so

195
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,020
a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of</font>

196
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:31,330
on a mobile device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just to represent</font>

197
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,948
all this information in another format

198
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,589
here we've kind of laid it out in a

199
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,930
stride format and as you can see it can

200
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">get very verbose and detailed very</font>

201
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,319
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why you know one of</font>

202
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,499
the things we need to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

203
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">project is an actual a detailed mobile</font>

204
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:50,229
threat modeling project within<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS mobile</font>

205
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,580
and like i said this can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 minute</font>

206
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:55,688
talk in and of itself so with that

207
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,729
that's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the rationale now we'll</font>

208
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:00,659
jump into the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 risks and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

209
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:03,839
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back to jack to start that all</font>

210
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:06,219
so part of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> one came here for right</font>

211
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,439
so the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 risks one of the</font>

212
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges was staying as platform</font>

213
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,710
agnostic as possible to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of</font>

214
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,960
make everything relevant across the

215
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,099
platforms but not being too generic we

216
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,710
were saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like you know bad</font>

217
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:20,139
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and stuff right so it's</font>

218
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice to be useful we focused on broader</font>

219
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,969
areas of risk vice you know individual

220
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,889
vulnerabilities themselves so you know

221
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:28,599
cross-domain something called hopping

222
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,460
blah blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

223
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,260
granular but we kind of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of broken</font>

224
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,088
down to the heirs of risk that encompass

225
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,990
all those things there are a lot of

226
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually helped out with</font>

227
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,979
just coming up with this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

228
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">post those on my next week to the wiki</font>

229
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:44,500
as well just so they get their fair

230
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,670
share of credit so here's what we see

231
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,130
the top down now keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this is</font>

232
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,560
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> release candidate so we're going to</font>

233
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">open it up for like 60 days some of they</font>

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,829
did with the web top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 a couple years</font>

235
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,139
ago we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want feedback I mean if</font>

236
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:58,329
you guys are out there testing up by the

237
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:01,060
way how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually attach the</font>

238
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:04,719
mobile apps and the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font>

239
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,670
all right yeah so um cool so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

240
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,050
you guys have anything to add if you

241
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,430
think anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't belong up</font>

242
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,740
there it should be higher or lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

243
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:16,180
list just please we really need the

244
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:19,060
feedback so first up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure data</font>

245
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,560
storage so this applies the stuff that's

246
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,018
on the device but we're also considering

247
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,849
the stuff that's on the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ends</font>

248
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,250
up say be in sync to say you know at

249
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,310
some point the iCloud or you know insert

250
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,350
anything else up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you're</font>

251
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,060
backing up data to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Google's</font>

252
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Android backup services or</font>

253
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,529
up

254
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,360
at some point that data is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

255
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,040
up somewhere that you just don't control

256
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,140
it whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be local</font>

257
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,199
backups to the cloud people going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

258
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,400
move the devices you really have to

259
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,779
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're putting on devices</font>

260
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
now the challenge is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean if you</font>

261
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:51,050
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch anything on the device you</font>

262
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't store anything well if someone's</font>

263
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,229
on the training or you know they're on a

264
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,089
plane it's up like that need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

265
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">data and they can't get them for hours</font>

266
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,520
you know that they're gonna be pretty

267
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,710
pitch they might find another app to use

268
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,920
so you have to balance you know those

269
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,120
those usability things with security but

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,310
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time this is going to be</font>

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,810
compliance requirements and you know you

272
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,209
shouldn't be starting credit cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS</font>

273
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,520
ends stuff like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should keep off</font>

274
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,680
there some platforms do a better job

275
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,819
providing stuff like blackberry kicks

276
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,810
everybody's ass in terms of like

277
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,970
encryption and stuff like that in

278
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices I mean I watched a little better</font>

279
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,400
in androids like you pretty much are on

280
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,400
your own so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> from last</font>

281
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,170
year the city phone citibank gap

282
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,459
everything you possibly do wrong they

283
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,589
did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were starting account</font>

284
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,690
information just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah really bad stuff</font>

285
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,220
and here's an example of um something

286
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,500
that you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is ridiculous but</font>

287
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,570
it's it's extremely common so here's

288
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,029
this actually like a screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> from go</font>

289
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,709
droid so here's remember me and then

290
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,260
here is you know world readable because

291
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,670
files really need to be more readable

292
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,890
and you've just you know broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

293
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,390
security model of how files or protect

294
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,160
and stuff like that here's username

295
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,970
password and then you do that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

296
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,949
you end up somewhere down in the fire so

297
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,570
the recommendation is just mean store

298
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,430
what's really necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean if you're</font>

299
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> overboard it's common sense is</font>

300
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,550
usually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevail nine times out</font>

301
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,890
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten if you're using something like</font>

302
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,589
the SD card or you know it's a different

303
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,779
file system it's not protected the same

304
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,060
way that stuff stored internally so you

305
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,930
definitely don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that and</font>

306
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,310
being leveraged what's there for the

307
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">platforms you know some platforms do a</font>

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,880
better job you know hopefully you know

309
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,990
is i scream same you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

313
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,310
platform you know definitely take

314
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,310
advantage of that

315
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,529
the next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a personal favorite of</font>

316
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,699
mine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of just randomly hashed</font>

317
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,170
out who is going to talk about which

318
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,079
risk and really glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I got to talk</font>

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,910
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one because every mobile</font>

320
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,099
pretty much every mobile application

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,140
that's useful is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

of web service restful web service or

325
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,930
even just a web app maybe it's doing

326
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,820
some screen scraping so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know</font>

331
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently looking at a mobile application</font>

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,519
going on and but your mobile and all

335
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,680
that stuff kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes out the window</font>

336
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,899
and started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the the server</font>

337
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,269
side of the app which initially wasn't

338
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:36,769
even necessarily considered in scope but

339
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,149
is obviously critical because that's

340
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,949
where all the data store that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

341
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,070
the mobile client is communicating with

342
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,420
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no state</font>

343
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,620
they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even using session</font>

weblogic and you know it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

346
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,040
things like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make you</font>

347
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,209
scratch your head these developers they

348
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,890
heard mobile and they just went down a

349
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,810
completely different path and ignored a

350
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,290
lot of things a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lessons that</font>

351
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:03,140
we've we've already learned a lot of

00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:05,180
other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other things we need</font>

353
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be aware of there's this idea that we</font>

354
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,160
can trust the client in mobile and we

355
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:12,890
can put you know make access control

356
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,899
decisions in the client code that's just

357
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,170
not a good idea if it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

358
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,060
it's accessible by an attacker it can't

359
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,860
be trusted all that stuff needs to be

360
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:26,420
baked into your server side into your

361
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,940
server application and you know what

362
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,130
word is this ultimately result in SQL

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sniff traffic and see what systems</font>

it was mobile but in reality it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

you know poor practices in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server side so really</font>

386
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,399
you know I wanted it to be pretty

387
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:33,250
tourists and number two in the OS mobile

388
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:37,660
top 10 was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> please co-op top 10 and</font>

389
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:39,550
wasp cloud top 10 and really you need to

390
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,110
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly address these sorts of</font>

391
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,569
vulnerabilities in your in your mobile

392
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">app assessments and also at design time</font>

393
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,430
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really important</font>

394
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,990
because for whatever reason at design

395
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,399
time when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people hear mobile they're</font>

396
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go down a different track they</font>

397
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,149
think it's different and again they

398
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,459
throw out a lot of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already know</font>

399
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,829
so prevention tips I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

400
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,380
basic you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know get involved at design</font>

401
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:07,959
time if you have that opportunity in

402
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:10,450
your organization and really push the

403
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:16,420
the other Oh asp resources that are

404
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:18,399
available so<font color="#E5E5E5"> number three on the list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

405
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,160
insufficient transport layer protection

406
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:25,089
so kind of what the example that was

407
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,469
given earlier was an app that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

408
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we'll actually will highlight it</font>

409
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,810
here in a second that would switch from

410
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:35,949
using SSL over the carrier's network to

411
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:37,540
not using SSL or TLS on a Wi-Fi because

412
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,740
that's probably someone at home so it's

413
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,550
considered a trusted network so

414
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes we will see people who just</font>

415
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,910
simply disregard encryption all together

416
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,370
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just assume it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

417
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,140
be over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trusted network or in some</font>

418
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,970
cases over the carrier's network where

419
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,220
you know it's in control of another

420
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,350
entity so let them handle all the all

421
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,350
the crypto and controls around<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

422
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,430
well one of the other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that often</font>

423
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:08,719
happens is ignoring a the chain of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

424
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:11,420
in ssl cert validation or simply just

425
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,070
just completely disregarding any errors

426
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,490
that might that might come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

427
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,290
invalid certs or simply switching over

428
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,430
to something like plain text transport

429
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,540
for if ssl ever fails so obviously this

430
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,060
lends<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself to things like</font>

431
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,319
man-in-the-middle attacks one of the

432
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,900
examples that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had actually given</font>

433
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,390
previously in a couple of talks that was

434
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,090
really silly was um the foursquare app

435
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:38,060
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android which has now been for some</font>

436
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,220
reason considered deprecated used to

437
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:44,030
send would actually authenticate over

438
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:47,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">using a HTTP basic authentication over</font>

439
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,650
non SSL encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Channel so if you're</font>

440
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,810
at Starbucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to check in on</font>

441
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,250
foursquare and<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

442
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,140
man-in-the-middle Z there then they can

443
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,750
check in I you know check you in strip

444
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,480
clubs or whatever so and everyone uses

445
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,520
foursquare don't lie so the example that

446
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was referring to earlier was an</font>

447
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,930
android client login security flaw

448
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,060
basically what Google was doing was for

449
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,740
certain certain applications or certain

450
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,169
services that they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink from</font>

451
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:15,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android handsets up to their their</font>

452
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,600
services they were encrypting most of

453
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,149
them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and again if</font>

454
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,188
they were over over Wi-Fi they would

455
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,740
fall back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plain text for certain</font>

456
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,540
services such as picasa so people could

457
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,490
actually attackers could actually pull

458
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,260
down the UM the<font color="#CCCCCC"> token</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was being</font>

459
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to you know for like the session</font>

460
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:37,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">token'</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you reuse that for other</font>

461
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,570
services so yeah this was a this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

462
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,730
basically what I just said so obviously

463
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,189
to help mitigate this or prevent it all

464
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,380
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you're doing anything</font>

465
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive such as</font>

sensitive in any sensitive data use

468
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,430
appropriate you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know SSL or TLS and I</font>

469
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,780
actually see someone in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back who can</font>

470
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,340
probably tell us why as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell is broken</font>

471
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:06,770
but regardless you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

472
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,810
encrypt anything as much as you can or

473
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,379
at least use a use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

474
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,820
on

475
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,130
that data safe leading the device and

476
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,689
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that even the carrier's</font>

477
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,160
network is necessarily trustworthy as

478
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,470
we've seen where things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM have</font>

479
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,920
been broken we can't necessarily trust

480
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,840
that network to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be safe and also</font>

481
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,600
validate that certificates are actually

482
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,050
are actually legit and don't just fall

483
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,790
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plain text transports for</font>

484
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:36,649
failures next up we have a client-side

485
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,480
injection so we group kind of every kind

486
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,600
of injection under here so whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

487
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,430
HTML script injection sequel injection

488
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,800
we just label this client-side injection

489
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,030
here so some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you know</font>

490
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,860
cross-site scripting I mean you know

491
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,330
applications you know starters every

492
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,520
single mobile device has a browser and

493
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,990
then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications will you know</font>

494
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,680
they'll integrate like some web stuff

495
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,510
and some you know application stuff so

496
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,610
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously have a mishmash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

497
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologies there so sequel injection</font>

498
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,770
on mobile devices it's not as ridiculous

499
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,180
as like say you know owning an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle</font>

500
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">back-end and having access to all kinds</font>

501
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,230
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really rich powerful things</font>

502
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,760
to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time and you can</font>

503
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,560
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> tampa bay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can still read stuff</font>

504
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,700
that's on the local device<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean which</font>

505
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,570
also ties into other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if</font>

506
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,820
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making some kind of security</font>

507
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,350
decisions based on the information that

508
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,760
say in a database something like that

509
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,699
well you know you can find creative ways

510
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,050
to kind of pivot and do some bad stuff

511
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,450
the interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that just how</font>

512
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,790
some of this stuff is used so here's an

513
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:33,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of something that's really</font>

514
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,470
really recent and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way exercise</font>

515
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,030
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sky better or something like that</font>

516
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,620
but anyway so this was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

517
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,090
bad so then this exercise a lot of you

518
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't wanna rip somebody's contact list</font>

519
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,000
out from there I you know from their

520
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">iPhone and here's an example of</font>

521
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,920
something so on Android you're allowed

522
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,260
to bind basically like it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript</font>

523
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">interface so you can bind you can bind a</font>

524
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,530
you know Java you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java class Java</font>

525
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,480
libraries anything like that the

526
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,360
JavaScript so when it's actually you

527
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,740
know executed and ran in the webview in

528
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,879
theory cross-site scripting right there

529
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,660
so you just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make to do like</font>

530
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,400
window dot s msjs interface that send

531
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,470
SMS and then you know the appropriate

532
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,660
parameters and you fire enough SMS

533
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:16,280
patches at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know it's</font>

534
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,420
interesting cuz you have one issue which

535
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,160
you know needs the different issues

536
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,720
based on like the rich features of the

537
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,280
platform

538
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,440
so the recommendation<font color="#CCCCCC"> air is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ever</font>

539
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,180
tie like<font color="#CCCCCC"> SM has to something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

540
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,400
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript because you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just you're</font>

541
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,410
nuts and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if I</font>

542
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be your friend at that point but I</font>

543
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,140
mean we don't lie<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how to fix these</font>

544
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,900
things it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a matter of just</font>

545
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting people to actually do it so I</font>

546
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,570
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're pulling untrusted data</font>

547
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,160
from somewhere else and you're you know

548
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,510
you're you know populating and are you

549
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,800
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some Jason stuff and you're like</font>

550
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm going to populate or web viewer</font>

551
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,919
stuff like that you know do your same

552
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,020
due diligence I mean you know properly

553
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,080
encode it in the appropriate context etc

554
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,510
etc if you're you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel</font>

555
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,679
anything if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> concatenate in well</font>

556
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,300
you you probably have been paying

557
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention at anything anybody said for</font>

558
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,560
the past you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how many years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

559
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,790
unless police you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just really think</font>

560
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,960
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're tying and you know</font>

561
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,820
this what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into like</font>

562
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,500
another issue where you might not have

563
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,210
control but if you and lease if you have

564
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,920
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the application just really</font>

565
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,140
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what are you tying to some</font>

566
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,140
of these web pieces of functionality

567
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright poor authorization and</font>

568
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,350
authentication you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how</font>

569
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,469
many apps are reviewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> where basically</font>

570
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,570
the app was sending the phone number of

571
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,780
the device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server and that was</font>

572
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication you know I guess there's</font>

573
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,809
a there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of challenges we have</font>

574
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,668
to deal with in the mobile space in that

575
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,370
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the keyboards are much</font>

576
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:45,710
smaller it's harder to enter a username

577
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,299
and a password we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily want</font>

578
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store that information on the device</font>

579
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:51,080
and some people know that others don't

580
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,178
they choose to store that information on

581
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,639
the device to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easier on the</font>

582
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,799
users so what happens is we kind of push

583
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,470
developers towards finding an easier way

584
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,900
and they'll use data such as the phone

585
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,840
number or other unique Device Identifier

586
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:10,460
like imei or udid on on iOS to

587
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,649
authenticate the device to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banking</font>

588
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,080
application to whatever application is

589
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,419
enabling access to sensitive data so the

590
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,540
concept of strong authentication kind of

591
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,140
goes out the window in a lot of in a lot

592
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cases what does that translate to</font>

593
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:30,110
well a small key space these these

594
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,610
identifiers are easily brute forcible

595
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,020
and next thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can iterate</font>

596
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:38,959
through everyone's account in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

597
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:42,410
same thing goes for the authorization

598
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,049
you know I touched on some examples of

599
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:48,080
baking authorization and access control

600
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:49,520
decisions into client-side logic just a

601
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,520
couple weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we're looking at an app</font>

602
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,168
or the server sends down a token that

603
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,230
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your admin and all of a sudden</font>

604
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:58,820
new admin functionality opens up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

605
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,910
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> device and there were no other</font>

606
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,309
server side checks going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to enforce</font>

607
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,200
that so you know you put you push this

608
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,970
client application down to the user it

609
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,950
needs to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the functionality baked in</font>

610
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,480
whatever the higher privileged

611
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,770
functionality is you know you have

612
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">different functionality for different</font>

613
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,120
roles in the app you kind of have to

614
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,678
accept the fact that the user or an

615
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,239
attacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's reversing this app is</font>

616
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,429
going to see it oh there's this hidden

617
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,960
functionality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get to but on the</font>

618
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">backend you need to remember that you</font>

619
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,970
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform the access control their</font>

620
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:31,399
access control doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> end at the client</font>

621
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">it needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be enforced on the server so</font>

622
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,340
they're in you know

623
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,510
many ways in a poorly implemented mobile

624
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,490
application that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can bypass</font>

625
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,190
authentication and assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity</font>

626
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,730
of other users and gain unauthorized

access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in terms of horizontal</font>

628
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,270
privilege escalation as well as vertical

629
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,930
privilege escalation because developers

630
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:53,580
assume in many times and many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

631
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,260
design requirements that the developers

632
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,770
are following aren't clear or direct

633
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:02,940
enough that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this access control can</font>

634
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:07,590
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the client side this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

635
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,660
an example of using a unique Device

636
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,909
Identifier to authenticate the device so

637
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,300
we see that we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking up the</font>

638
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,680
device ID to see if it's permanently

639
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:19,470
authenticated or authorized to use the

640
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:22,680
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the device ID is</font>

641
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,870
whitelisted we give the guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid</font>

need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use strong</font>

authentication strong credentials secret

645
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:37,470
data that is not easily brute forcible

646
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:40,260
or discoverable contextual information

647
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,840
can you know enhance the authentication

648
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,030
experience for a user but really only as

649
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,980
part of a multi-factor implementation I

650
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:50,850
mean you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have multiple factors</font>

651
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:53,010
of off out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of band doesn't necessarily</font>

652
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,340
work if the out-of-band mechanism is on

653
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:59,129
the same device for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes we</font>

654
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,230
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and password is sent</font>

655
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:04,830
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server and then the server sends</font>

656
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:08,250
back a valid session token or some other

sniffing traffic I'm you know at some

660
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,550
point you're probably not going to see

661
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS message go through but if</font>

662
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,700
you've already owned the device and you

663
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,679
can create an event handler that's

664
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,420
looking at all incoming SMS messages

665
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,700
well that rogue application on your

666
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,400
device is going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that SMS so</font>

667
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">out-of-band really needs to be out of</font>

669
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,139
and you know the real important thing is

670
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,850
never used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a device ID or a subscriber</font>

671
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,530
ID as a sole piece of authentication

672
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,580
data you need to have multiple factors

673
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know one other thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

674
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch on before we go to the neck</font>

675
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,619
one is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first slide</font>

676
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,460
that didn't have a relevant news article

677
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:56,218
but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

678
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,109
risks that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's there seems to be</font>

679
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:59,399
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a reputational risk for</font>

680
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,070
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are pushing out</font>

681
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:05,428
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do something really</font>

682
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple such as you know don't turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

683
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:10,049
strict certificate validate validation

684
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:11,399
checking for SS for your SSL connections

685
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,469
and next thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're written</font>

686
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,998
up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street Journal and you</font>

687
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:16,859
know your organization gets a black eye

688
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:18,239
so one of the things that area in Evans

689
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:20,968
was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday was how do</font>

690
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:22,950
we communicate to senior management all

691
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">these problems to help get budget well</font>

692
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,999
it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the in the mobile space</font>

693
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,799
it's much easier to get written up and

694
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:31,229
have that widespread reputational damage

695
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,299
so that's just kind of food<font color="#E5E5E5"> for thought</font>

696
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:35,489
out there you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of how do</font>

697
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,979
you relay<font color="#CCCCCC"> this information up the chain</font>

698
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:40,619
and get resources to do not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile</font>

699
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:44,999
application security but application

700
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:48,330
security in general so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I wanted</font>

701
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:50,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add add to that to that also m5 also</font>

702
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,918
applies to servers authenticating

703
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,529
themselves to the client as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

704
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,909
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the client can actually</font>

705
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,229
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these servers authorized to do</font>

706
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:01,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">an action one of the examples that I</font>

707
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:03,589
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give really quick was an app</font>

708
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:06,749
where it was an endpoint security

709
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:10,710
solution for mobile and it would issue

710
00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:13,139
remote wipe commands over SMS and it

711
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:16,559
took about a very short period<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

712
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:18,658
to figure out that the the actual

713
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,178
Authenticator was the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

714
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,879
concatenated with a static string and

715
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,619
md5 so if you could just figure out what

716
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:27,859
your phone number was or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

717
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:30,509
could knows what this this string<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

718
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:31,710
makes the digest of that sends an SMS to

719
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">your phone with that and the command for</font>

720
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,399
remote wipe your device your device gets

721
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,349
blown away so authenticating the origin

722
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,998
of messages authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> should also</font>

723
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:42,389
an authorization should be built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

724
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:46,320
the client as well so improper session

725
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:47,879
handling so this kind of this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

726
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,178
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to some of the authentication</font>

727
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:52,859
and authorization issues as well

728
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:55,710
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of usability</font>

729
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,449
requirements and because we can't

730
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,060
necessarily guarantee the fidelity of a

731
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,200
connection

732
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:05,710
that a device has people we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

733
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll put a more longer like a token</font>

734
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,420
with a longer lifetime or they'll stat

735
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:12,040
you know they'll store the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tokens</font>

736
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,160
somewhere in securely kind of going back

737
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,370
to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other examples earlier or</font>

738
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,900
they will use homegrown session

739
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:23,439
management or not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> session management</font>

740
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:26,500
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all like Mike was saying so one of</font>

741
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,500
the things that we also see is people

742
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,180
simply using a device ID as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

743
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,890
token and while that session<font color="#CCCCCC"> token never</font>

744
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,150
really expires because it's a device ID

745
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,350
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned before will persist one of</font>

746
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned in here is</font>

747
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">0 auth which I think personally is a</font>

748
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,010
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foolproof</font>

749
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,409
but it does it does definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

750
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:51,850
some of the traditional issues around

751
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,680
mobile mobile session management so some

752
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,810
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know we would</font>

753
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend is expire tokens these are</font>

754
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:01,750
these are web services they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

755
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to actually expire tokens it's</font>

756
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,900
it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks that your user might</font>

757
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,700
have to put in a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and password</font>

758
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,800
again but if your application is

759
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,370
sensitive enough it wouldn't hurt to do

760
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,720
that something like oh ah for instance

761
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,209
does support the ability to actually

762
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,860
remotely revoke tokens or through some

763
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,630
you know typically through a web UI if

764
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,270
any of you have ever used Twitter I'm

765
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,860
sure at least two of you have there's

766
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:27,070
actually an interface where once you've

767
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,959
granted applicati application access to

768
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,260
your account you can actually later

769
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
revoke that that uh that authentication

770
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,160
token that that app will use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to access</font>

771
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,500
your account so having an interface like

772
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:42,850
that to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn that off is also</font>

773
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:44,470
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommended obviously typical</font>

774
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,169
session management session handling

775
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:52,380
things apply here don't use easily

776
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:55,450
guessable or poorly poorly generated

777
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:00,370
session tokens so that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of goes back</font>

778
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,170
to traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> iwasa top 10 stuff all</font>

779
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,510
right next up on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how</font>

780
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,570
that really plays off the most part<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS</font>

781
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:10,780
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android the most security decisions</font>

782
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,260
via untrusted inputs so on iOS you have

783
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,230
the con

784
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,240
the URL scheme so for example it's just

785
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,980
here's quick example just for anyone's

786
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,690
that familiar with it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there you</font>

787
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,180
have an iframe you have skype<font color="#CCCCCC"> coleman</font>

788
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,270
phone number so that's an example so

789
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,770
when when the OS you know it sees that

790
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,330
ok something's call with skype it's

791
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,470
going to fire off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the appropriate</font>

792
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,320
application that that knows how to

793
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,700
handle that so the issue with this in

794
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular was that it would actually</font>

795
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">allow so somebody actually just you know</font>

796
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I framed it like that and it hit the</font>

797
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,580
skype application and the application

798
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,990
didn't say hey user do you really want

799
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make this phone call just let the</font>

800
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,840
phone call<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through that's definitely</font>

801
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">a problem so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a slide so yeah</font>

802
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,439
android something similar mean not going

803
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,240
to get into intense and the whole

804
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,470
permission system and you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

805
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,020
works between components and stuff like

806
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,210
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Android world anyone can</font>

807
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,520
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray out of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pin up Pannell out</font>

808
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,500
of the box any application can start

809
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,610
like an intent you know with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

810
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,070
you don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> permissions around or</font>

811
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,840
not intent on an activity right so

812
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">inactivity is like you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you open</font>

813
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,010
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your application you know you're</font>

814
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at an activity it's a single you</font>

815
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,730
know single thing you basically do so if

816
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,139
you're firing off say for example like

817
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">as soon as that activity files off you</font>

818
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">firing off like saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like an async</font>

819
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">task or something like that that does</font>

820
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really really bad that's not</font>

821
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,129
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if another application would say</font>

822
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,280
start you know delete account or

823
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,930
whatever or make like you know obscene

824
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,340
transfer or something like that not

825
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,670
doing additional things to validate you

826
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,679
know who's calling it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know does the</font>

827
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:44,350
user really accept this that's an issue

828
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,640
so this is really rich on a weekend

829
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,679
again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could spend a lot of time in</font>

830
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,420
this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone like an inter process</font>

831
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,820
type thing application application is a

832
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,740
really rich attack surface for this kind

833
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,840
of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we just hit that so the</font>

834
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,820
recommendation is you know check who's

835
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,520
calling it so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

836
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,710
permissions like and if it's something

837
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,090
sensitive you know go the additional two

838
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,230
or three steps I mean saying the same

839
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,379
thing you do you know on a conventional

840
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,700
web application you know to say for

841
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,050
example like change user settings you

842
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,520
might make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> re-up dedicada some</font>

843
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,620
point that you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> need those</font>

844
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,510
additional you know checks and stops in

845
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,840
place otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just going to set</font>

846
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,370
yourself up for failure

847
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,720
yeah so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hit that that</font>

848
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,879
that's that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i could probably</font>

849
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,010
like really get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> control with but</font>

850
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're we're not so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

851
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:37,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back over to so side channel data</font>

852
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,180
leakage this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

853
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,010
we've seen like trip you know typical

854
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,960
issues around people storing too much

855
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:48,700
client site in web browsers that's kind

856
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,860
of a well-understood science there but

857
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,030
of course as Mike mentioned earlier that

858
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,189

for data leakage obviously web caches

868
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,880
are still a concern on mobile devices

869
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile apps as well there are issues</font>

870
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,170
around keystroke logging for instance in

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">android you can install things like</font>

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:28,720
swype which is an alternative keyboard

873
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,610
there are also spyware apps legit legit

874

spyware apps that will install an

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,040
watch what your teens are doing and what

877
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,770
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> faceboook things they're doing</font>

and entering into SMS messages and

879
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,160
whatnot and that actually sort of log

880
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,510
somewhere of all the keystrokes and also

881
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,520
syncs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else so if an</font>

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:03,730
guys over<font color="#E5E5E5"> at lookout actually did a talk</font>

889
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,230
last year at black hat where they they

890
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,850
in one of their examples they said how

891
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,699
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimum amount of things we</font>

892
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,980
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to successfully exfiltrate data</font>

893
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,529
from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android device so what they did</font>

894
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,110
was one of the examples they gave was

895
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,390
have an appt only request the read logs

896
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,620
permission and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just looked for</font>

897
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,049
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that were hitting the log</font>

898
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:27,489
and then just popping up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web browser</font>

899
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,600
and the HTTP posting or HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> GET to an</font>

900
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,859
end point they controlled with

921
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:22,480
what they do and here's an example of a

922
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:26,200
logging a logging issue in in iOS where

923
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,110
Jack did you this is your example of the

924
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,020
the iOS 10 so in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

925
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,660
what it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually just writing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">out to a to a a warning log the</font>

929
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,430
these logging facilities are pretty easy

930
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,290
to access from a seemingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font>

931
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,410
app and would otherwise be really easy

932
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:49,779
to pull sensitive information out so

933
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:52,180
don't log credentials don't log P<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

934
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,790
don't log in some cases I've seen

935
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,980
developers actually log though otherwise

936
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,380
obscure their code really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and use</font>

937
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,270
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> proguard which is reversible</font>

938
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,190
but still is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just upping the ante but</font>

939
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,960
then in the log messages they'll show

940
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,400
exactly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> their HTTP requests are</font>

941
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,870
constructed so then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

942
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,090
information you can easily attack the

00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:15,160
back end if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are on iOS disable</font>

944
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:17,140
screenshots for your app or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

945
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,520
store information that or put

<font color="#E5E5E5">information that would otherwise be</font>

947
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,780
included in a screenshot when the user

00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,180
hits the home screen remove any

949
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,650

into your into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your app before you</font>

951
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,000
release it to production so a lot of

00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,580
typical kind of you know best practices

953

around software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:45,990
really hard

00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:48,650
I don't know if anybody follows any of

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL stuff going on but you know even</font>

money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend on doing it right can't</font>

960
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:57,480
seem to do it right so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all</font>

961
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,149
trickles down to mobile app developers

962
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,880
is al crypto is hard there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

963
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,619
opportunities for failure and the two

964
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,079
primary categories for failure you know

965
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,859
much like in the web application world

966
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,890
are either using broken implementations

967
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:17,279
or implementing known algorithms

968
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:19,529
improperly or just deciding to roll your

00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:24,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">own crypto and create something that's</font>

970
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:27,089
in many cases trivially defeated other

971
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:28,829
common mistakes encoding does not equal

972
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:30,690
encryption there's still people out

973
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:33,200
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Bay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 encoding is</font>

974
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:36,420
encryption that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the case</font>

975
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,279
obfuscation is not encryption just

976
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,910
swapping bytes and mixing things up

977
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:43,170
that's going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> figured out and</font>

978
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:47,098
serialization does not equal encryption

979
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:50,309
just putting something into you know not

980
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:52,200
as easily decipherable data format is

981
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,319
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to protect your data from</font>

somebody who has a vested interest in

983
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,240
accessing it and when we're talking

984
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:03,089
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of</font>

985
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,069

00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,470
algorithm you need to remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

987
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:09,420
many of these platforms it's somewhat

988
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,129
trivial once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the application in</font>

989
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,750
hand because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you downloaded it from the</font>

990
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,180
marketplace or from your organization's

991
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:17,400
website that it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

992
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:21,899
to either bytecode or in some cases

993
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:26,309
source code and actually reverse the

994
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,890
logic that's baked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app you know</font>

995
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,509
I've seen many examples of this this one

996
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,029
was kind of interesting so this was

997
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:35,789
actually a blackberry application that

998
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:38,730
was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically sync images</font>

999
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:40,799
and other data up into the cloud but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1000
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,660
developers they actually had to write

1001
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:45,359
this application to work on like version

1002
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">4 of the blackberry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API and version 5</font>

1003
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:52,589
and one of the you know for dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 stop</font>

1004
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:55,890
whatever actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a bug in the SSL</font>

1005
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:57,869
API like I said crypto is hard

1006
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:59,940
this is in rim code this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

1007
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:02,130
something that the developer a bug that

1008
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,490
the developer introduced he had to work

1009
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:08,549
around an implementation flaw in in the

1010
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:12,629
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the actual bug in the</font>

1011
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:15,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">platform was that in a post over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> https</font>

1012
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,240
over a certain number of bytes would

1013
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:20,760
just fail with with for no reason

1014
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,109
seemingly so what they realized was that

1015
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay they knew they needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

1016
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:27,569
this data some house so they decided to

1017
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement an asymmetric crypto</font>

1018
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:33,058
implementation using Triple DES but what

1019
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:35,819
they did was they<font color="#CCCCCC"> put in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard coded</font>

1020
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:39,119
static key that would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the same</font>

1021
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:41,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">on any installation of the application</font>

1022
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,650
so if a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> people downloaded this</font>

1023
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:47,400
app and we're uploading data on this

1024
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,930
version of blackberry then all that data

1025
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,789
traversing the wire would be easily

1026
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,000
recoverable because the key was easily

1027
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:56,250
recoverable from from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java bytecode</font>

1028
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,069
which was you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java bytecode from</font>

1029
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:02,490
a rim Cod file using a utility named

1030
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:03,538
codec which is somewhat flaky sometimes

1031
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,508
it works sometimes it doesn't

1032
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,609
fortunately it worked here so that this

1033
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:10,259
example just goes back to show you you

1034
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">really need to understand the</font>

1035
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:17,130
limitations of the platform the platform

1036
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:19,529
developers make mistakes too so how did

1037
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:22,109
we how did we fix this it was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1038
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:25,589
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really I told them they</font>

1039
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use asymmetric cryptography</font>

1040
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:30,269
were you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could still use the</font>

1041
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,730
server's public key to encrypt this data

1042
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:34,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">and send it up over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire for</font>

1043
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever reason they didn't decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1044
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,410
that route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they actually wrote a</font>

1045
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,660
whole new web service that the

1046
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:42,269
application could pull to retrieve a new

1047
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,700
symmetric key and the funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was at</font>

1048
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:47,160
first that symmetric key was also static

1049
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,500
so everybody was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting the same</font>

1050
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,089
key so then they built a whole new you

1051
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,519
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of additional server-side</font>

1052
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:56,400
functionality to map the new symmetric

1053
00:40:53,519 --> 00:41:01,008
key to the session so again I mean it's

1054
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,509
better I guess but still overly complex

1055
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:05,910
interestingly enough recently I've been

1056
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:08,250
looking at another<font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at a</font>

1057
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,480
blackberry application in a windows

1058
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:12,119
phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7</font>

1059
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,700
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same application and the</font>

1060
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,770
blackberry application they were using

1061
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">keys generated on the device not</font>

1062
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:22,140
necessarily using Java secure random

1063
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,379
they needed to encrypt data so they were

1064
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,230
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the other</font>

1065
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:31,500
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flagged them for the default</font>

1066
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,109
what is it in on rim it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES</font>

1067
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,630
encrypter engine by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default uses</font>

1068
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:38,970
electronic code book ECB mode for

1069
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,850
encryption which you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

1070
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:44,250
the Wikipedia article and they the

1071
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:46,618
example they use is an encrypted image

1072
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,540
of the linux penguin and you still

1073
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:51,109
clearly see the linux penguin because

1074
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:53,430
there's no interference you know

1075
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,680
introduced into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual encryption</font>

1076
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,569
process so that's so really that's the

1077
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,118
math stuff that I'm not qualified to

1078
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:03,180
talk about but it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very easily</font>

1079
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,100
just implemented CBC mode cipher block

1080
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,080
chaining and using initialization

1081
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,880
vectors which they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to do</font>

1082
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:14,009
that funny thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> was on the Windows</font>

1083
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,720
Phone 7 app by default and I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1084
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:18,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">research just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking into that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1085
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,629
all the code examples used CBC mode used

1086
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I ve used a stronger mode of encryption</font>

1087
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:27,240
so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two versions of the</font>

00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows phone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 was a little bit better</font>

1090
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,710
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box that developer had in my</font>

1091
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,440
opinion they had a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance of</font>

1092
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:42,390
success just based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the platform and</font>

1093
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:46,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the resources available so some</font>

1094
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:48,810
prevention tips again don't roll your

1095
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,070
own crypto crypto is hard that's

1096
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:54,180
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been harping on for</font>

1097
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:58,800
years don't necessarily store the key

1098
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:02,279
with the encrypted data you need to

1099
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,109
utilize the the secure storage

1100
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,210
mechanisms of the platform so Windows

1101
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:13,190
Phone 7 there's isolated data storage

1102
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:16,109
there is the name escapes me of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1103
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,869
rim version of isolated data storage but

1104
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:20,970
there's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use code signing to</font>

1105
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:22,980
actually restrict access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a data store</font>

1106
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,600
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that application</font>

1107
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,810
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more complicated than</font>

1108
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,980
on the Windows Phone 7 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you</font>

1109
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:35,549
want to make the key hard to get to from

1110
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">a rogue application so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if the</font>

1111
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,760
device falls into the hands of an

1112
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,890
attacker the application falls into the

1113
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,050
hands of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual person he's going to</font>

1114
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:45,029
get at the key but what we can prevent

1115
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:47,160
using the appropriate data storage

1116
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:49,230
mechanisms of your platform is a rogue

1117
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,868
application from being installed on the

1118
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:54,480
device and just being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access the</font>

1119
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:55,770
encrypted data and access the key so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1120
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,130
need to protect the key from

1121
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,660
programmatic attacks and again you know

1122
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,430
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take advantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1123
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform's already provide need to</font>

1124
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:09,480
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our developers understand</font>

1125
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:12,600
what the platform provides so nice stuff

1126
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,880
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 so for this one we distinguish</font>

1127
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,618
between what's stored on the devices as

1128
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,030
in secured storage self it's stored to

1129
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,160
the file system external to the

1130
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,070
application then that's in secure

1131
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,420
storage if it's hard coded into the app

1132
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,980
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> binary and compiled on all the</font>

1133
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,619
good stuff then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> grouping that</font>

1134
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,450
under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 some platforms it's</font>

1135
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reverse a nap</font>

1136
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,069
you know back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know actual code</font>

1137
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,960
than others but at the same time you

1138
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,100
know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end it's you know it's very</font>

1139
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,540
similar something stuff you see to what

1140
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,609
you know happened when people started

1141
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,619
pushing more logic down to the browser

1142
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:45,630
so the whole web 20 age action or

1143
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoop-dee-doo thing happened and people</font>

1144
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,560
just in almost a sense of good judgment

1145
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,850
they said oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just push</font>

1146
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,799
down in the browser cares you know it's

1147
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">not visible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the user it's you know</font>

1148
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,850
it's in a hidden form field so what can

1149
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,529
go wrong right so very similar I mean

1150
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:00,890
you'd be amazed<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the crap that people</font>

1151
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,510
were just like putting into their apps

1152
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:07,109
you know like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems a little</font>

1153
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:09,060
ridiculous but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really not um this</font>

1154
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:10,680
kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like oh hey don't</font>

1155
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,299
worry it's any app and no one's going to

1156
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to it I mean anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a</font>

1157
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,700
browser-based application I mean if

1158
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,530
you're giving it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the client if you're</font>

1159
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,899
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a desktop it means in the end</font>

1160
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,720
it's a piece of software if someone has

1161
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,010
it in their possession eventually

1162
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,919
they're going to get what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want out</font>

1163
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,690
of it the recommendation it should

1164
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,630
actually put like number one just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1165
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,130
common sense use your brain if it's

1166
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,940
really sensitive to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business from</font>

1167
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,589
whether it's

1168
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:37,829
you know say I'm an intellectual

1169
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:39,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">property perspective or from a security</font>

1170
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:40,980
perspective so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're you know</font>

1171
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting courage you're putting you know</font>

1172
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,700
sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> end points that you know might</font>

1173
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:46,980
take like 20 years to you know brute

1174
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:50,848
force enumerate and stuff like that you

1175
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,980
messed up recommendation keep it out of

1176
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:57,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application if it's not necessary it</font>

1177
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:58,290
doesn't belong in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the binary so with</font>

1178
00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:01,680
that said we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four minutes</font>

1179
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,119
left so a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick wrap-up so yeah</font>

1180
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,890
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it open for about 60</font>

1181
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">days if there's anything you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't agree</font>

1182
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,790
with in there um come talk to us I'm in

1183
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:11,220
the next phase we're going to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1184
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,290
more we got some metrics I mean we got a

1185
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">good amount of feedback but we really</font>

1186
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for people that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1187
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,509
a lot of assessments and seeing a lot

1188
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:20,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are internal dev</font>

1189
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:23,250
shops that are you know seeing you know

1190
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,050
here's issues and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> across our</font>

1191
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,130
portfolio applications really interested

1192
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,540
to just kind of share data across

1193
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,579
different interesting verticals and

1194
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,859
stuff like that as well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1195
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:33,329
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's going to have maybe it's</font>

1196
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:35,940
not but to go with like a 12-month

1197
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">release cycle for this the interesting</font>

1198
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,240
thing is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how fast</font>

1199
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">these platforms are moving along you</font>

1200
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,390
know new things I mean that we haven't

1201
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">seen you know NFC and that could be the</font>

1202
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,839
next big boom and people just going to

1203
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:48,029
lose that their brains again when they

1204
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,259
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out NFC apps so we want to</font>

1205
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,270
try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep it as current as possible</font>

1206
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,490
just so people working with data that's

1207
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:57,329
actually relevant for the current

1208
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:59,160
platforms so<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion so I mean we've</font>

1209
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:01,470
we've started to identify these issues

1210
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,790
but the next set of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do</font>

1211
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,200
so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to start getting into</font>

1212
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,089
intervals individual platforms

1213
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,339
themselves I'm really drilling down some

1214
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:10,290
really good practices this been talked

1215
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:15,029
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing they don't like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sappy for</font>

1216
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android a sappy for objective-c iOS so I</font>

1217
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,550
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are good things I mean the</font>

1218
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,869
more ultimately the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools we</font>

1219
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,089
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the hands of developers in</font>

1220
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:24,359
theory you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they'll start building</font>

1221
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:28,220
better applications so with that said

1222
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:28,220
that's all we have thank you

1223
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:30,609
you
