00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,529
my name is Annie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Myrna and I worked for</font>

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:08,709
deloitte<font color="#CCCCCC"> matus and the Enterprise Risk</font>

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:11,620
Services and I do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work in</font>

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:14,230
software assurance and I do some cloud

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,810
virtualization work and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,700
to do today is considering time

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,919
constraints we're going to do an

8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,289
overview a rapid overview of

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,789
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cloud and then we're</font>

10
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:28,150
going to walk through a sample

11
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:31,420
application the first half of the talk

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,619
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more informational than some of</font>

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,899
you may zone out because you already

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,729
know it others<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good baseline</font>

15
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:40,449
just want to make sure we have a common

16
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:42,309
vocabulary and then the second half I

17
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:44,260
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing and ask</font>

18
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,769
you lots and lots of questions for you

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,510
to take back to your organization's so

20
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:51,429
and I also assume everybody can read

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,839
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to me talk so I'm not</font>

22
00:00:51,429 --> 00:01:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to read anything to you the bottom</font>

23
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:04,628
point is one of the most critical in

24
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:07,179
cloud and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization the boundary</font>

25
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:10,510
is where what we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of you</font>

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,410
had a DMZ if you had an application you

27
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:16,420
needed port 135 open for your

28
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,580
application to work right well then you

29
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,090
would mitigate that by making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the</font>

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,560
firewall had port 135 clothes well now

31
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,690
the boundary is not the edge of your

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,100
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the boundary is the edge of</font>

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">your host your virtual machine your 0 X</font>

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,750
so the boundary that you need to defend

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,750
is much closer than what it used to be

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,750
virtualization is not equal to cloud

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,960
virtualization is an enabling technology

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:51,130
cloud is a service delivery model they

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,770
are not the same virtualization enables

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,690
cloud but is not the pent cloud is not

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,330
dependent on virtualization

42
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,380
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization in the next</font>

43
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,240
couple of minutes we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to punch</font>

44
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,039
through some baseline information on

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,880
virtualization and cloud like I talked

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,690
about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can virtualize a lot of things</font>

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,760
most of us are familiar with

48
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,290
virtualizing your applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,959
ears OS your compute cycles those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,910
of things or servers there's also server

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,360
storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization we see that in</font>

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sands a lot of times where you'll have a</font>

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,620
sand in the back end does all your

54
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,350
storage in some implementations of

55
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,980
virtualized environments there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

56

OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual machine</font>

59
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,130
someplace so you can bring up multiple

60
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,829
instances of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an OS or an application</font>

61
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,650
stack by reaching back into the sand and

62
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:56,780
pulling onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hard on to the hardware</font>

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it runs they are mostly in memory</font>

storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization as I like to say</font>

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,630
it's kind of like my waistline after<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40</font>

66
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,739
it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tendency to expand and never</font>

67
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,480
retract application virtualization when

68
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,280
we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take an application we</font>

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,929
virtualize it across a number of hosts

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,660
number of different pieces of hardware

71
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,830
and software and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

72
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,320
couple of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

your desktop is back in the cloud

someplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's back at the server room</font>

79
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,800
and you're out on a thin client or

you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop your home computer</font>

82

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,700
desktop virtualization is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big thing</font>

84
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to start seeing that on</font>

85
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,810
a lot of mobile devices ipads and other

86
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,650
tablet type of devices there's a couple

87
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,140
of different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing</font>

88
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,120
virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and virtualization</font>

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,820
started back in the 60s with IBM on

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,660
mainframes and its continued through and

91
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's evolving right now most of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cpus</font>

92
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,930
from the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors support native</font>

93
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,339
virtualization light on the chips<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

94
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">also have the old older stuff where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CHCH</font>

95
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:24,299
root on unix boxes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> sons</font>

96
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:28,550
containers and zones those kind of

97
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,990
things are at the OS level and then

98
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,690
there's a minor but important

99
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,860
distinction full virtualization that's

100
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,540
where you're running native the

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization machine is running right</font>

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:44,040
on the bare hardware and it completely

103
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,888
emulates the hardware in the OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware</font>

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,810
does that the power of virtualization is

105
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,880
where most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff is done not one</font>

106
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,580
hundred percent may use api's to do the

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest of the interfacing there and that's</font>

108
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,270
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux and Citrix do with their</font>

109
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:05,780
zen and the IBM lcars does the same sort

110
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:10,080
of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so the hypervisor is</font>

111
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,719
the software that interfaces between the

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,260
hardware and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operating systems and</font>

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,910
there's two types of hypervisors there's

114
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,680
the type 1 hypervisor where the

115
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,810
hypervisor runs right on bare metal and

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,780
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like VMware that we're</font>

117
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,770
used to ESX where you'll go in and the

118
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,469
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you do when you get your</font>

119
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,780
hardware is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go install</font>

120
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,169
the hypervisor on the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

121
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,429
install OS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on top of it a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

122
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:40,409
hypervisor is more like the free

123
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:45,360
versions of VMware that you can run on

124
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">your desktop or the Sun VirtualBox where</font>

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,630
you have a baseline OS then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> install</font>

126
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Virtual Machine Manager on there and</font>

127
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you install a guest OS so you have</font>

128
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,388
a windows laptop you install<font color="#E5E5E5"> VirtualBox</font>

129
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,970
then you can install Linux and run Linux

130
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,360
inside but you have to start windows

131
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,360
first

132
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:10,509
so that concludes my very rapid

133
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,280
discussion of virtualization the slides

134
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:16,479
will be available so that you can read

135
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,770
them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail online so cloud</font>

136
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,900
computing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said is a service model</font>

137
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:27,219
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has five essential characteristics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

138
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,289
design as defined by<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST rapid</font>

139
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:33,400
elasticity is one of the things that's

140
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:37,530
really critical to developers the reason

141
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:42,969
is you never know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where new</font>

142

144
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,190
systems are they can physically be in

worried about the network

when you go out you do

230
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:33,039
platform-as-a-service you can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon and you can get you can have a</font>

stand up the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a linux box</font>

running my sequel or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows system</font>

234
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,269
with Microsoft sequel server so you're

235
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,758
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application and</font>

236
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:52,029
above<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Amazon is responsible for the</font>

237
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,139
OS and bolo on your stack and the same

238
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,489
when you go out and you do

239
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,199
infrastructure-as-a-service you're

240
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:58,929
basically getting the hardware level<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

241
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:01,689
you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the OS and are</font>

242
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:05,978
so there's different levels at which you

243
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:10,118
need to negotiate with the cloud service

244
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:12,339
provider who owns what who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible</font>

245
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:17,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">for what and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you run</font>

246
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:19,149
into is where there's a gap between what

247
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:20,979
they're going to do with the the

248
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,829
provider it says they're going to do and

249
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:26,919
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you're going to do that gap</font>

250
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,779
by default is your ownership so somebody

251
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:32,559
doesn't figure out who's patching what

252
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,329
and something goes on patched by default

253
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,429
it's your problem not the service

254
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,258
providers it's very important that as

255
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,639
you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you work with service</font>

organization or an external organization

258
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:48,489
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you figure out who</font>

259
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:52,079
owns what and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do so</font>

260
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:52,079
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the risks that we've got</font>

261
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:57,939

you can you trust it and then under

00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:18,968
operations there have got logging and

268
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:20,829
monitoring you need to figure out as

269
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:22,749
you're developing the applications the

270
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:25,029
level of logging and monitoring so that

271
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:27,649
you can do audit non-repudiation and

272
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,379
have a forensic trail back

273
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,029
and oh by the way you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

people can have an easier time entering

are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pen test and do</font>

vulnerability assessments on your

environment you're going to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

370
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,220
because a test environment that doesn't

locate real world is not near as

372

effective ok so we punched through that

373
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,029
now on to the meat of this that now I

374
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,130
stop telling you things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start asking</font>

you even more questions for you to

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,180
consider all of these things are

377
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,639
relevant within your environment for

378
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,880
your application stats for your

379
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,680

where you've got old applications

some decisions and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times in</font>

433
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,560
organizations we move we kind of skip

434
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,850
plan leap into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second half of design</font>

435
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,409
and start coding and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really</font>

436
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,740
answer the questions because how many

437
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">times how much time do we spend as</font>

438
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:05,120
developers going back and asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

439
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,070
know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build this house how</font>

440
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,050
many stories is it going to be what's

441
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,899
the neighborhood is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> sewerage you</font>

442
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,340
know or do I need to do septic we ask a

443
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of questions and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times we</font>

444
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,010
try to retrofit things and I know I'm

445
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,629
preaching to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choir on that one but</font>

446
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,280
we need to start asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> these questions</font>

447
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,680
up front what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidentiality</font>

448
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,290
integrity and availability sensitivity

449
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,210
of it if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with Department</font>

450
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,860

451
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,270
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission assurance category</font>

452
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,889
and things like that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dealing</font>

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">with NSA they're going to tell you the</font>

protection levels that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need within</font>

commercial vendors or for internal use

456
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,179
you need to figure that one out because

457
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pr website doesn't need the same</font>

460
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,300
these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

461
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,060
want to be asking at the design stage

462
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:06,379
identity and access management is

463
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:08,570
critical if you're doing a hybrid or

464
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,570
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an external a vendor hosted</font>

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time figuring</font>

467
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,970
that one out<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just by</font>

468
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:22,610
dannion access for you it's for the

469
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,110
clients it's for the cloud provider what

470
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,479
what if anything are you going to let

471
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,370
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what are the what do they own</font>

who's managing the hypervisor who's

managing the OS who's managing the

476
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">your segregation of duties and then</font>

479
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,758
with what

480
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,918
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the policies and procedures</font>

481

for cloud are not equal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font>

482
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,879
exactly the same as for other

483
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:54,428
environments so there's a policy

484
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:59,799
procedure and governance level that

485
00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:02,169
needs to be world ahead of time there's

486
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,940
also the contracting piece which we

487
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,369
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get into but you've got</font>

488
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,279
legal and regulatory requirements for

489
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:10,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">two different jurisdictions and if you</font>

00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:27,248
have anything over in the UK they may

496
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,639
well go and shift it over there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

497
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:32,589
won't know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a consideration you</font>

498
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:34,889
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take into account before you</font>

499
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,889
storm

500
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:45,870
encryption I've touched on it a couple

501
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:47,520
times each we've seen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Microsoft</font>

502
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,739
sequel server comes with its own little

503
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,310
encryption thing where every time you

504
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,840
start it up it sets itself a new key

505
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:57,870
well this out really work in an

506
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,350
environment such as the cloud where you

507
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:03,179
may be bringing systems up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

508
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,429
throughout the day or over a period of

509
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,990
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's starts and</font>

510
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,900
stops you've got to go and manage keys

511
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,900
again part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is hands off so</font>

512
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,710
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how our end</font>

513
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,010
point systems system the system

514
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:23,550
identification and validation of who's

515
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,920
who going to work and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be two</font>

516
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:29,340
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't just throw it out there</font>

517
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Joe and then the other</font>

518
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,600
server goes oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Joe and start</font>

519
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,400
processing stuff Joe has to be

520
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,070
authenticated that you have to

521
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,600
authenticate back the job make sure the

522
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">server's talk to each other and they</font>

523
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,169
know who it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and how are you going to</font>

524
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,690
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when because the clouds elastic</font>

525
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:51,210
you go from two servers to five servers

526
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,070
the two servers again how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

527
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,720
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you lost connectivity to one</font>

528
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,120
of those new servers that was

529
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,680
intentional and not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got</font>

530
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:05,850
knocked offline for some reason and then

531
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,480
your end-to-end encryption you don't

532
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:12,389
know where two systems are going to be

533
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:16,500
who do you trust to look at your data me

534
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,330
I trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one you crypt your stuff at</font>

535
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,610
home on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wireless link at home why</font>

536
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't you encrypt the stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out in</font>

537
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,929
the cloud when you got client data or

538
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,580
company data on it so that end-to-end

539
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,340
encryption and you need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

540
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:33,240
what's what's enough encryption for

541
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,280
protecting your tunnel rot13 is an

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer it's one level of encryption you</font>

543
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,120
can do it may work for what you've got

544

<font color="#CCCCCC">it may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want a s 256 or</font>

more don't know

547
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:52,379
you have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the threats</font>

548
00:24:48,899 --> 00:25:00,139
are and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help drive your</font>

549
00:24:52,379 --> 00:25:03,178
decisions on the other areas what

550
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:08,359
happened what type of news groups and

551
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:10,320
news feeds do developers typically read

552
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,070
typically it's going to be stuff around

553
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,499
how to do this nifty new algorithm

554
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:18,090
what's the latest cartoon things like

555
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:21,239
that Dilbert why everybody reads the

556
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">builders right pretty much but they're</font>

that that language that they're using

<font color="#E5E5E5">has a new hole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in it they're probably</font>

not looking at if they're developing in

566
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,029
PHP they're probably not looking at the

567
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,379
PHP security list because they they

568
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:54,929
don't think it matters<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them they</font>

up the this comes back to we not

and nothing else in between there are

640
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:33,220
organizations where the developers

641
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:35,890
desktop is the dev environment and the

00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:44,080
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets promoted from the</font>

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,220
that that way and we've got a lot of

647
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:49,929
tools and there's going to be some talks

on tools out there for static and

649

652
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,100
integrated throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle so</font>

653
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,450
the developer knew when they screwed up

654
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had to go back and fix</font>

655
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,190
something before it got into production

or into the collaborative environment

657

00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:02,169
that's basic what is different about the

671
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,540
cloud is we used to trust the

672

interchange of information between two

673
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,610
systems because we figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had a</font>

were in their own little trust zone and

676
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,400
we could trust whatever happened across

the network and we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and</font>

695

platform as a service and the vendor

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,110
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> would each with a key so there</font>

720
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,940
isn't an accidental or deliberate launch

721
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:29,080
of an ICBM which would be a bad thing

722
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:32,530
pki in some organizations to give you a

723
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">pki certificate there are 12 people</font>

724
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,550
involved none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which deal with each</font>

725
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,460
other

726
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:41,649
they are not directly they know they

727
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,260
probably know who each other are but

728
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,900
there's 12 people involved each of which

729
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,460
does one specific action and hands it

730
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,730
off to another person which does a

731
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,860
specific action and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

732
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,490
segregation of duties do you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

733
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:00,100
have that level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but what</font>

734
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do need to do is make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

735
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,620
don't have the person managing the

736
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:09,580
virtual machine managing your OS and

737
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,250
managing your database and oh the

738
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,469
developers and I have seen this

739
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,389
developers who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the</font>

740
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,100
database directly so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there's a</font>

741
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:20,199
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database they can go fix</font>

742
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:24,040
it manually you know they get the right

743
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:26,560
as special sequel kind of come in and go

744
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,409
in and fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from fifty dollars to</font>

745
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,969
five hundred dollars oh and yes that's

746
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,750
outside the audit trail so how do you

747
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that that's right when I was an ATT</font>

748
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,770
we used to do fraud it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> entertaining</font>

749
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:41,139
to see what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get away</font>

750
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">with giving each other you know bonus</font>

751
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,370
points and stuff how you've got to work

752
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,900
with those segregation of duties to not

753
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:50,080
allow people to do those kind of things

754
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:54,429
and where you have to have an audit

755
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trail available within regulatory and</font>

756
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:03,610
legal requirements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have key</font>

757
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:06,660
takeaways most of this stuff is the same

758
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,010
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same sort of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font>

759
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,549
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a right it's the same sort of</font>

760
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:16,260
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most not</font>

761
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:18,700
everything the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest things are</font>

762
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,830
there's no more boundary the boundary is

763
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,609
now the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your host and there</font>

764
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:26,860
might be 15 other operating systems up

765
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:29,800
their hosting 15 other different clients

766
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:31,030
for the cloud provider that you can't

767
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust any of them and you can't</font>

768
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,020
necessarily trust the cloud provider

769
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,520
because cloud providers make

770
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,130
configuration mistakes and have

771
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,500
malicious people in there too so you

772
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,530
have to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is by</font>

773
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:48,330
default<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's your responsibility to make</font>

774
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,330
sure this stuff is secure

775
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:54,569
elasticity is a in the past we knew how

776
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:59,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">many systems were going to be running</font>

777
00:35:54,569 --> 00:36:00,490
now we don't we can't necessarily say

778
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,289
we're only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have this many</font>

779
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,899
systems running now we have to

780
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that things come and go and</font>

781
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:13,779
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't control them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that is my</font>

782
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:16,450
very fast blast throw a two hour session

783
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:23,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like to thank everyone for coming out</font>

784
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:27,118
and I hope it was educational and the

785
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,118
slides will be available online
