1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:07,008
I'm Shankar a prelude and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for</font>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,360
cisco systems I'm here today to share

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:14,480
the work we have done in the past top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,150
cloud security project it's a

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,960
collaborative effort primarily among

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,390
three of us all of us work for cisco you

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,490
know all our IT architects working in

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,720
different departments within<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,020
supporting different functional group

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,260
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> bansal is full-time security</font>

11
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,960
architect and myself myself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pankaj</font>

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,180
or IT architects supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,640
different functional groups but security

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not our primary responsibilities at</font>

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,870
least not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last in a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,000
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be primarily on security</font>

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:53,180
before that so today's agenda is spend

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,860
little bit of time on about the project

19
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,480
to know how it started<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what is the</font>

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,719
motivation and the approach we took to

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,760
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a list of top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 sacred</font>

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,089
race I which is on the similar lines of

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,649
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 vulnerabilities of ever became</font>

24
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,908
which is prob probably the most one of

25
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:14,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ovis projects and why is</font>

26
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,719
that important for us what makes us to

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,579
to think about cloud computing as an

28
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,428
important to spend time to analyze the

29
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:26,389
risks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know probably risk</font>

30
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:28,069
mitigations<font color="#CCCCCC"> therein and some the core of</font>

31
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:30,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation is around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth</font>

32
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:32,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth bullets but i am not going to</font>

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,619
go through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first all the risks and</font>

34
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,389
then the risk mitigation for any going

35
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,159
to go the risk and mitigation risk and

36
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:39,740
mitigation kind of a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,329
pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll have some time towards</font>

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:47,719
the end maybe 5-10 minutes for Q&A yes

39
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:49,490
with that so as I said um you know we

40
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,288
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> as as a special interest</font>

41
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,609
interest group on the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> computing</font>

42
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:58,009
and we have we worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our previous</font>

43
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,869
jobs or to review the security of

44
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:02,869
application service providers now you

45
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,969
could call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as cloud providers you</font>

46
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,080
know depending on where as a service

47
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,039
software service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,980
service based on that now experience and

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,720
based on the interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to</font>

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,280
understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the new risks that</font>

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,130
the cloud providers come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with the</font>

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,960
cloud technologies and that option we

53
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,960
want to develop and maintain the claw

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,580
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 initially with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Siskind</font>

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,860
then we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that okay we could use</font>

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:35,310
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a reusable document in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,500
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we approached wasp who</font>

58
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,800
readily gave us the access to create a

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,840
project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on that and not only</font>

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to come up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lists of risks that</font>

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,000
we think that they are but also

62
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,930
potential gaya provide guidelines for

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,980
potential mitigations for those discs

64
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:59,070
yeah so the approach we took is we read

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,720
lot of research articles on cloud

66
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,989
security and market research and

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,270
academic research you know we referred

68
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">on s square articles nest cloud security</font>

69
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,100
alliance guidelines and all all the

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,540
relevant information that we could think

71
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,359
of and we applaud or one condition

72
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,000
knowledge around reviewing applications

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,910
of his providers to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,500
list and also to prioritize and order

75
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,000
the risks are 12 are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 we used some of</font>

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the elements like what is the most</font>

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,760
damaging thing that would happen or what

78
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,140
is the most frequent in its incidents

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,480
that we heard in the industry would I am

80
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,940
NOT going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the incidences</font>

81
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,950
of the cloud providers in this in this

82
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,230
session even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does most of them</font>

83
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,518
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> public information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the probably</font>

84
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,530
there is only one slide which which

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:56,459
refers to some incidences so why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

86
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,489
important the according to gartner cloud

87
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,940
computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the top strategic</font>

88
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:08,250
technology in 2010 I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still in</font>

89
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:11,700
2011 and beyond as per their projections

90
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,780
last year said that global expenditure

91
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,070
on adoption of cloud based solutions

92
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,589
services make up 150 billion dollars

93
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,409
actually last month I was reading the

94
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:27,429
report from<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIO on cyborg of which is</font>

than investing in annotation data center

and and the promises of the cloud

there are many benefits and these

136
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,210
probably one of them it is a slide which

137
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,250
i am using

138
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,799
from I won't PhD dissertation which I

139
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,160
did last year which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very simplified</font>

140
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,139
than what it used to look like I wanted

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find the correlation with among the</font>

of the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> computing products services</font>

152

respectability organizations in fact

are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many elements within the cottage</font>

means the cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> adoption but for</font>

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:16,460
simplicity<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons i simplified so this</font>

159
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,280
is another slide from the results from

160
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,380
IDC again well there are so many

161
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,039
benefits so why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talking about</font>

162
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,860
cloud risks here so the number one

163
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,849
reason why of the number one challenger

164
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,229
reason why people are not even

165
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,849
conditioning so for some organizations

166
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:37,849
is a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the next one is</font>

167
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:40,729
availability you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody else CIA</font>

168
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:43,240
or the three pillars of confidentiality

169
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:46,039
integrity and availability of the three

170
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,500
pillars of security so that the top two

171
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,659
reasons in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> die in this picture and</font>

172
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">for our practical purposes number one</font>

173
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:56,330
security so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core that's a</font>

174
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,190
good segue to get into why we are taught

175
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,750
why we are trying connection what are

176
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,669
the cloud risk and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can possibly</font>

177
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,849
mitigate it though the idea is not to

178
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:07,909
disgrace right I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody</font>

179
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:11,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">will listen to even if it is courage but</font>

180
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:14,360
because the promises of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and</font>

181
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,490
faster times of capability first

182
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,830
positioning will is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely driving</font>

183
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:23,070
from enterprises small medium

184
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:26,609
a large companies to adopt cloud cloud

185
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:29,490
technologies but the idea here is ok you

186
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,400
can you can adopt but<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

the cloud so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start or 12 art</font>

194
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:56,819
and so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer to the cloud</font>

even the security they promised enhance

the security of the of the cloud

223
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,200
services by for example use IPSec

connections between the provider and the

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,740
consumer even the provider doesn't

226
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,190
provide that right off the bat but

227
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon for example the they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

broker to deploy in your data center to

00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,490
broke there are like independent cloud

234
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,589
broker companies just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kenya's back</font>

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,400
there is two parts object the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian</font>

236
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,180
brokers whose purpose to broker the

object server and the object client

238
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,020
cloud broker is there are many companies

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are working on that the cloud</font>

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,240
auditor is as an independent

241
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,560
organization who probably does mostly

just security righty they may be

00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,310
assessing the performance of the cloud

249
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,719
so just for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the completion completeness</font>

250
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,069
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation right so I just want</font>

251
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">to touch upon some of the service models</font>

252
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,800
and deployment models that NIST

253
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,780
recognizes you probably might have heard

254
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,000
about a fourth service model which is

255
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,680
data center as a service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,990
basically dividing that infrastructure

257
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,920
service model into further into two

258
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:40,480
different models where different players

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,829
can operate as you know some data center

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,650
service but that's still not<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognized</font>

261
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,340
industry so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on what</font>

262
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,920
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is already published by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nest so</font>

263
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:54,330
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I gave examples of SAS</font>

264
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,550
salesforce.com prob is one of the famous

265
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,550
SAS provides for enterprises gmail and

266
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,839
so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that furnace service</font>

267
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,900
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the least mature</font>

268
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,480
model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this three SAS probably the</font>

00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,000
most material model infrastructure

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,740

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,740
not many players in infrastructure

272
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,259
service as far as I not carry mark

273
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,790
service

274
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,819
zongo grid and fewer this sass the

275
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,799
reason why there's so many players is

276
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:28,439
when 11 years back or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

278
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:36,439

279
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:38,759
all of a sudden it's a SAS<font color="#E5E5E5"> power so</font>

280
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:40,949
Cisco itself I don't know whether I

281
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,869
mention or we use 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> a billion service</font>

282
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:45,029
providers most of them are stashed

00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:48,839
orders over<font color="#CCCCCC"> for HR for supply chain for</font>

285
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,419
a service one of the main key players or

286
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,459
Microsoft Azure platform google apps

287
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:59,399
Google Docs is against ass but Google

288
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,079
Google Apps cisco has got its own couple

289
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,629
of them but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how famous are</font>

290
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,819
there like USS Enterprise operating

291
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:08,729
system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rebecca net and</font>

292
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:10,889
infrastructure we use Amazon we use

293
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:14,039
service we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> terremark so and so forth</font>

294
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:15,749

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,380
have their own private clouds or

314

for the security of your application

354
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:11,189
the cloud provider has a control and

that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ensure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that cloud</font>

sure that you can always refer back the

376
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:20,039
is an issue the complexity comes in when

377
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:23,250
a SAS provider uses a pass model to host

378
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,158
their application just for an example

379
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:31,830
let's say salesforce.com which is a SAS

380
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:34,380
provider uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft platform in a</font>

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,899
pass model and deploy their applications

382
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,639
but as far as I know saifou.com had

383
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:40,590
their own internal their own data

384

<font color="#E5E5E5">application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they won't all</font>

386
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,230
the whole tech stack and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

387
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:51,418
the application as a service but if a

388
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:55,139
SAS provider uses past provider who then

389
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:57,000
uses a different is in provider now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

390
00:17:55,139 --> 00:18:01,590
now all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a sudden we have at least</font>

391
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,470
four players who in that application who

392
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,820
needs to understand okay now<font color="#CCCCCC"> whom</font>

393
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,030

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,590
security of publication

395
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:13,030
and the data within<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so again it</font>

396
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,669

397
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,680
data is all public data so then it

needs to understand who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is accountable</font>

438
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,149
for the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who is doing what</font>

439
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:03,340
and and especially if you have

440
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-tenant model where you data where</font>

441
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,179
the infrastructure or platformers

442
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,530
application course data belong to

443
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,610
multiple consumed with multiple

444
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:16,010
customers so obviously just in

445
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:18,620
is the risk the second risk is user

446
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,390
identities proliferation of user

447
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,719
identities let's say in the previous

448
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,880
example as I said our cisco uses to

449
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,570
hundreds of the survey software service

450
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,110
providers and the let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

451
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,270
employee uses even 10 of those

452
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:38,260
applications hosted at different at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

453
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:42,370
different service providers so if and

454
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,809
each vendor whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inbuilt</font>

455
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you deploy in your data</font>

456
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,280
center<font color="#E5E5E5"> or on the cloud they will have</font>

457
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,149
their own authentication authorization

458
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:55,070
mechanism to make the application

459
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:58,669
complete so if each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those providers</font>

460
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:01,428
create a account or identity for each of

461
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:05,840
the employees<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the consumer or the</font>

462
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:08,030
users of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer and store it get a</font>

known user store in a rather sell diaper

464
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,850
database then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically they can</font>

465
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of the user at only the user</font>

471
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:32,870
other applications you end up not only

472
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,549
user experience issues but out you would

473
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,709
think what happens to the lifecycle

474
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:39,500
management of those user<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs if a</font>

480
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,959

automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4hf process in especially</font>

482
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,100
large companies but because these

483
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,190
identities are evolved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud so</font>

484
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,918
the you the employee who left just left

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:07,010
this company and joints computer company

486
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,809
can still access those identities if

487
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,020
assuming there are no appropriate

488
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,970
controls and access they know what

489
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,010
depends on the data sense to dragon is

490
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sales promotions or pricing</font>

491
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,750
models which

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:24,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as a time</font>

493
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,110
goes so probably most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people are</font>

494
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,870
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> using this so that the solution</font>

495
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:33,139
the mitigation is to use identity

496
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,179
federation so I am sure pretty large

497
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,130
companies are already using Samuel based

498
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,730
integrator Federation refrigerator ID

499

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:49,700
vendors like site<font color="#CCCCCC"> member and so on so</font>

forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle who provide I am different</font>

503
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,670
in the sense that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several ways</font>

504
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,980
of implementing that but the recommended

505
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,920
model is not to replicate the user

506
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,700
identities across these providers so

507
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,590
just to keep the enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown in the</font>

508
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,380
middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and identify they should</font>

511

into one application and the other will

525
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,410
recognize that so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

526
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,360
integrations that are already

527
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:59,510
implemented across some matured cloud

528
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,570
providers and again automated use the

529
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,520
lifecycle mean if you cannot force the

530
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,760
cloud providers to come to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

531
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,250
store for authentication you need to at

532
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,350
least implement a mechanism to automate

533
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:15,170
the user termination or lifecycle

534
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,850
management of the user identities you

535
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,460
know in place to make sure that the

536
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,320
youth users access is terminated right

537
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,860
away there are some cloud part where you

538
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,860
cannot infer

539
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,120
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's some technical</font>

540
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,340
reasons also<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the business models</font>

541
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,449
work that way the third one is

542
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:39,310
regulatory<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance the point here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

543
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:41,170
is the complexity in to demonstrate that

544
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,480
your applicants are compliant to the

545
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,560
regulatory laws like Fox ourselves or

546
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,140
people when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sox first came around I</font>

547
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,470
think just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spent like 20 million</font>

548
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,370
dollars to implement the controls across

549
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,780
the various levels in the organization

550
00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:02,010
the business users level IT admins level

551
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,960
80 developers level the so many right so

552
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:07,120
now if you for application that is

553
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">subject to find a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regulator complem for</font>

the HIPAA Sox<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're deploying in</font>

555
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,960
the cloud so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

556
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,200
same kind of control that you

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,640
implemented in your in your internal the

558
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,530
company or<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise are also</font>

559
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,210

560
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,670
complex in demonstrating you need to

561
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,640
still prove it to whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eddie who is</font>

562
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,920
assessing your applications and data to

00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soft certification or a HIPAA</font>

those geography locations are not

00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,410
implementing those similar kind of laws

572
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,250
then the complexity comes to demonstrate

573
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,110
them so the mitigations again is applied

574
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,700

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:42,480
so the fourth one is business continued

586
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,480
and resilience

587
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,300
if an application is a business critical

588
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,190
and revenue impacting and if you the

589
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:57,810
cloud consumer migrates the application

590
00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:01,710
into the cloud right then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

591
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:06,510
implications kept if the data center of

592
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:08,910
the cloud provider are impacted by a

593
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,750
terrorist act without man-made or

594
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,720
natural disasters right so if the data

595
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,370
center is on the beltline of an

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,490
earthquake cone zone or hurricane or

597
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,459
whatever and if the application that you

598
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,830
just deployed or migrate to cloud is as

599
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,700
revenge impacting our business critical

600
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:31,919
so we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that the</font>

601
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,110
application can be brought up either

602
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,200
manually or automated within the within

603
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,990
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements so it and what</font>

604
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,180
and some applications ordering systems

605
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,010
let's say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are down for one hour</font>

606
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,700
it may result<font color="#E5E5E5"> in millions of dollars of</font>

607
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:50,280
loss so who is paying for that and all

608
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,410
who is penalized for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those such such</font>

609
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:57,810
kind of risks and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

610
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,840
data centers of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud providers are</font>

611
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:03,870
built as<font color="#E5E5E5"> per industry standards and they</font>

612
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,209
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> an active active mode if one data</font>

613
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:10,080

614
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,060
running and and be online immediately or

615
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,340
automated or at least in a manually

616
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,870
bring online but better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that key</font>

617
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,870
isolate our time tan lines

618
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:27,000
the next risk is the secondary usage of

619
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,700
data so it you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have noticed that</font>

620
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you send a nap in a user an email on</font>

about your trip so next time you log

00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,990
into gmail you will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

624
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,300
advertisements related to that that

<font color="#CCCCCC">information so someone is obviously</font>

626
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,440
gmail is data mining that information

627
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,129
and from their perspective they are

628
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,740
providing it some features<font color="#CCCCCC"> or help</font>

trying to help their users about your

00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,620
trip but it's all data treated like that

631
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,899
you know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay finding the</font>

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,719
restaurants or some information led to

633
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,920
your trip or travel is good but if it is

<font color="#E5E5E5">a patient information right so do do</font>

635
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:12,660
users like the fact that ok now we are

life insurance policy is related to that

639
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:26,129
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all that so so that the</font>

640
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,900
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is who is in control of your</font>

642
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,840
consumer are the policies to protect the

643
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,420
privacy of the cloud consumer so now are

644
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,040
the cloud provider who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> acces</font>

645
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,690
physical access to the data in their

646
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,480
data centers can they sell it to the

647
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:44,820
third parties who could then market that

648
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,560
information or use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for business for</font>

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own business but the problem is</font>

650
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:53,190
how does it impact give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piracy and</font>

651
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:55,020
what the how does it impact your opinion

652
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,240
in data and if the data is across the

653
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,700
Jewish jurisdictional borders<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot</font>

654
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,290
you cannot even you know do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

655
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,540
about it sometime the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored</font>

656
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:09,340
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that outside the US</font>

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">district in for example</font>

658
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,730
again the mitigations is we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cloud</font>

659
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,560
consumer needs to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure they work</font>

660
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,370
with the cloud providers to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

661
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy how the data is used that the</font>

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">data is should not be used in individual</font>

663
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,990
cloud consumer data is encrypted di

664
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,570
indication of personal information and

665
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,780
so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth and also main thing is</font>

666
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consent whether the user want to opt</font>

in for those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data mining or</font>

668
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,020
second usage of the data or they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

669
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:46,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">opt-out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those those kind of our</font>

670
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:49,730
second usage the next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the</font>

671
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,200
service and data integration this is one

672
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:57,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the models that we are working on</font>

673
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco where the users right use cloud</font>

674
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,540
brokers to access multiple cloud

675
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,210
providers and more and more applications

676
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,770
that move out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their internal cloud or</font>

677
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,490
internal data center to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public cloud</font>

678
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:13,280
the more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more requirements come back</font>

679
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:15,500
from the same business<font color="#CCCCCC"> units to correct</font>

680
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,420
back into the enterprise data stores so

681
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,040
you you got you migrate the application

682
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,170
but you cannot really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean sometimes</font>

683
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may in case of federal government</font>

684
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,400
they are saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

close<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the data centers some some of</font>

686
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,270
them but in a typical organization

687
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've promised in a hybrid cloud model</font>

688
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,490
is still will go some of the beginning

689
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,200
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal cloud and some outside</font>

690
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,060
so the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more applications go out</font>

691
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,830
the more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more requires come back to</font>

692
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,840
integrate with your internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> debtors and</font>

693
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:46,100
databases so how that the data in

694
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,699
transit and data in store storage where

695
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:52,790
we store at multiple integration points

696
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,000
how secure are they right let's another

697
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:58,879
risk so make sure the data at rest is

698
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,740
secure data in transit a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> to SSL</font>

699
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,440
mutual authenticated between the two any

two entities in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transit and the data</font>

701
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,630
is all protected to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you</font>

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,390
know secure channels and

are used for different consumer

705

709
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:29,060
all protected by the same key well its

710
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,770
product it's all encrypted which is the

711
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,169
same cure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unique key four per</font>

customer and who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to those</font>

713

714
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:43,760
is multi-tenancy and physical security

715
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:48,550
so the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> centers of data centers</font>

716
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:52,400
is obviously important so if there is a

717
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:54,950
theft at a data center right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has</font>

718
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,040
multiple customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> really how data is on</font>

00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so it impacts multiple</font>

721
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,070
customers in a multi-tenant model in a

722
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,330
single tenant model if some<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know where</font>

723
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:11,480
each got their own physical or at least

illogical controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> around a customer</font>

725
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,940

<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-tenant model where there are web</font>

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here is if the change is</font>

762
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,820
be architected in such a way that

763
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,580
impacts only that unit so make sure the

764
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,910
security controls our architecture for

765
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:06,400

have an incident relate to one customer

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,620
or one cloud consumer but the due to the

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-tenancy you have data relate to</font>

809
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,270
multiple cloud consumers on that so what

<font color="#E5E5E5">does that mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the rest</font>

811
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,600
of the customers if you freeze the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc</font>

812
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,620
and their application run or their data

813
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:06,680
is accessible is it something else so as

814
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:13,190
I said detailed forensic VM images to

815
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:15,620
make sure that when such a incident

816

happens now wheres FBS free that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is can</font>

817
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,759
the applicator this needs to be some

model for the applicants to continue to

goes back to risk for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their for the</font>

823
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,049
business continued and resiliency and

824
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:38,000
comprehensive logging to make sure that

825
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,370
you have in the cloud florida has enough

826
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,300
data to analyze when there is an

827
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,040
incident but at the same time it should

828
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,900
not compromise performance of the

829
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,500
application so the business to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

830
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:55,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of very comparable</font>

831
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:58,040
model to it to balance of those two so

832
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,930
that's the next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font>

security them the important point here

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't apply just for is providers</font>

you know SAS providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> past providers</font>

836
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,980
they all have infrastructure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> divide</font>

there the horse whether the ports<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

843
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:27,059
open unnecessary ports are open or is

844
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:30,660
that the default configuration passwords

are are now properly changed or managed

846
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,368
to make sure that there are they don't

847

such such applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> or services so</font>

850
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:46,769
again the third party audits that again

851
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,960
as I said some of these mitigations

852
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:52,288
could dissolve multiple risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> or health</font>

853
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,450
including multiple fish the third party

audits<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a vulnerability assessments</font>

855
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,129
of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> uplift</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those providers let's</font>

856
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:03,329
say this infrastructure is certified by

857
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:06,359
this particular cloud auditor and make

858
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:08,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that those are Pee get information</font>

859
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:10,200
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a provider what controls they how</font>

860
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:11,849
to harden the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network modern</font>

861
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,710
infrastructure and do they have

862
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,749
segregation of duties and again this

863
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:18,029
applies for the sox compliance and other

864
00:39:15,749 --> 00:39:19,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">components tiered architecture with</font>

depth even if there is a web server

which is compromised that make sure that

869
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:31,079
the next level which is absolute here is

870

not come for you even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they could get</font>
