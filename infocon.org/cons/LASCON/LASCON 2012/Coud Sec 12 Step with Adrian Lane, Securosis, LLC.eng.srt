1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,550
this is the cloud sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 step and what</font>

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,290
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be covering today is I'm</font>

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over a brief overview of</font>

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud I don't necessarily know what your</font>

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,379
backgrounds are with clouds who's who

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,730
has implementations in the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font>

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,619
and prototyping in the cloud or who is

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,480
totally new so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover some of</font>

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,000
the overview stuff for what cloud

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,920
computing is go through the 12 steps and

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,230
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some recommendations so just a</font>

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,420
quick show of hands how many of you in

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,160
the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are in the clouds</font>

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,899
either personally or your company and is

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,898
that software as a service kind of thing

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">one hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how many view have a</font>

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,640
credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card pretty much everybody yeah</font>

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,840
so everybody in here who has a credit

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">card could be on the clock right</font>

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,010
freaking now it's gotten to be that easy

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,899
and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> got started doing cloud</font>

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,699
research I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've been</font>

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,760
computer since 1987 I started putting

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,809
professionally I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an analyst</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,939
securities now for about three years

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">before that I was a CTO or vp of</font>

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,689
engineering at several different

28
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,130
startups some doing security products

29
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,439
I'm doing financial products in a secure

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,329
fashion so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> my background</font>

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,098
we were contacted by the cloud security

32
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:20,579
alliance about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago to write</font>

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,139
the the cloud security training program

34
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we've spent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the better part of</font>

35
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,889
the last year going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through different</font>

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,990
cloud models and figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

37
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,548
heck to secure them whether the amazon

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,079
and rackspace your go great or what have

39
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,819
you and writing them training<font color="#E5E5E5"> curriculum</font>

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,109
so a lot of what you're going to see

41
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,079
today comes from that practical

42
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,770
experience we also run portions of our

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,458
business in the cloud we have an amazon

44
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">account and i use it solely for the</font>

00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,340
purpose of going to starbucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,340
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i go to starbucks i created</font>

48
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,749
encrypted VPN up to amazon and i can run

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,309
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sessions that way and not worry</font>

00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:02,009
about firesheep for getting seen emptor

51
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:04,319
or getting hacked what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

52
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,959
bill per month is because my<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> account</font>

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:19,810
no 58 cents per month<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know when I</font>

56
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,519
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it no seriously it's 58</font>

57
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,160
cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> a month and that's just because of</font>

58
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the network family and and I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dawn to me when I when I was putting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">together the slide deck and then the</font>

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,010
reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> called it you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud</font>

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">like 12 step is that you got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you are powerless to stop your</font>

64
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,080
company from going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud you will</font>

65
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,970
be going there just what type of cloud

66
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,049
are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using you know what</font>

67
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,760
does the model that you're going to be

68
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,040
approaching it and what portions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,730
services are going there it's too

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,920
plentiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to elastic too easy to use and</font>

71
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,018
to cost effective even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,700
organizations I talked with are moving

73
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,290
and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got tons of compliance</font>

74
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,149
regulations that they worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

75
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,590
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a different form of clouds</font>

76
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,180
is take care of those compliance

77
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,269
regulations I'll go more into that later

78
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,349
so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud I mean most of you</font>

79
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,030
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to note because you've heard</font>

80
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,819
about sales force or use Salesforce

81
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,260
circle but not you might use netflix

82
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,420
obviously that's another consumer

83
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,489
example but now basically what it is is

84
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,500
an abstraction of infrastructure the

85
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,340
very first cloud as I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it came into</font>

86
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,540
existence because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon realized that</font>

87
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,130
on any given day they only needed one

88
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,560
percent capacity but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Christmas</font>

89
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,930
week or month or whatever they needed

90
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,459
you know a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent capacity and</font>

91
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,319
so for the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the euro it was all</font>

92
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,150
wasted so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire model is to</font>

93
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,560
abstract the infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stretch</font>

94
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,760
the resources and resell that to other

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,609
people who could take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,350
and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be dynamic and elastic</font>

97
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to sign up for it if I</font>

98
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,340
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more resources I can scale up</font>

99
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,310
unless I scale back down it should be

100
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,900
able to do that automatically for me

101
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,120
resource democratization I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

102
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,440
to have an admin go out there and take a

103
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,760
couple of servers and put it in a rack

104
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,889
and reconfigure them for you know it's

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,358
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be elastic it's got to be dynamic</font>

106
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,849
in that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can come in sign</font>

107
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,190
up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get the resources they need</font>

108
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,619
it's a pay-as-you-go model you use

109
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:07,349
resources you pay for them you shut

110
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,349
those resources down you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

111
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:15,250
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST model for cloud</font>

112
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,930
computing and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how good the</font>

113
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,548
contrast here is there's really two

114
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,530
things I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really want to point</font>

115
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:22,210
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've kind of just covered the top</font>

116
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,469
piece about what the cloud is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

117
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,570
pieces I want you to pay attention here

118
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,690
are the service models and employment

119
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,430
models so the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> models software as</font>

120
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">a service you're literally buying an</font>

121
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,240
application that sits out there you do

122
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,979
very little except put your data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

123
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,300
and manage a couple configuration

124
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,790
settings for how you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

125
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,460
accounts and so forth you're familiar

126
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,660
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but today most of you if you're</font>

127
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,310
here to ask you're not particularly

128
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,510
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other two</font>

129
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,160
models I think you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be most</font>

130
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,190
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in long-term so</font>

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure of the service basically</font>

132
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,340
you're buying into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure you</font>

133
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,840
assembling infrastructure just like you

134
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,060
would in your own data center except

135
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,919
it's out in the cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then platform</font>

136
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,770
as a service and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go into a little</font>

137
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit greater detail what that is you get</font>

138
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,490
some additional infrastructure and

139
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,409
applications given to you prepackaged

140
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,060
all ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you use their api you</font>

141
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,760
use their messaging queues and so forth

142
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,410
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are buying a platform so in that</font>

143
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,320

199
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,409
about here today is the service side of

200
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:26,760
the cloud meaning the server

201
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,530
infrastructures that support the

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're most are interested in but</font>

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the other half of it and that's</font>

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,490
virtualization technology and in fact

209
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,860
the measurement unit that all of the

210
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,449
cloud provider uses is a machine unit

211
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,509
much like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the virtual</font>

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine image so well all the cloud</font>

213
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:59,099
providers use it the cloud itself is not

214
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:01,470
a virtualized box so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a taxonomy</font>

215
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,240
Chris hop did this a couple years ago if

216
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,970
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the taxonomy of</font>

some interesting examples you're going

293
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,220
encourage all of you to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,410
rackspace look at OpenStack look at the

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,870
OpenStack movement a lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

296
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,600
prefer that to develop open applications

297
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,770
it's just that ec2 was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

298
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,020
accessible for me because already<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an</font>

00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,030
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is easier to get screenshots</font>

300
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,550
it's cheap and it was just faster for me

301
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,530
to put the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'll</font>

303
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:23,140

your internal organization with

not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same your architecture and</font>

347
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,870
design is still in house deployment can

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,750
still be in-house testing maybe maybe

349
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,100
not I'll get more into that in the

350
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,990
testing session and the production

351
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,769

356
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,290

357
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure your provider or get your</font>

358
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,399
provider to validate that they're giving

359

you security you've got to work out with

360
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,579
them every provider is different so I

361
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,540
had a couple slides on threat modeling I

362
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

363
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,920
them all but you will be threat modeling

364
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
your cloud deployment about how the

365
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,029
applications are deployed which

366
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,700
components can communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

367
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:49,450
components you know how you're going to

368
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,760
threat model the provider hack and these

369
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,769
have happen you know cloud deployments

370
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,810
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked or they have had</font>

371
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:57,250
failures within load balancing or other

372
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,619
sorts of tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are supposed to</font>

373
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,779
segregate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep users at multi-tenant</font>

374
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,910
environment separate and they work until

375
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,540
they don't which means occasionally they

376
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,140
fail so<font color="#E5E5E5"> design for threats any</font>

377
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,329
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going to deploy</font>

378
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,010
in the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to reconsider who</font>

379
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,899
owns what and how it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

380
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,819
secured and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a basic</font>

381
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:17,950
breakdown of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things you want to</font>

382
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,990
consider for different types of threat

383
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,589
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the scoping</font>

384
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,480
attacks authentication for elevation of

385
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,890
privilege authorization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll dig</font>

386
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,399
into a little deeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that and a</font>

387
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,399
couple slides

388
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:37,000
so I'd already mentioned what you can

389
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:38,470
test you need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't</font>

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fuzz test on a live environment</font>

391
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,209
within the cloud and it's not feasible

392
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,480
the beauty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that you can</font>

393
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,739
leverage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,269
service to actually give yourself a

395
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,890
private cloud and do full testing in a

396
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,709
very closely mimic or production

397
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,480
environment you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but all of these</font>

398
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,649
things about multi tendency and about

399
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,709
different threat models you need to take

400
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:04,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">into account so I think I've done in too</font>

401
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,310
much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so within the slide deck</font>

402
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,170
I'll put this up I do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a</font>

403
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,329
handy chart about how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach some</font>

404
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,310
of the application architecture issues

405
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,779
and where to put your resources I know

406
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,910
it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit small and hard to read</font>

407
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,439
but will make the slide deck available

408
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,839
so you can check it out after the

409
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,890
presentation so identity not rosacea

410
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,720
there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of very good</font>

411
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,970
presentations undoubtedly on identity

412
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,360
authorization for cloud services during

413
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,170
the course of this week obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

414
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,060
identity of the things you're worried

415
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is registering users both internal</font>

416
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,229
and external propagation of those users

417
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,520
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using a cloud service</font>

418
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,390
that it goes across multiple cloud

419
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,800
boundaries for example Rackspace or an

all pretty traditional stuff right

ldap server maybe maybe not what we're

437
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,230
seeing is that the vendors provide

438
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:29,680
pretty good infrastructure for for most

439
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,329
basic cloud deployments you know if

you're fully in a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

the cloud

447
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,019
you can still take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

have today and have those cloud services

link in with the traditional existing IT

450
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:56,019

489
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,210
probably a bias in my slide deck<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes to spin up a window box in the</font>

495
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,980

I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it out so almost all of</font>

the train<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been providing has</font>

00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,230
you know spin up stuff quickly run a

503
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:08,879
test and spin it back down that's that's

504
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,490
a big deal so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure bias on my part I</font>

505
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,150
just because i'm lazy don't want to

506

<font color="#E5E5E5">weigh around code analysis I really had</font>

00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,880
trouble putting this number four in here

508
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:23,820
the reason I put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

509
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,110
you can't do image validation if you

510
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,520
can't validate the machine before you

511

dynamic we have application testing

513
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:36,090
really better be doing binary analysis

514
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,129
or white box testing if you have the

515
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,110
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> of validating the stack and</font>

516
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's later in the slide presentation</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously the cloud security guidance</font>

519
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,170
and most of the people who found the

cloud security alliance recommend it but

521
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:59,490
use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> best judgment so testing one of</font>

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,340
you don't have to worry about others

you have to do the work because they

don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so but most of them</font>

00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:50,009
kind of as an example because<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font>

the cloud provider delighted a

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to let you do fuzzing a lot of</font>

576
00:21:55,139 --> 00:22:04,769
other type of stress testing so app

577

578
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,549
slides in here for some of the audience

00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">members but to start with a lot of this</font>

580
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,840
is going to look like exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

581
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:16,549
do today there<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a firewall</font>

582
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,779
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to be a laugh</font>

583
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,279
there are some new technologies out

584
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:23,009
there that allow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take another</font>

machine imogen or I'm sorry embed within

586
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,850
your own stack honeypotted so it'll

587
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:28,739
leave small traces of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what looks like a</font>

588
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,120
vulnerability if it gets attacked you

589
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,460
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're under attack you can take</font>

590
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,459
countermeasures either through a lap or

591
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,909
through some other technology firewall

592
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,710
is inherent to the cloud providers so

593
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:42,929
once again service level agreement find

594
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,909
out what your vendor is going to filter

595
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,350
if you're on infrastructure as a service

596
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,990
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely you're going to you're going</font>

598
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,370
filtering I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that more later</font>

599
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,429
if you're on platform as a service

600
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,418
varies varies from provider and I threw

601
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:02,940
this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for one of our audience</font>

602
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">members because this is what we have</font>

603
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">been seeing for most literature right</font>

604
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,699
firewalls and ssl firewalls and ssl not

605
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,699
so this is not going to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

606
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:21,570
so let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into information security</font>

607
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,850
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a piece of guidance that we had</font>

608
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,750
created for the cloud security alliance

609
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:29,520
it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but what it does</font>

610
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,780
do a good job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is is kind of</font>

611
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,120
dividing up all the different use cases

612
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,879
for data where is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how is it used or</font>

613
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,050
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> go how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it get stored and</font>

614
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I actually put it in here</font>

615
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,250
is both to let you know if it doesn't

616
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:43,050
work but also it in almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single</font>

617
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">step encryption is that is the core</font>

618
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:53,700
value so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be using</font>

619
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:56,820
encryption a lot for data storage for

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,470
data migration what have you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

621
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose to encrypt at a number of</font>

622
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">different levels one of the biggest</font>

623
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,220
threats that we ran across one when

624
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,440
creating the the guidance or the

625
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,260
training class was we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

626
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,450
you're taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup in the cloud it</font>

627
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,629
is trivial you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in you make a</font>

628
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,160
snapshot it's done in seconds creates a

629
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,230
copy of your entire infrastructure or

630
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,920
your entire database or just a volume

631
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,780
whatever you want but it's also trivial

632
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,470
to press another button and have that

633
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,730
public and press another button and 30

634
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,360
seconds later it's moved to a different

635
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,300
cloud you can quite literally if you

636
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,760
have a compromise lose your entire

637
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,740
infrastructure in a matter of seconds in

638
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:47,820
a scalable<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-performance elastic way</font>

639
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:51,650
so encryption is your friend the

640
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,250
question is where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it</font>

641
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,600
obviously you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do it if</font>

642
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,809
you're moving data up to the cloud so

643
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,040
there are there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL capabilities for</font>

644
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,770
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud provider that's out</font>

645
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,879
there how you enforce rights management

646
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,059
probably going to be through

647
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,380
certificates the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you leave</font>

648
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,510
there can be stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a number of</font>

649
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways the two ways we see most</font>

650
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:15,390
commonly you know like a TrueCrypt

651
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,280
volume encryption or transparent

652
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,450
encryptions like a like a war metric on

653
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,129
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file system side or like a bill</font>

654
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,950
to know some of the databases like IBM

655
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,580
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle on the database side and then</font>

656
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,980
once again like many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

657
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,260
internet you know in criminais ting

658
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,450
photos and what have you data lives in

659
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,299
the cloud a really long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it's</font>

660
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,470
redundant because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon loses a</font>

661
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:40,179
server they want to make sure you don't

662
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose data so there are multiple copies</font>

663
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:44,260
out there and they do a great job of you

664
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:48,519
know shredding old disks and so forth

665
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,809
but just to be sure a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people</font>

666
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:51,220
we're talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and enterprises are</font>

667
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:54,820
looking at crypto shredding as opposed

668
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,850
to data you know eradicating data

669
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,289
through scrubbing disks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they simply</font>

670
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,750
at some point in time will throw away

671
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:04,809
the keys on older data that's the that's

672
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,570
becoming the security model so once

673
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,769
again where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually deploy</font>

674
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,710
application layer is probably the most

675
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,710
secure you're not worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where</font>

676
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,960
the keys are going to be used or stored

677
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,820
as much and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> much easier to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

678
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,340
to control what it's encrypted with

679
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,760
whipped key to very granular level it's

680
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,379
also pain in the ass to code so what we

681
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,690
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> most often as I said transparent</font>

682
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,070
forms of encryption either the<font color="#CCCCCC"> file</font>

683
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">system layer or at the database layer</font>

684
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:35,110
and once again simple volume are simple

685
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,120
volume encryption and and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

686
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,320
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we normally will teach</font>

687
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,479
in a class because it's relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

688
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,149
to set up a volume crip<font color="#E5E5E5"> shin test it out</font>

689
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,710
get it to work every single pod provider

690
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:51,580
a bit on so far it works beautifully so

691
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:53,830
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put the keys this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem</font>

692
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,330
so you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of this</font>

693
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,710
presentation is making the assumption

694
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,100
that you guys as developers are going to

695
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,330
be out there prototyping applications

696
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,158
with or without the support of your

697
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,490
organization so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to</font>

698
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,370
do things quick fast and easy and we see

699
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,429
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of developers put some code out</font>

700
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:14,860
test it and they leave the key on the

701
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:15,940
volume so it's right in the machine in

702
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't they take a back up because</font>

703
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,429
they're putting code out there and they

704
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:23,500
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they've got a</font>

705
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">backup well wherever that image goes he</font>

706
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,990
goes with it

707
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:29,210
so somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else starts up another image</font>

708
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,760
of what you store it out there they have

709
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,309
the key and can get into the volume so

710
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,020
it may sound trivial but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

711
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:38,450
really common problem that the key gets

712
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,679
stored write<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on the disk so you</font>

713
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,870
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some sort of a key</font>

714
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,919
management service<font color="#CCCCCC"> your the</font>

715
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,658
infrastructure providers will actually

716
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,630
have some key services for you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

717
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:52,039
built in the the platform as a service

718
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,789
providers usually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's for this</font>

719
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:59,120
you can use key servers commercially

720
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:01,400
available Keith servers some so most of

721
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,809
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hsm nowadays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are setting up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API so</font>

that you can continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage</font>

725
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,630
simply linked them up to your cloud

726
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,330
services once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> leveraging existing</font>

730
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">already has the key server setup if you</font>

731
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:31,760
bring it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tell it which instances</font>

00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:33,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are valid and it does all the key</font>

733
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
negotiation for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

734
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,980
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you might bring up</font>

735
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,260
nine machine images but only four of

736
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">them are valid so who is really supposed</font>

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> volume who is</font>

00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,158
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting keys not every</font>

740
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:50,059
so I think trend<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro and there's at</font>

741
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,530
least like one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> other vendors out</font>

742
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,700
there that have that sort of thing even

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,350
build a key management oh that's an

744
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,640
independent service and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there</font>

745
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,428
are other vendors who you know provide

748
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,330
cordon off that virtual machine image

749
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,780
and then building your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

750
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:12,918
logic that secures a new images being

752
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:19,520

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:23,418
review you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can move this stuff</font>

765

monitoring how does the sim fit in here

766
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,530
yeah there's no good answer and varies

767
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,480
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on which which part are you</font>

768
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:10,620
going to what's actually going to be

769
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">available so what we see for monitoring</font>

770
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,449

772
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,020
application firewalls very common we're

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,510
seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of database activity</font>

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,790
especially for sharepoint and moves up

778
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,250

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:37,440
most of us regex filtering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also</font>

781
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:40,050
do other types of hash comparisons and

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,000
looking for sensitive data<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually I'm</font>

saying this now people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulling vlp</font>

784
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,170
on the data that moves up into the

785
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,520
clouds so they can categorize it and

786
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,170
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive information</font>

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,850
is and then figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how they're going</font>

788

to secure once it gets up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there not the</font>

789
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,340
best model but at least they've got some

790
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of an idea what they move into the</font>

791
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,679
cloud and then in various other service

792
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,230
monitors monitoring the database

793
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,840
services application services to pulling

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own sensors for for event</font>

795
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,040
collection and what's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

796
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,200
the monitoring technologies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud</font>

797
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,010
is that they're running on virtualized

798
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,870
images most of the providers cannot take

799
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,730
the stock product that they have and

800
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:19,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">just move it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud doesn't</font>

801
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:21,000
usually work very well because the data

802
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,890
collectors need very specific things

803
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the operating system and so they've</font>

804
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:28,530
all had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to port or change the data</font>

805
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,560
collectors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they install on the</font>

806
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,470
virtual machines that's one of the big

807
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,370
differences most of the early cloud

808
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,290
monitoring technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

809
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,020
literally threw all their stuff onto an

810
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,210
ami put it out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to use but</font>

811
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font>

812
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,120
had to spend hours actually configuring

813
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,889
the thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work not</font>

814
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,449
such a good model so we're finally

815
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:48,250
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the security vendors you</font>

816
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,830
know port their port or data collectors

817
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,930
actually configure their images and and

818
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:59,199
make these actually implement more cloud

819
00:31:52,930 --> 00:32:00,880
accessible so here's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

820
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,590
examples and once again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an</font>

821
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,660
endorsement of any particular technology

822
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,709
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of I want to make sure you</font>

823
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,570
guys are aware of what's out there

824
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,610
available so we'd go grid right now

825
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,320
within the load balancers they've

826
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,689
actually deployed f5 as a web

827
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,280
application firewall for you and you

828
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,810
could do some custom configuration on

829
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,660
this but it's been built into the

830
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the you know a</font>

831
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,480
more traditional kind of a SAS model

832
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:29,020
where you are doing a DNS redirect to be

833
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,640
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do laughs and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lp so you can</font>

834
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,900
just bolt this on anywhere and then

835
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,370
redirect the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in your own</font>

836
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:41,080
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> or public cloud pretty much for</font>

837
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,280
infrastructure of the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

838
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,120
agent-based deployment for database

839
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:49,180
security database activity monitoring

840
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,600
and the last one down here pre-built ami

841
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,890
is once again you're basically shoving

842
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,480
the monitoring piece into an ami

843
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,040
configuring it to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and monitor</font>

844
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,560
you just need to basically tell it which

845
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:04,330
app which applications and and which

846
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:05,879
instances you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want monitor so the third</font>

847
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:10,780
and final portion of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 step program</font>

848
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,300
infrastructure so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

849
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,910
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one that took me by surprise it</font>

850
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,629
was two black hats back that one of the

851
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:24,160
presentations actually showed how easy

852
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:27,850
it was to put a rogue infected Amazon

853
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,360
machine image out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Amazon anybody can</font>

854
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:32,580
do it anytime but the key was to getting

855
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,949
somebody to use it

856
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,600
so when you go into amazon or ringo into

857
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,250
Rackspace and<font color="#E5E5E5"> public images out there</font>

858
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,769
they're listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're listed in the</font>

859
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,419
order of popularity in use so there were

860
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,549
literally they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were writing small</font>

861
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,649
scripts to raise the popularity of their

862
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:49,559
rogue application up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just</font>

865
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,740
basically launching pre-built malware

pre-built botnet within your

if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take an ami you find</font>

869
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,750
a good one if you go directly to red hat

870
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,570
or you go directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US provider</font>

871
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,250
and get it as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of the</font>

872
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,960
security vendors now have prepackaged

873
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,869
this stuff so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a clean am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

might be that would be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> additional</font>

879
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:29,699
benefit not always possible so hardening

the stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font>

pieces if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do when you go out</font>

882
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,889
you'll notice that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

888
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,859
the problem arises<font color="#CCCCCC"> but once again you</font>

889
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,710
can contact almost every single vendor

890
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:56,449
nowadays has got an Amazon machine image

891
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,449
or some sort of a rackspace image

892
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:03,290
deployment stack hardening so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

893
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,000
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about all of the</font>

894
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,470
infrastructure service providers and

895
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,310
some of the platform service providers

896
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:12,618
is you can automatically patch and

897
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:16,910
pre-configure any single image that gets

898
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:19,750
launched they have right<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the launch</font>

899
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:25,970
screen the place to tell it what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

900
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:28,430
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give it a script and it's</font>

901
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,439
that simple now I've got both of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

902
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,899
enabled here not one commented out but I

903
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,800
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can either update or upgrade to</font>

904
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:38,630
a new version automatically prior launch

905
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,670
right there and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it happened</font>

906
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,550
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the launch screen</font>

907
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,720
when it does in fact we put messages of

908
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day and there to tell us if the</font>

909
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,990
thing actually succeeded or not so we

910
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we got successfully patched</font>

911
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:53,029
successfully updated right there in the

912
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,890
console it's a very handy way to make

913
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,210
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as your infrastructure moves</font>

914
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,589
forward expands and contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

915
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:01,010
actually stays<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as</font>

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:05,060
patching goes in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that you</font>

917
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,350
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration so for</font>

918
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,910
this particular one what we're doing is

919
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:11,930
we're setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a my sequel instance to</font>

920
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:14,509
be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a unencrypted drive so we're</font>

921
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,330
just resetting where some of the my

922
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,800
sequel infrastructure is we're using it

923
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,029
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress environment so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

924
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,740
moving it over to encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume</font>

925
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:24,109
changing some stuff around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

926
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,810
relaunching<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we we can quite</font>

927
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:30,790
literally harden the installation right

928
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,790
there at<font color="#CCCCCC"> start of time very handy</font>

929
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,440
security zone step<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 of the 12 step</font>

930
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,080
program these are really cool feature

931
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just think about this as your your your</font>

932
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,750
network player and security zones are

933
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,490
basically a virtual definition of what

934
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,670
can communicate in your virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

935
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,990
this is how you define certain areas

936
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,880
where an application might reside our

937
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,770
database might reside or a cluster of

938
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,770
application that they reside and then

939
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:01,100
what protocols and what users can go in

940
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:04,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the security zones</font>

941
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,009
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined how data flows</font>

942
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,150
it will tell you where you're going to

943
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,830
be exposed your day is going to be

944
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">exposed where your applications will be</font>

945
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:20,710
exposed so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can set up a</font>

946
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,260
security zone with web server and with

947
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,390
some other application services define

948
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,700
which ports come in and for what

949
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,549
locations you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> define when to give</font>

950
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,980
public IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when not so if</font>

951
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,030
you only want one server in here to be

952
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,860
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate with other service</font>

953
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,660
in here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give it access to any</font>

954
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,020
sort of DNS services or external lookup

955
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,940
capabilities once again you can define

956
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,220
the ports so remember as i said earlier

957
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,230
today when i go to starbucks i create a

958
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,060
VPN connection up into my<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

959
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,470
and that's the only port that that

960
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,120
machine image is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and it's</font>

961
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:55,959
only going to take one<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate mine</font>

962
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,810
I can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from anywhere but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody</font>

963
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,500
else can<font color="#E5E5E5"> so very very handy way of</font>

964
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:05,290
setting up the network security very

965
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,970
quickly just a couple lines from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

966
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,770
consult of anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose service</font>

967
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,390
providers there's might be a little bit

968
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:13,870
clearer example what I'm talking about

969
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,879
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the examples that we give the</font>

970
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:18,520
train<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this we set up WordPress we</font>

971
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,990
set up my sequel we only allow them to

972
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,060
communicate over one port and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

973
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:28,540
database is inaccessible except for

974
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:34,170
anything except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 24 22 from my</font>

975
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:36,910
local machine in my house wordpress

976
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,040
instil maybe only available inside my

977
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:42,430
company what have you but this is how I

978
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,230
secure the basic network infrastructure

979
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,109
so this gets rid of a lot of need for

980
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:50,920
other types of security and then I can

981
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:52,960
really tailor whatever monitoring

982
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,230
software that I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check for</font>

983
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,230
threats

984
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:02,450
and then finally management<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

985
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,800
started presentation out with I mean

986
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:07,040
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

987
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,870
found to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest problem the</font>

988
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,960
management plane is so freaking powerful

989
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:14,660
that if it is compromised you can do

990
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything I mean all of the data can go</font>

991
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,379
the entire infrastructure can be

992
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:26,480
duplicated and then brought up somewhere

993
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:29,780
else it's a quite stunning so kind of an

994
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:32,330
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way that the management</font>

995
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,620
plane infrastructure for for database

996
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">com I just pulled this off because I</font>

997
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought I'd give it a pretty clear idea</font>

998
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,840
of what what they have available all of

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are available in</font>

1000
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,950
configurable right from them right to

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management console and unless you</font>

00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,419
set up the security zones availability

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and issue certificates to individual</font>

1004
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:52,790
users to kind of segregate this one

1005

person's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all that's usually too</font>

1006
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,440
high that I see it unfortunately that's

1007
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the case so in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planning of how</font>

1008
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,830
you're going to deploy its not just a

1009
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,210
security zone issue but you need to

1010
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:07,310
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to actually</font>

1011
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:11,870
realize separation of duties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes</font>

1012
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:16,490
for Google App Engine as well that goes

1013
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:18,620
for Amazon if you allow one admin user

1014
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,209
to have every single access right or a

1015
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,009
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that involved in the same</font>

1016
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,930
console you're setting yourself up for

1017
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,130
failure you don't want to put production

1018
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,870
data out there if you haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1019
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,130
proper separation of duties on them on

1020
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,130
the management plane

1021
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:37,739
so that's basically 12 steps I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

1022
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,670
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw a few more</font>

1023
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:43,380
things out there cost considerations you

1024
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">can design your application to scale</font>

1025
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,680
without having all the hardware

1026
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:50,670
available it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> naturally the service</font>

1027
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">oriented architecture consider that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1028
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:56,369
you are building that the resources are

1029
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:57,779
not an issue they're not a problem but

1030
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:01,170
shut down what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't use as I said</font>

1031
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:03,480
we're 58 cents a month for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrible</font>

1032
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,039
basic account that we use and it as long

1033
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we don't leave volume sitting up and</font>

1034
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:07,410
running as long as we don't leave other

1035
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:09,029
server setting up and running test

1036
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,879
servers then we get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a seventeen</font>

1037
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:13,559
eighteen twenty dollar bill so shut down

1038
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you don't use build the elasticity</font>

1039
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:17,489
into your configuration scripts so that

1040
00:41:16,109 --> 00:41:20,480
your application can grow and shrink is

1041
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:23,730
needed and you don't get overcharged but

1042
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,349
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use it I mean it's really</font>

1043
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually quite fascinating it's kind of</font>

1044
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:30,480
fun to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the OpenStack steps</font>

1045
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:32,940
really interesting and so go give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

1046
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,980
try go spin up a go spin up a drive and

1047
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,390
and encrypt it and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

1048
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,339
certificates look like and see how you

1049
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,890
might manage your certificates shut it

1050
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">down need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build for a buck you learn</font>

1051
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:48,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the cloud that's it</font>

1052
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,029
you
