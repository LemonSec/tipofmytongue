00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,630
love pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight forward to policy</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,009
policy for me including policy

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:13,280
governance and management audits things

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,170
like that running a security program

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,259
people is the last one and that includes

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like security awareness training</font>

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:25,350
personnel attacker profiling and as you

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,450
can see the ones on people aren't the

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,340

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,390
least different things well physical

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,190
we've been doing physical security as

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,989
long as there's been things to steal so

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,968
we're pretty good the technical so we've

16
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,239
been doing technical security for quite

17
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,010
a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> too we're not perfect you don't</font>

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,538
have the perfect firewall probably never

19
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,280
will we're always going to have

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,569
technical deficiencies will always be

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,479
fixing them what we're still pretty good

22
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:05,850
on the policy side we're getting a

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:08,158
little more shaky but in fact we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

24
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,860
doing this for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> British</font>

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,049
a while ago and that led to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ace of</font>

27
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:18,360
27,000 series and for the most part we

28
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,820
really do you understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,860
security program the people i think

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,199
largely as a profession we have failed

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,090
to deal with people we don't do a good

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,719
job handling people side of the equation

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,090
and oftentimes what I hear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,399
probably heard this as well is that

35
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,079
people are the problem you know the

36
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:46,170
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing would be easy to work for</font>

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:49,619
all these users so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,280
problem so there's a couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,759
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about this first of all that</font>

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">oftentimes is people are stupid and you</font>

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,280
can't fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid more people should know</font>

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,490
better people should know better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we</font>

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,229
click on

44
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,449
blink or open that attachment there you

45
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,699
know they should know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's people</font>

46
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,310
attachment and in fact there's an

47
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,899
article on sands diary<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incident</font>

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,970
pretty funny but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically says the user</font>

50
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,910
clicks<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something they should and we</font>

51
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,410
not going to be able to fix it so

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,709
security awareness training is my other

53
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,090
pet peeve and inevitably<font color="#E5E5E5"> when people do</font>

54
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,880
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> awareness training they say</font>

55
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,890
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up posters even though we</font>

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,120
have no way of knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this does</font>

57
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,829
any good at all and either<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,500
out emails telling everybody do good

<font color="#CCCCCC">things pick good passwords don't click</font>

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,150
on attachments that you don't know or I

61
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,920
think one of the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we can do</font>

62
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,100
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is say that security is everyone's</font>

63
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,690
business that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually leads them to the</font>

64
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide so Jessie Ann has been you</font>

65
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,500
did about three years of research

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,049
interviewing people and both IT and

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,730
security as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and non</font>

68
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,069
IT people about their attitudes about

69
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:11,140
security and this is a quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an</font>

70
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">email exchange I had with him so what I</font>

71
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:17,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he's really getting at here is</font>

72
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,359
that IT people think don't don't really

73
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,940
think much about the people they work

74
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:25,239
with they pretty much say you know if I

75
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,940
lead them with a stick you you get get

76
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right response they don't really</font>

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,510
take a creative approach in dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:36,700
people so rather than saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

79
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,040
are the problem my argument is that

80
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,839
design is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem so if the system</font>

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,150
fails somebody clicks on a link that

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,190
they shouldn't well the problem is we

83
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,900
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> never let them click on that link</font>

84
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">first place so really it's our</font>

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,180
responsibility to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the system</font>

86
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,019
fail-safe so the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can use</font>

87
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,540
the system without afraid so there's an

88
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,970
old paper that goes back all the way to

89
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,790
99 this is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTP was in the height of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">its popularity the title which some of</font>

91
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,130
you man heard of is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Johnny can</font>

92
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,560
decrypt so<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are 12 people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

93
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,930
the study fault educated professionals

94
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,560
they SAT them down with instructions in

95
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,670
front of a computer said here you go

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,500
encrypt an email and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

97
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,260
friend so they had to go through the key

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,230
exchange ahead assigned the email that

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,210
had to crimp even had to send it so all

100
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,390
those 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> people only three were</font>

101
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,549
successful even though and they say this

102
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the paper that this is actually a</font>

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,740
simple product to use for those who

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">already understand the basic models</font>

107
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,740
like saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's simple to use of</font>

108
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

109
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">think also that our expectations for</font>

110
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,180
people are part of the problem so I

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,370
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact there's a cognitive</font>

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,200
failure here what's obvious to us as

113
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,210
security experts we've been doing this

114
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,370
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't necessarily obvious to</font>

115
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,650
everyone else this is a common mistake

116
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,210
everybody makes this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

117
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,270
assumed that everybody thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

118
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they do but training everyone to be</font>

119
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,210
experts is impractical you know we don't

120
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">have when we have companies and we have</font>

121
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,590
we have a legal department we don't

122
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,000
train everybody to be a lawyer we train

123
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,359
them to know when they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to the</font>

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,400
legal department same thing and really

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,490
what we need to do is designer systems

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,760
to account for that lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> expertise so</font>

127
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,830
that in many cases actually taking over

128
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,300
the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions from the user</font>

129
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,330
because we shouldn't ask them to make

130
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,650
they're not qualified to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make and this</font>

131
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">has actually already started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font>

132
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,310
if you think about antivirus for those

133
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,299
of us who've been working with computers

134
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:55,729
for a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough back in the 80s when</font>

135
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,370
antivirus first came out what we had was

136
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey you got a virus would you like to</font>

137
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,949
clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yes or no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to make sense</font>

138
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,870
at the time somebody who would they're

139
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,930
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> too bad out if he was actually a</font>

140
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,180
virus maybe that was the case but the

141
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,159
reality is that most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

142
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,590
click yes and by giving people the

143
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,000
option to click<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you're actually just</font>

144
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,909
letting people shoot themselves in the

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,460

147
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,180
automatically doesn't give you that

148
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,830
option although<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some cases they might</font>

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just throw it and quarantine fuller so</font>

150
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,568
something horrible happens like I'm Mac

151
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:38,629
the update<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs to meet all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your office</font>

152
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:42,500
files that you can actually recover so

153
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:45,020
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up in a situation where we</font>

154
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,400
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal well with people well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

155
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,340
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a good story behind</font>

156
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,090
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says how a professional all</font>

157
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out as IT security you know</font>

158
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,679
when the first the first security was on

159
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,400
computers and we have the interaction of

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,069
people and computers and information but

161
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,500
as we evolve and decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

162
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,330
ourselves information security we

163
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,830
haven't quite caught up to the new model

164
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,979
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> people interacting with</font>

165
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,870
information there's no computers in that

166
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:19,279
equation now when you're talking about

167
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security so that's what we</font>

168
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,419
havior with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mason securities and attempt</font>

169
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,639
to address so it's not going to fix

170
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,219
technical problems but is a

171
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,639
philosophical shift that puts people

172
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">first so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is by putting people</font>

173
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,529
first we can build better policy better

174
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,940
technology even have better physical

175
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:43,279
security by understanding the people so

176
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,289
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ants definition of</font>

177
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,539
behavioral

178
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,460
mation security he actually comes from

179
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:51,399
kind of an organizational psychology

180
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:57,008
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> cities definition reflects</font>

181
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:59,409
that and here's my definition so I would

182
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:02,490
find behavioral information security as

183
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:05,949
a formal methodology to manage risk

184
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,110
information is derived from knowledge of

185
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:10,569
how humans behave and interact with

186
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,659
information and really what we're after

187
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,509
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my goals for behavioral</font>

188
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:19,479
information security is the second part

189
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:22,449
to design better systems that take

190
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,459
people into account and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

191
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:32,050
interface design for an infosec if you

192
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:34,509
will so why why should we care why

193
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,279
annual information security well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

194
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:38,919
there's a few reasons to care about it

195
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,019
first is they can develop new tools to

196
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">address the people problem that we don't</font>

197
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">have today and also I think it can help</font>

198
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,350
modernize your profession I don't know

199
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,630
if anybody here is Fred the new school

200
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,899
but the new school kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of touches on a</font>

201
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,939
lot of these same kind of issues I think

202
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,279
but the bottom line really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

203
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,529
reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and increase the</font>

204
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,529
effectiveness of information security

205
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:06,120
and if we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we're not</font>

206
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,949
doing your jobs maybe I that we exist to

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,490
support our businesses and it's our job

208
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:18,189
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security we deliver</font>

209
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:21,000
is cost efficient and effective or de

210
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,000
pere face Vader

211
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:41,199
so behavior security<font color="#E5E5E5"> Molly so any</font>

212
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:44,569
questions before we go on great so

213
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:48,339
behavioral security modeling is really

214
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:51,439
primarily a method rather than a model

215
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,480
for describing<font color="#E5E5E5"> security requirements</font>

216
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:58,040
using these ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of behavioral</font>

217
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:00,829
information security so this should look

218
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,480
familiar how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times have you come</font>

219
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:07,189
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> this don't spit as full control</font>

220
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,250
so here's the Senate here's the scenario

221
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:14,629
I just set up a new folder and I want to

222
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">give everyone access well what do I mean</font>

223
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:23,870
when I say everyone do I mean buddy on

224
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:26,629
my team everybody 19 or do I mean

225
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,660
everybody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access this</font>

226
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:32,269
directory even if they're anonymous well

227
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,309
my guess is that I probably don't mean

228
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,959
that last thing on there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

229
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:41,930
exactly what happens when you set this

230
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:43,579
up on flavors so this this problem this

231
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,609
this example points out a couple of

232
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:49,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">things right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the everyone</font>

233
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:52,689
problem is two aspects to this first of

234
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,730
all that what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by everyone and</font>

235
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:58,490
there's a gap between what I wanted and

236
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,740
what I actually got so the desired

237
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,449
outcome actually is when I said everyone

238
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,610
I mean I want to offer eyes all I see

239
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,160
employees

240
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,370
rest of you or read the contents of my

241
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,439
folder what I actually got in fact was

242
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,079
everybody with an account on the system

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,060
now in fact include people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who don't</font>

244
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,250
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a console system but the truth is</font>

245
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,660
on most<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows systems these days you</font>

246
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,890
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an account to get to a</font>

247
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,149
shared folder so we're introducing a

248
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,730
vulnerability here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

249
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:30,540
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between what I wanted and</font>

250
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,100
what I actually got are not the same

251
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,390
then if that creates a vulnerability the

252
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,480
vulnerability in this case is that

253
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that I did not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> authorize to have</font>

254
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to the system or did not intend</font>

255
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to authorize have access to the system</font>

256
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:49,180
now do so behavior security modeling is

257
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,630
a standard methodology for describing

258
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,569
these desire and intended outcomes it's

259
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to describe user intent which is</font>

260
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,279
very important it's useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe</font>

261
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,989
system functionality so you can use this

262
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,480
same technique to describe what's

263
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,760
actually there and this allows us to

264
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,800
analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> that identify gaps between what</font>

265
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:16,060
was desired and what we've actually

266
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,649
built which as I said so ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

267
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,079
we're working towards with behavior

268
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,140
security modeling is improving the

269
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,469
precision of our security requirements

270
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,180
so that we don't introduce the whole

271
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,089
release the first place if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

272
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,269
deliver on the security that people are

273
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:37,930
actually asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for then we'll have more</font>

274
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:42,130
secure systems so there's a few

275
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:44,760
components of the modeling process we

276
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,320
have actors actors are always people

277
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,449
you're not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

278
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,010
natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's because systems don't</font>

279
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,279
operate on their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are always</font>

280
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,230
behind that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attend those from the</font>

281
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,890
people set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system not for the</font>

282
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:04,390
system itself until we have a I actors

283
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,279
water so actors could be individuals

284
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,860
this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in a certain role</font>

285
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,570
life it could be an accountant it could

286
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,040
be specific people it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> bothering</font>

287
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">encounter it can be groups and these</font>

288
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,699
groups are always social groups that

289
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,550
exist within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context of the</font>

290
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:21,630
organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

291
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,699
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just arbitrary</font>

292
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,480
collections of people because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people business people real</font>

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,819
people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do work they don't think</font>

295
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,740
in terms of abstract groupings people

296
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:36,899
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in terms of people in working</font>

297
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,240
with mom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and project for people that are</font>

298
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,389
in my department or something like that

299
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,170
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have objects objects is</font>

300
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:47,880
information this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually held any</font>

301
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,579
information system so what's in the

302
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,430
computers we have actions we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have both</font>

303
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,290
functional actions which are simple

304
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,969
actions which basically amounts to read

305
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,819
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> write ultimately that's what we're</font>

306
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down to we have complex actions</font>

307
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:03,719
these are kind of business driven

308
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,160
activities so I purchase a book I create

309
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,579
an account on the system or something

310
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that and finally on the action</font>

311
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,290
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> actions now these are</font>

312
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,479
specialized actions they're really

313
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,329
relevant to security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a specific</font>

314
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,220
security impact so things like identify

315
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:25,589
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify who you are or</font>

316
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,290
authenticate so prove to me you are who

317
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you say you are authorized so I'm going</font>

318
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,760
to say give somebody permission to do

319
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,680
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform an action we're</font>

320
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,750
delegate which is a more complicated

321
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:42,180
idea so we also have this important idea

322
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,100
of constraints so constraints are

323
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,138
limitations on<font color="#E5E5E5"> actions so you're not</font>

324
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,180
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blank and authorize somebody to</font>

325
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,610
read necessarily you're actually

326
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">constraints on that and that could be</font>

327
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,410
time so you're only allowed to it and

328
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,120
I'm excuse me during business hours or

329
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,660
could be location<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm holding a lot</font>

330
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,480
you do it while<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in the office</font>

331
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">now an important concept in addition to</font>

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,560
its trace is this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it constraints</font>

333
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,750
because when you're talking to people

334
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,420
they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not tell you a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

335
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,120
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want you to put on</font>

336
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,180
constraints so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> implied as soon</font>

337
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,800
there otherwise unstated constraints so

338
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,680
when I say give access to Bob and

339
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Counting I probably don't mean forever I</font>

340
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,959
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

341
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,600
only as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as he's working here as</font>

342
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,160
long as it's appropriate for his job but

343
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say those things</font>

344
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,660
because they just kind of assume that

345
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,459
magically happens now the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news is</font>

346
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">as long as he's working here most</font>

347
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:41,170
companies and figure that out and now

348
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,119
take care of that behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenes but</font>

349
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,120
the second thing doesn't happen isn't it

350
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,589
doesn't happen as much and it's still

351
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,680
problem today for many companies so

352
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:55,449
let's let's actually use this approach

353
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,849
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightweight then look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

354
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,769
specific couple of specific channels

355
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario is sharepoint</font>

356
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:07,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to have access to my</font>

357
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:11,769
SharePoint site okay sounds great how do

358
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:15,579
you all this out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first actor</font>

359
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,230
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> asilomar the actor in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

360
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">gather actors all employees and</font>

361
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,309
contractors now we've actually had a

362
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,870
conversation to figure it out when I say

363
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:25,360
everyone I mean all employees and

364
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,790
contractors it's everybody working for

365
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,610
the company the security action here is

366
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,980
authorized<font color="#CCCCCC"> and authorizing a functional</font>

367
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,329
action to happen the functional action

368
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,800
is read object is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint site and</font>

369
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the constraints I really want this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

370
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,729
work this is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

371
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,920
two sites to SharePoint sites one

372
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,439
internal and external and I want this to

373
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,599
be on the internal site and there's a

374
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:51,219
hidden constraint here as well that I

375
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,139
probably don't specifically call out

376
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,939
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is only for current</font>

377
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">employees and contractors that they</font>

378
00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:02,050
leave the company I don't want them to

379
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:05,880
have access anymore so how do i set this

380
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:09,490
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sharepoint has this great feature</font>

381
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,929
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicated users group that</font>

382
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,220
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everybody the company-wide I</font>

383
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:17,559
just use that so there's a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

384
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,870
who who is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unauthenticated users</font>

385
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just all</font>

386
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,369
employees and contractors includes

387
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,370
anybody with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> login to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system so</font>

388
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:29,860
that that could be vendors you know just

389
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,928
random you know random<font color="#E5E5E5"> contractors are</font>

390
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,969
really aren't you know just kind

391
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,559
specialized contractors who don't take

392
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,919
place and kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal day to day</font>

393
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,009
activity than thinking of so there's

394
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,330
possible fix for this instead of

395
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">SharePoint presenting me the option to</font>

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,019
present a list socially relevant groups

for me to choose from so<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead I say</font>

400
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,269
hey what what group would you like to be

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i'm saying what i'm saying</font>

408
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,330
that maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and in fact as an</font>

409
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:21,330
organization we might decide that that's

410
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,470
too risky for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use so we're not</font>

411
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,480
gonna let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we're actually</font>

412
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,629
going to take that off the list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,789
a policy that says and not allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

414
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:32,248
grant that because there aren't really

any normal circumstances where that

416
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:41,249
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be appropriate so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SharePoint again</font>

417
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:43,830
as I love to pick on<font color="#CCCCCC"> SharePoint it's a</font>

418
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:46,830
great tool with fantastic security that

419
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,658
really gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> as very well managed in most</font>

420
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:53,840
cases since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never seen a poorly</font>

421
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:58,950
managed security of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint so Alice</font>

422
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,080
she works at Bob alice is a marketing

423
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,899
employee that I'm working with my

424
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-month project and she requests</font>

425
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:11,719
access to my study pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> star in</font>

426
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,190
so I'm actually won a grand<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice access</font>

427
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,210
so how does that break down in terms of

428
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,820
modeling well I mind the actor I'm a

429
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,049
site owner Ellis is the other actions in

430
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,629
this case I'm actually thinking about

431
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,309
Alice specifically because it's not

432
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:29,100
unique to her role she just happens to

be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my project the security</font>

authorizing her to read my SharePoint

436

00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:40,130
SharePoint site so we're

438
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,200
into that and here's the hidden

439
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,780
strengths which are important what I

440
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,760
don't say but what I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is I</font>

441
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really only want to grant Ellis access</font>

442
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,900
for the duration of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> project and</font>

443
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,260
only if alice is still in her current

444
00:19:50,900 --> 00:20:00,250
job and only if she's employed with the

445
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:04,220
company so what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens well</font>

446
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:06,110
sharepoint says me an email very helpful

447
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,370
very helpful that way says here click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

448
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:12,320
this link to grant Alice access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

449
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,449
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem there's no time limit I</font>

450
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,290
don't think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I never take</font>

451
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,300
our anti-sway so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a possible</font>

452
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,889
solution of this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love</font>

453
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,149
with Microsoft could actually implement

454
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,680
these things by the way I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it make</font>

455
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a much more much more effective</font>

456
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:32,690
product I actually asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> limits</font>

457
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:35,540
so the system asks me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long Chanel us</font>

458
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:39,980
have access to your site for some number

459
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:41,470
of months right indefinitely as long as

460
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,400
she's in her current position or

461
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:47,210
indefinitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as she's here at</font>

462
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,470
the company again the last two may or

463
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,990
may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate for your</font>

464
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,960
organization you know we might actually

465
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,850
say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one no you know if she</font>

466
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,590
changes positions she's got to get new

467
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:01,250
access so she changes positions the

468
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:03,020
access on that this way one of the nice

469
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,630
things is if you actually eliminate

470
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,220
those last two options organizationally

471
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">does something clever you've actually</font>

472
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,710
forced people into doing periodic

473
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,689
reviews of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SharePoint actions you can</font>

474
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,910
sniff I can only grant people access for

475
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,130
a limited period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font>

476
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,410
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reviewing their</font>

477
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,820
access somehow hopefully the system will

478
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,310
actually send you friendly reminder

479
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,409
saying hey this purse is access is about

480
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,960
to expire which like to extend their

481
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,660
access I say yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it says for how</font>

482
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,690
long I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 ornaments a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

483
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">extra work but it forces those your</font>

484
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:42,740
views again building system with people

485
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,470
in mind so that it becomes easy for them

486
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,549
to do

487
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,020
security so this gives the meat of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

488
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:51,879
talk let's talk about something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

489
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,429
have a lot of love for that's credit

490
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,020
cards credit cards definitely designed

491
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,850
the security in mind and definitely

492
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,740
designed with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet mind clearly</font>

493
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,399
because we have no issues with credit

494
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:06,610
card payments today so credit card

495
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,559
payments we have we have three people

496
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,240
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the transaction at least as</font>

497
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,940
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Minnetonka pots data is really a</font>

498
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,919
few more really focus on these three

499
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:19,570
there's the customer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> merchant and</font>

500
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,789
the processor one that makes money

501
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,820
happen so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people behind</font>

502
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:28,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> processor rogue and skipper and</font>

503
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:30,309
really we're going to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so so</font>

504
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,990
here's this from the customers story the

505
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:34,990
customer wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy something the</font>

506
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,659
customer wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy an ipod nano and</font>

507
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,200
says here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can authorize you merchant</font>

508
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:43,630
to take $149 for my account in return

509
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you give me an iPod</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano so they</font>

510
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,130
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide an authorization token</font>

511
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:49,960
this is the card number<font color="#E5E5E5"> expiration date</font>

512
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:55,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all the other good things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

513
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,980
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the card work so what is</font>

514
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the authorization token so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

515
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a detour so this is</font>

516
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,059
something else that's important for

517
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,970
modeling security tokens as i am using

518
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:10,330
them here our bundles of information

519
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:13,240
that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are representative of what</font>

520
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:16,149
you're trying to do so the token has all

521
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,080
the data needed to carry out the

522
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:22,750
security action within computer system

523
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,980
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in this case we have an</font>

524
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication token the authentication</font>

525
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,600
something has everything you need excuse

526
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,010
me authorization token the authorization

527
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,559
token has everything you need to

528
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">authorize payment on that credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font>

529
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,330
you could have an identification<font color="#E5E5E5"> tonin</font>

530
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,399
username is a great example of

531
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,460
this you can have an authentication

532
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,980
token you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a password</font>

533
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,440
or you could actually have a hard token

534
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:53,080
yet another use of the word token like

535
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,840
an RSA children same rhythms so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

536
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,159
the custom role model look like so who

537
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,320
are the actors any one individual

538
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,040
individual customer yes who's the other

539
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,429
actor merchant merchant<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's the</font>

540
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,500
security actually physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> card is that</font>

541
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,060
physical card visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ricardo what's the</font>

542
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,910
security action what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we trying to</font>

543
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,800
your intention either i sired that is

544
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:23,860
correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the functional</font>

545
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:29,379
action the purchase<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving the</font>

546
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:36,070
payment exactly and the object what are

547
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:38,380
we operating on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a trick</font>

548
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,929
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to one bunker what is</font>

549
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,280
the customer account and really one is

550
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,660
the version<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't oh sorry so for</font>

551
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,430
those of you have fast guys who saw the

552
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,060
answer so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the constraints here</font>

553
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:54,610
this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> important point all</font>

554
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:58,300
we're figure $149 its operator you got

555
00:24:54,610 --> 00:25:01,959
what else fine sorry the item or service

556
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:04,060
yeah yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part of it so the</font>

557
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,380
item should only be exchanged if that

558
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:12,000
money is authorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takedown yeah so</font>

559
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:18,220
who did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> who did i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> authorized them</font>

560
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,950
versus right so this is $149 for one

561
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,040
transaction only between the customer

562
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:27,370
and the virgin so again these these are

563
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,050
hard so I'm dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

564
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,639
hitting strains here just assuming we

565
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,800
figure those all out that's part of the

566
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,410
challenge figuring out what are the

567
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,629
assumptions built into the constraints

568
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,980
of that model so what are the

569
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,610
constraints that is probably the

570
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,720
trickiest part met doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

571
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:47,000
thank you so and we have a token token

572
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,549
is the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> number and the rest of your</font>

573
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:57,920
authorization so so we have a person

574
00:25:52,549 --> 00:26:00,889
their story is similar they receive the

575
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:05,240
authorization token they delegate the

576
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:07,340
transfer of $149 and the store the card

577
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,140
number as identification something you

578
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,490
know for marketing purposes so they can

579
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,150
serve the customer better no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

580
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason and finally they provide that</font>

581
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,280
authorization token to the processor and

582
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,280
of course send the send a product line

583
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,649
to the customer so how do we model that

584
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,668
out so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> axle actually before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

585
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,070
forward there's actually two things

586
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,040
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here first is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the version</font>

587
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,110
is delegating a transfer of money and

588
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second thing is separate action</font>

589
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,830
they're actually storing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> harbors</font>

590
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're doing two things you know you</font>

591
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,678
get one transaction with custom YouTube

592
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,980
you get two on the version so the first

593
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:49,790
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the delegation of the payments</font>

594
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:54,890
and who are the average first<font color="#E5E5E5"> act any</font>

595
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:57,889
one person second actor processor what's

596
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:02,480
the security action just said delegated

597
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:04,600
what's the functional action<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3mon three</font>

598
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,270
school transfer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money you got it and</font>

599
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,678
the objects obviously customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> inversion</font>

600
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:16,129
accounts and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the constraints</font>

601
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,799
and be changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we haven't used it</font>

602
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:21,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">still the same we have $149 one</font>

603
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,250
transaction only between the customer

604
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:28,070
and the merchant and finally token same

605
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:33,140
time that we passed from the customer to

606
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:36,559
the merchant so save save you all some

607
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,330
time and agony just go ahead and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

608
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,750
the book the second thing immersion is

609
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:45,379
doing the merchant is identifying a

610
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,270
customer they're storing an object<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

611
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,870
object that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're storing is a card</font>

612
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,200
number that's the identity

613
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,669
identification token and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transaction</font>

614
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,890
fee fell so they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the customer</font>

615
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,720
wants so they can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw up the</font>

616
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,850
right right ads and they come up to the

617
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,440
website again the next time there's

618
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,600
really no constraints here because I

619
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,190
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care I mean I just say this I want</font>

620
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,199
anybody my company be able to see this

621
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,600
you know who<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares it that will get a</font>

622
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,670
card number right and of course the

623
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,169
token here is the card number saying

624
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:19,770
anybody see problems with this yeah so

625
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,960
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the processor they</font>

626
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,760
received the authentication token they

627
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,900
verify the authorization with the

628
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,720
customers bank they actually

629
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,610
authenticate I said authentication two

630
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,160
minutes wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> line to fix that they</font>

631
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,229
receive the authorization so again and

632
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,420
they verify it with the customers bank

633
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,429
that is an authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> process you're</font>

634
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,720
authenticating the authorization token

635
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:44,100
they transfer $149 and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

636
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,170
take the three dollar cut which is

637
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,230
typical for a transaction that sighs I'm

638
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:52,350
cold and of course pay visa because

639
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lisa's got to get their kind to so we're</font>

640
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,800
actually not going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

641
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,070
processor<font color="#E5E5E5"> today because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Schmidt</font>

642
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep focusing on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> merchant so we have</font>

643
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:07,740
some gas here so the first gap anybody

644
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,580
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first gap has to do with the</font>

645
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,580
constraints

646
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,039
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're talking four of us so</font>

647
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,990
they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisa what you said was that</font>

648
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,590
the security of the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

649
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,940
merchant stores it is insecure yeah

650
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,939
that's that's the second one yeah

651
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,440
exactly that is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem via</font>

652
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,750
dedication to achieving the optimization

653
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,299
token is not constrained eat into a

654
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,039
fixed amount or to a specific

655
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:46,539
transaction we've actually violated

656
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,400
those constraints a customer only

657
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended for this card number to be</font>

658
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">using this one time for this one amount</font>

659
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,990
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not what they actually</font>

660
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,730
passed it's not their fault but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

661
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,919
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that token is vulnerable to theft</font>

662
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,539
so if you have all the authorization

663
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,640
information you need for credit card

664
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:05,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">transaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

665
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,890
possess that you can make a transaction

666
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:10,029
any merchant anywhere in the world and

667
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,760
probably get money out of the plane

668
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:15,340
easily so hence the value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the credit</font>

669
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,620
card numbers on the black market the

670
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,899
second thing we also heard which is that

671
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,520
the identification token contains

672
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,840
authorization data that's really what's

673
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,039
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so when I store their</font>

674
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,139
credit card number for marketing

675
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:31,029
purposes I have failed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to properly</font>

676
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,970
that's a reuse or misuse of tokens right

677
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:36,760
so I have an authorization token now I'm

678
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,710
repurposing it as identification guess

679
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,090
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowed to do that</font>

680
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,649
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again introduces</font>

681
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,480
vulnerabilities because that token

682
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,639
although it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

683
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,190
authorization data there is still

684
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,730
someone valuable and vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to theft</font>

685
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,710
and plus as anybody who is dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

686
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,080
credit card numbers knows it's also

687
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,520
something at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pc out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her will PCI</font>

688
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,779
auditor will go after right away so so

689
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,029
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about fixing it well</font>

690
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:06,100
there's some interesting things to be

691
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,470
said about<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the customer they don't</font>

692
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,408
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean the reality is that</font>

693
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:13,659
the misuse possible nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by law</font>

694
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a credit card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their living is 50</font>

695
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:21,159
bucks and in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's zero</font>

696
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,820
dollars now there's obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

697
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,960
hassle involved here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

698
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,149
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care and there's not</font>

699
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,860
much they can do anyway so the process

700
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:29,750
are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about what the</font>

701
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,379
solution they would want day but

702
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:35,960
basically what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would push for is a</font>

703
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:38,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-time-use authorization token of some</font>

704
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,880
kind tied to the signal transaction so

705
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,269
they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about storing</font>

706
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,809
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that authorization data in their</font>

707
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:49,880
systems and the mercy has the most

708
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:52,009
difficult question is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

709
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,590
properly constrain an authorization

710
00:31:52,009 --> 00:32:00,440
token and also use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an identifier</font>

711
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:02,449
so there's a number of payment security

712
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,750
solutions out there on the market today

713
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,730
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people call this a tokenization</font>

714
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,909
again just confuse everybody and get

715
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,980
another way to talk about tokens so

716
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:14,690
basically how this work it works and

717
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,399
looked at a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them they all work</font>

718
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,899
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way the merchant</font>

719
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,939
when they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authorization</font>

720
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,739
information they sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the Gateway</font>

721
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,799
the Gateway is even a third party

722
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,840
provider or the processor they take that

723
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">information they store it and they send</font>

724
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,279
back a<font color="#E5E5E5"> special number called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tobit that</font>

725
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:34,489
is not a credit card number not valid as

726
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,200
a credit card number but identifies you

727
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,350
to that card for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one transaction</font>

728
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,360
for multiple transactions in some cases

729
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gateway actually gets the it's the</font>

730
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,389
authorization info the card info

731
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly from the customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

732
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:47,539
Virgin never has to touch it this

733
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:51,710
actually reduces merchants risk even

734
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:54,769
further so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one time you</font>

735
00:32:51,710 --> 00:33:00,889
so consumed ulti use tokens depending on

736
00:32:54,769 --> 00:33:03,500
what how it works so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is after</font>

737
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:05,350
you get token<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's usable after that for</font>

738
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,000
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the payment cycle</font>

739
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">complete the settlements and any</font>

740
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,419
disputes and all that sort of thing so

741
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:17,979
so looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those solutions how do</font>

742
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:21,590
they fix our gaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time tokens</font>

743
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:24,350
comes pretty close it<font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfies the</font>

744
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:27,230
constraints baby yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for one</font>

745
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:31,090
transactional late yes it's between the

746
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:34,120
customer and merchant yes maybe 149 not

747
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:37,290
not sure but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the</font>

748
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,479
emergence need to store identification

749
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-use tokens this partially</font>

750
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,930
satisfies the constraint so really only

751
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,719
satisfies one which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

752
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:48,940
customer and merchant and it does meet

753
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,800
the merchant feed store<font color="#E5E5E5"> identification</font>

754
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,010
token it still doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve all the</font>

755
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,680
problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with both of these we</font>

756
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:58,510
still have gaps in the first case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

757
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,040
constraints are<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully meant or maybe</font>

758
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,830
they are from one-time tokens but even

759
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,260
that case then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't identify the</font>

760
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:07,120
customer and we also have another

761
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem where we having again mixed up</font>

762
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,359
mixed use tokens we're using an

763
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,150
authorization token for identification

764
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,890
again you shouldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

765
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">today as least as far as I know there</font>

766
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:22,299
isn't a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that meets all the</font>

767
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:25,959
requirements so here's a possible

768
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:28,690
solution that our model suggests if we

769
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">generated two tokens instead of one we</font>

770
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,840
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually fix this problem so we have</font>

771
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:36,639
a one time you saw opportunity

772
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,640
authorization token that's cabs in our

773
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,920
payment system and we have a unique

774
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,080
identification token generator at the

775
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,060
same time it's important that this

776
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,250
identification fo can be not valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

777
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,960
payment and not reversible so we have

778
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,580
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> that uniquely identifies the</font>

779
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,860
credit card number that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

780
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,889
change back so we know that we're

781
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting the authorization data saved and</font>

782
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,180
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the identification that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

783
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,280
want this actually satisfies all of our

784
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,990
constraints one transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> only between</font>

785
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,570
the customer and merchant or suing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

786
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:12,419
implemented properly and it meets the

787
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:17,200
need destroyed the hero security monitor

788
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,850
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say people-centric</font>

789
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,730
method for describing security

790
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:24,190
requirements or implementations it

791
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,110
removes the ambiguity we have a social

792
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:30,220
groups and makes those untreated

793
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:32,290
unstated constraints explicit and really

794
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,750
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that you</font>

795
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,570
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build better systems because they be</font>

796
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:42,430
behave as expected fewer vulnerabilities

797
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:43,619
better security so future direction is

798
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,049
where we going with this next

799
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:49,170
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just enough to whet your</font>

800
00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:50,640
appetite hopefully so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one in</font>

801
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,859
two months hopefully I'll be coming out

802
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,890
with a white paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> that describes this</font>

803
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,170
process in more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at</font>

804
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:02,368
the website or or follow me on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

805
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:05,029
for news on that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as I as they</font>

806
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:08,069
use this and practice which i plan to do

807
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:11,339
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and refine the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> catalogue of the</font>

808
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">actors especially the security functions</font>

809
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:15,960
and the constraints so that people have

810
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to work with a catalog and</font>

811
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,529
helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> them do their jobs when they're</font>

812
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,499
sitting down people getting security

813
00:36:19,529 --> 00:36:24,240
requirements trade programs eventually

814
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:25,769
if it gets the mystic ate enough we

815
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,519
could do that trade people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how this</font>

816
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:31,258
works and finally a uml based modeling

817
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,288
template there is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

818
00:36:31,259 --> 00:36:36,690
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure you amount that i plan to</font>

819
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:39,059
extend just with a little bit with a few

820
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,809
tweaks and actually used if you want to

821
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:43,980
do formal uml processing so future

822
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:47,819
directions for behavioral information

823
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,460
security design principles and working

824
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:51,779
on them a taxonomy of user behaviors

825
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,670
there's already we're starting on this

826
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">jeffs and did that get in three years of</font>

827
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:59,309
research but the ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal really is</font>

828
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:04,379
to develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> full practice with these</font>

829
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:06,599
principles in line so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll throw up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

830
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,789
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources references on the screen</font>

831
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,339
these will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides I'll post it to</font>

832
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,809
the site there's actually a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

833
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:14,819
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about these types of</font>

834
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and here's some talks that I've</font>

835
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:21,049
recently attended that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

836
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">about thinking about the person and</font>

837
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:28,890
using that to do better security so I i

838
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,129
want to mention this<font color="#E5E5E5"> book also this is</font>

839
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,319
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice boy is the summation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

840
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,210
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years of research i would</font>

841
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it as reading if for nothing</font>

842
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:42,900
else to read actual interviews with

843
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:45,119
people talking about their attitudes

844
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,980
about security so people you probably

845
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,680
don't normally talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

846
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't tell you</font>

847
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,669
things to your face talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

848
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,890
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel about security this book is</font>

849
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:56,559
the study I think was done a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years</font>

850
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,900
ago it was done in the two thousand

851
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,280
early 2000s so it's a little out of data

852
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,780
that I don't think people's attitudes

853
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,780
change that lunch
