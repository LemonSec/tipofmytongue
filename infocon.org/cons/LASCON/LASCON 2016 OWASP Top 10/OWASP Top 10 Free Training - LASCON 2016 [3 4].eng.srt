a number of other conferences all over

43
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,820
the place and it was right after I had

44
00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:00,220
attended<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece on Las Vegas</font>

black hat back in 2010 and for me what I

46
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:08,980
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize was that this is more</font>

47
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,319
information security access gloss is

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,499
more than just a show up learn something

49
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,450
after dusting of your day job for me

50
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:21,260
this was really about establishing

51
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,349
community and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I when I became</font>

52
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,649
president the old Austin chapter one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

53
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,409
my key areas i focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do i</font>

54
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,480
strengthen relationships between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

55
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:34,548
two developers between the information

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,069
security people between otters and how

57
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,049
do i vs all together and start talking

58
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,869
the same language and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

59
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,030
from each other and so last con really

60
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,579
was founded on on that goal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

61
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,859
a way to get the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together</font>

62
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:51,709
in one place we can talk a common

63
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,409
language we can learn from each other so

64
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,090
I really hope that if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

plans on thursday and friday to do

journey continue with our journey

through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OWASP top ten the next one</font>

87
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:58,039
up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more in strict object reference so</font>

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,719
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Easter direct object</font>

89
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,210
reference

90

developer exposes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference to an</font>

91
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,130
internal inhuman tation object like I

<font color="#E5E5E5">love the directory or deadly scheme and</font>

then without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tour access control</font>

94
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,760
channels to make sure that the user

95
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,700
accessing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

96
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,710
able to get at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or some other form</font>

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,900
of protection the attackers can then

98
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,870
manipulate those references to access

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:29,169
things they're not supposed assets

100
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:32,980
unauthorized<font color="#E5E5E5"> attagirl so the attackers</font>

101
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,470
water this is not going to be as

102
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,500
significant as like the sequel objection

103
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,120
were two straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> up old data database</font>

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,670
but he's kind of lost and compromise the

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,890
data that's records by that brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> new so</font>

106
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,620
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more scope but it's</font>

107
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,380
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty serious unless the object</font>

108
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,180
references are unpredictable that it's

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,360
easy for attacker taxes all the

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,190
available data of that time and this is

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,020
really where things like the ORM tools

112
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,820
kind of come handy because they're

113
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,090
basically creating a situation where

114
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,280
those those preferences are highly

115
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,960
unpredictable or they're strongly tied

116
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,090
to it it's fun for difficult for

117
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,580
attacker to to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> complications like</font>

118
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in order to really determine the</font>

119
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,780
impact here we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the</font>

120
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,789
business value<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expose data as both</font>

121
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of the public</font>

122
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:24,580
exposure is vulnerability and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

123
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">be kind of a theme for most of these</font>

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">because after all data is king and our</font>

125
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:35,020
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact is really good depend on the</font>

126
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,080
type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that gets exposed so here's</font>

127
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:41,010
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of this as</font>

128
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,380
like a banking application everything

129
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,340
baking is just so cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> right if all this</font>

130
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,510
money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PII</font>

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,219
account information that that's just

132
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,010
staying there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe for the picking</font>

133
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,870
lesson sort of attack I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font>

134
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,360
this as something like that where you've

135
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,310
got these statements right and the

136
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,560
statements are lined up nor from

137
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,100
mortgage well excuse rs.12 statements

138
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,400
under there

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,680
and so in the normal use of this

140
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">application we would have something like</font>

141
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,780
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view statement in my safety is</font>

142
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:20,380
number 40 right what happens now if as a

143
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:23,679
malicious person I say come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on 17</font>

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,560
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of three but the users only</font>

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,320
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have access 1 for 12 so now</font>

146
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,890
they're asking for 17 wolf 17 exists and

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,820
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a check in place that says</font>

148
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,820
this user can only access 1 for 12 now

149
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,480
that users game number 17 right and they

150
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:46,390
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> access 418 number 0 whatever the</font>

151
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,120
case may be um as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as we don't come</font>

152
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,099
any sort of restrictions provisions

153
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,450
remaining the masses in that that's

154
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,820
where we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem so testing</font>

155
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,180
applications for this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

156
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate again and again this has to</font>

157
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,370
do with the context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are scaling</font>

158
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,860
tools running they don't know what data

159
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,660
the user should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to and</font>

160
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,700
because they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the users</font>

161
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,010
have access to and they can go through

162
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:18,070
they can say i equals 4 on to entry for

163
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,920
all we have 200 whatever the case may be

164
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,180
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless there's some way saying yes</font>

165
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,220
that's something they should have access

166
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know that something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they should this</font>

167
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just a logic issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so that's</font>

168
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">why this is really really hard for us</font>

169
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">automated but it's very important for us</font>

170
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,770
to test and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do this is</font>

171
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,349
we inspect the parameters that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed</font>

172
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,059
the application we then manipulate those

173
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,400
parameters to see if we can get it to

174
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,920
display something<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

175
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,870
expect a display and then we look at the

176
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,569
pages whose only purpose is to display

177
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,350
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> dosing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot so doc Mimms</font>

178
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:56,170
account statements no I guess give you

179
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,080
guys a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a story that I like</font>

180
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,819
to use

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,860
training class what I'm talking with

182
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers start from way back when</font>

183
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,050
there was a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this company</font>

184
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,860
their job was to put information on this

185
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,990
website having to do with Peleus

186
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,650
earnings announcements from the company

187
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:21,020
and new stocks that I or things like

188
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,050
that and what would happen is the

189
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,370
company before the official time that

190
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,040
the press release was supposed to go out

191
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,530
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically q these documents up and</font>

192
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,099
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they go and write their</font>

193
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:35,630
little heart of emphasis and then they

194
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,000
publish that publish atmosphere<font color="#E5E5E5"> sake</font>

195
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,680
well when they send publish what the

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,860
system would do is it would basically

197
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,380
create a preference for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IV it maybe</font>

198
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,050
it's a date that is referencing

199
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,510
something like that but once I

200
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,790
references in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system then you could</font>

201
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,460
actually go even if they did publish<font color="#CCCCCC"> li</font>

202
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,770
an actual link to that somebody thank

203
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,120
you where to go could basically get like

204
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,579
that page and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see all the news</font>

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,040
information for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and what I am</font>

206
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,930
happening is there were some of who

207
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:11,329
called entrepreneurs who decided that

208
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,489
figure this the scheme out right and

209
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,470
they figure out that on any day they

210
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,270
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically plug in that date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

211
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,540
can see the news even if it's not

212
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,189
published in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was there and so</font>

213
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,170
will they figure this out they actually

214
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to do stop training based on that</font>

215
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,979
information and so they were able to say

216
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,320
hey this entry's announcement is down

217
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,210
the shore that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped for this company</font>

218
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,760
is earning is an announcement give way

219
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,290
way over what they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> projecting let's</font>

220
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,810
buy a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this right because the</font>

221
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">process can go up and I believe that</font>

222
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">those guys actually got charged with</font>

223
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem as a result of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because they</font>

224
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,520
were trading with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the insider knowledge</font>

225
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,790
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> bless you here we want to protect</font>

226
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information</font>

227
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,670
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody should have</font>

228
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,500
access to we need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

229
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,719
we're treating me as sensitive and that

230
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,680
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for restricting permissions to</font>

231
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,750
access to that so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well</font>

232
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,030
automate some sort of exploitation here

233
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">in let's say it's like that statement</font>

234
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,689
thing where the vulnerable parameter is

235
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,479
incrementing enter 1234 release right I

236
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,440
just say hey here's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice starts at</font>

237
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,450
zero and I won't move for forever and I

238
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,460
want you to get this page this is the

239
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,770
parameter that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in so in</font>

240
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,570
this case the answer value and then I

241
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">want you to test page and see what value</font>

242
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,040
you get back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then receive and so</font>

243
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,660
will stand up happening is this test

244
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,219
page is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run over and over and</font>

245
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,260
over you should the different values

246
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,600
that come in in this case is kill Duke

247
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,400
to infinity and then three more days

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,140
can't capture whatever that is it is

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,069
Erica we want to see if that's a

250
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,610
200-page<font color="#CCCCCC"> meaning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the pages there it</font>

251
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:53,850
was a success<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 400 air being the valve</font>

252
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,190
maybe I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture the size because</font>

253
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,230
the sizes of the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the paper turn</font>

254
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,530
is addictive of the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

255
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's coming back to me my name is I</font>

256
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,829
can use this to kind of go through in

257
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,979
one off go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all values a kind of</font>

258
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,750
funny story around this<font color="#E5E5E5"> matt to star was</font>

259
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,790
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> walker other three classes here</font>

260
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:20,610
he's down an employee of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ool</font>

261
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:25,589
foundation and back in Los a was Tony me

262
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 I was in Washington DC with him for</font>

263
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the O's conference and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> staying</font>

264
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,860
at the hotel and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotel basically</font>

265
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,870
used to things<font color="#CCCCCC"> south and in case their</font>

266
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,060
wives well their wireless is a game

267
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,710
feature so you had to basically paid in

268
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,599
order to give

269
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:48,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hotel it require two things require</font>

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,930
your room number and your last night and

271
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,930
Matt knew that there were a number of

272
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,109
other boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> board members that were</font>

273
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,939
staying at this hotel so we knew their

274
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,580
last names it's a good place to start

275
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,970
and the hotel only<font color="#E5E5E5"> had so many girls</font>

276
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,760
right so we can basically go and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

277
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:11,510
say our let's try the wireless with last

278
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,460
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cruz dinners cruises one of the</font>

279
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">four different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time or chat</font>

280
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,680
Williams or whatever and then let's loop

281
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,689
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> presume zero cruising more in prison</font>

282
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be all the way up to over the biggest</font>

283
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">room numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well it didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take long</font>

284
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,660
and overweight field 964 member seven

285
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,910
board members so it didn't take a long

286
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,860
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Matt to look through those and</font>

287
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,920
find a combination with this blasting

288
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,370
plus this room number equals now I have

289
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,390
a year in taxes so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font>

290
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:47,720
things that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect me most</font>

291
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,760
people that some agents for this the

292
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,860
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing suppose control keys or</font>

293
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,819
identifiers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have things that</font>

294
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of intervals the application</font>

295
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,680
you know some account ideas or things

296
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,660
like that we should try<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to expose</font>

297
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,459
those to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used so we need to create</font>

298
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,860
random identifies and things like that

299
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and by using the random identifiers that</font>

300
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,120
means that an attacker you know they're

301
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,740
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna be able to guess what</font>

302
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value should be you're only going to</font>

303
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,740
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able get this value this value or</font>

304
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,100
this value because

305
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,480
prideth present the other thing that we

306
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,790
can do here is we can use object

307
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,270
references they're challenging to get so

308
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,880
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> GU ID for example is a randomizer</font>

309
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,910
entire it's something that you couldn't

310
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,400
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that value is and we can use</font>

311
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,980
that to track whatever it is over

312
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,140
contract and then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll interior</font>

313
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,360
is performing server-side authorization

314
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,340
chefs project access this is really

315
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,430
probably the most important thing which

316
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,710
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we can try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do this kind of</font>

317
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,569
security through obscurity thing by

318
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,630
randomizing the values of their getting

319
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,400
use to access it and you hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

320
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,770
nobody guess is a tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't waste able</font>

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,870
to enforce those values but really the

<font color="#E5E5E5">way handle this is to say your long game</font>

323
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,160
with this account you have access to you

324
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,079
say is only these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and if you</font>

325
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,060
request anything other than that we're

326
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,890
going to night that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

327
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we want games so to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recap Instagram</font>

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,890
we notice those intro music identifiers

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,680
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use object references that</font>

challenging guest rating values and we

335
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">performed servers on authorization</font>

337
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:42,010
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so there's some references</font>

338
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,010
and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to mr. Cornell</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

342
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,010
so to talk a little bit about security

343
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:22,739
miss configuration and this is something

344
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've touched on a lot of things</font>

345
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've touched on this in a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

346
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,439
areas we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about these privileged</font>

347
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk but that's in depth and those</font>

348
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:36,660
are topics that have come up along the

349
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:39,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">way and other vulnerabilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be</font>

350
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,860
covering<font color="#E5E5E5"> some familiar ground and a</font>

351
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,870
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific structure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

352
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,520
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also something that I think</font>

353
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing become more important as</font>

354
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,470
organizations move toward DevOps how

355
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,140
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here doing DevOps how people</font>

356
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,850
are doing get off right now right so if

357
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,330
anybody'd appoint go to brush your head

358
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:05,069
up that's it allows this is all get out

359
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:08,819
but it's long been a problem that we've

360
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,399
seen in organizations where they deploy

361
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,678
applications into environments that have

362
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,920
for security configurations and in just

363
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,630
for security practices in general and

364
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,579
what we've seen in a lot of

365
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,319
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toward a</font>

366
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,459
lost is that's a great chance to get

367
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">something right there may be getting</font>

368
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,210
wrong before but it's also a great

369
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to get stuff really really</font>

370
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,980
wrong I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our director</font>

371
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:39,090
technology and he was lamenting that

372
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,010
with the wide adoption of object

373
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,470
relational mapping systems every

374
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,360
developer not next<font color="#E5E5E5"> ferry deviate right</font>

375
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,730
and thinks the traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> dda's we do</font>

376
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,370
like make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> your cables are properly</font>

377
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,650
normalized<font color="#E5E5E5"> and next things and whatnot a</font>

378
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,389
lot of those get ignored until you have

379
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,820
got formal problems until they could do

380
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,740
late that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we're seeing now that</font>

381
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,600
the infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that applications</font>

382
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,880
gets deployed on is now controlled by

383
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,610
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or developers now a junior</font>

384
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,269
sis has been with their doctors and

385
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,699
their software-defined networking

386
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:12,440
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in organizations</font>

387
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,479
where you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to make transitions</font>

388
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,639
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doppler that lost type of all types</font>

389
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:20,179
of approaches that's a great opportunity

390
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:23,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some of these good practices in</font>

391
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:28,009
place so what we do is our about

392
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:29,749
security miss configuration so the

393
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:32,509
security is not just that the security

394
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:35,899
the system is not just controlled by the

395
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:39,169
application good security means that you

396
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:41,178
have your application well written from

397
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:43,459
a security standpoint but it also means

398
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have your frame horse configured in</font>

399
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:46,909
a secure manner that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your</font>

400
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,939
application server your web server

401
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:53,779
database server configured in a secure

402
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,239
manner as an attacker I don't have I

403
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,609
don't have a need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

404
00:18:56,239 --> 00:19:00,919
via sequel injection or I have a need

405
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:03,349
for your data if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data made a</font>

406
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,309
sequel injection that's great if I get

407
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:08,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that data by using metasploit off the</font>

408
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,700
database server box and I just pulled a

409
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,249
bit over there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally fine too</font>

410
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,499
and so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand that</font>

411
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:17,539
these applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're writing get</font>

412
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:19,489
deployed on to an infrastructure that

413
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,099
potentially has or that lightly has

414
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:24,799
vulnerabilities and that at the end of

415
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:27,468
the day it's the least secure link or

416
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">orderly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or any secure link in the chain</font>

417
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:33,940
is going to be acceptable to attacker as

418
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:38,749
an attack vector for them to get into

419
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:41,359
and so when you look at deploying<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

420
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:44,749
code you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the security</font>

421
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,789
settings and how those are implemented

422
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:48,859
when you first<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system and but</font>

423
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:52,729
also how they're maintained as the

424
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:54,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">system matures and evolves over time now</font>

425
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:57,019
and also we'll talk specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

426
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone a little bit more as well but you</font>

427
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,369
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software it needs to be</font>

428
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:04,099
kept up to date that's the the cool

429
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,079
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security is that it is</font>

430
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">always changing right here you're</font>

431
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,230
fighting a human adversary and you

432
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:12,120
adversaries are going to adapt get

433
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,800
better over time as a security

434
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,620
consultant that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

435
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,389
a job as a software developer it means

436
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,219
that unfortunately or is it person who's

437
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,690
appealing systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also unfortunately</font>

438
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,760
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's always going to be</font>

439
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,090
stuff to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright they're never going</font>

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,680
to undiscovered vulnerabilities in the

441
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,600
linux version you're running they're

442
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,850
going to discover more vulnerabilities

443
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux that you're up</font>

444
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,159
and so you need to keep things up to

445
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,350
date so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact here again is because</font>

446
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,660
modern these could be you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

447
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,850
really really bad problems that lead to

448
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,090
serious<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stayed up you could also have</font>

449
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,060
an impact where it's more of information

450
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,620
leakage in things of that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

451
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,290
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again need to pay</font>

452
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,959

00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,700
can allow their<font color="#E5E5E5"> completed two pretty</font>

456
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,430

infrastructure pull the data off slick

459
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,180
it and start over again because they had

extent that compromises the only real

462
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:22,170
solution was burn it all down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start</font>

463
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,490
over again so are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mull neural with</font>

causes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> or should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in a position</font>

469
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,810
you've got operating systems that are

470
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,540
running all of these various<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

471
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,810
you've got your web and or application

server you've got your database plus you

473

have the applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've</font>

application do the stuff that it is

477
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,650
supposed to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so a question is how</font>

478
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,930
are you planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep track of</font>

479
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:02,220
whether or not these systems are out of

date mailing list you have patching and

481
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,040
other things of that nature what what

482
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing so that when inevitably</font>

one more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these components and systems</font>

484
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're go to buy that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can make a</font>

485
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,580
determination of power if you're going

486
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them are there any unnecessary</font>

487
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,110

488
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:25,418
services pages and an application

<font color="#E5E5E5">accounts for an application privileges</font>

490
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:29,740
for an application again this is

491
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">something where the big vendors have</font>

492
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,429
gotten a lot better anybody remember

493
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,250
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good old days with the windows</font>

494

NT are you like installed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows NT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

495
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,159
like internet printing turned on by

496
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,658
default because why not right don't need

497
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,480
a good various worms and things like

498
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:47,889
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that was their philosophy</font>

499
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,230
you looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we're trying to get</font>

00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:51,939
additional systems administrators fuel

504
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:03,070
turn everything on all the time with the

505
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,690
expectation or the statement or the care

506
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,220
but we statement if we should go ahead

507
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">and turn off the stuff that you don't</font>

508
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">want I would contrast that with the</font>

approach that people would be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fee</font>

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">boats head which was we're going to turn</font>

511
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,570
nothin on you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explicitly enable</font>

512
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:21,399
anything that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this</font>

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:24,730
system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see over</font>

514
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:28,029
time the big vendors have shifted from a

515
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:30,669
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything on it good luck two more</font>

516
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:32,799
of a we want to be secure in our default

517
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,230
configuration and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to</font>

518
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,299
reduce the security system we want them

519
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,250
to make explicit explicit decisions to

520
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,500
do that not everybody is doing mr.

521
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,260
that's certainly the direction that we

522
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,279
have gone is this an industry I don't

523
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,399
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're there yet but I think that's</font>

524
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">great progress because the end you if</font>

525
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:51,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to turn on in an</font>

526
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:52,959
imprinting on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows Server that's</font>

527
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,699
probably a decision that you should

528
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">adapt innate and you should probably</font>

529
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to stand up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front of your peers</font>

530
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,720
and tell them they are making that

531
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,210
decision so you can suffer the

532
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,340
appropriate division and potentially

533
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,990
change your behavior you keep all

534
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,679
accounts their passwords still unable to

535
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not change</font>

536
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,540
the denial of service attack just a last

537
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,870
week with the IOT devices with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

538
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,250
default passwords so that's a that's an

539
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,840
important question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we do</font>

540
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,520
provision the servers are you setting

541
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,520
accounts and things and that's something

542
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,530
that's a challenging problem if you are

543
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,210
employing me an image of docker images

544
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,649
and things like that there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

545
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,680
value of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock down</font>

546
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,170
configurations going in and have that be

547
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,930
done repeatedly flip side of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how</font>

548
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:38,350
you manage access to those so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

549
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:40,360
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a kind of a monoculture where</font>

550
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,270
everything has the exact name effort

551
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,399
we've talked a little bit about this you

552
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:48,070
know but from a configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint</font>

553
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,560
as well as from a logic standpoint when

554
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,149
your application encounters<font color="#E5E5E5"> errors how</font>

555
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,899
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you're not leaking</font>

556
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,670
too much information out to the users of

557
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,130
the system if some of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> via</font>

558
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,930
configuration if there's an error don't

559
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,550
show the page of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack trace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

560
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,680
that other stuff but there are also

561
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:08,770
decisions that you make is developers

562
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,460
that also can impact this so what do you

563
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:14,230
report on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fill volume you say hey</font>

564
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,510
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good user name password is</font>

565
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,090
wrong or you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can find a username</font>

566
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">or do you say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> username and password</font>

567
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,270
combination is incorrect<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright in</font>

568
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,399
those first two cases you're leaking

569
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,590
information because of the way you're

570
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,480
communicating the failure you're leaking

571
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,909
information to an attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says</font>

their answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> was well you know like</font>

00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,290
sometimes we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send ex-mla on</font>

606
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,040
the way you have configured these

607
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,010
frameworks in the detectors they have in

608
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,420
place is your application<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up such</font>

609
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,750
that they can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of those</font>

610
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,110
and but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is that</font>

611
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:01,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">its work and its work than a lot of</font>

612
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:04,159
cases spans you know people's knowledge

613
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,929
areas or spans rules because what you're

614
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,030
asking across the board with this

615
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,700
configuration is staying at the highest

616
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,070
level of the application level hey when

617
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,110
you communicate about errors are you

618
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,490
revealing too much right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

619
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,500
stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> automate the answer to</font>

620
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or have like a lockdown tool that</font>

621
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,590
says that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking a question of</font>

622
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,050
what are you communicating information

623
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,580
that may be valuable to a user talking

624
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:28,040
about the business state the system

625
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,110
you're in all the way looking at the

626
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:33,080
configuration of application servers the

627
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,729
configuration of operating systems of

628
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,780
configuration database servers all of

629
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,180
these things so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be a</font>

630
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,850
challenging thing for organizations to

631
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,410
get right because it crosses so many

632
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,199
live it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

633
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:48,410
configuration like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the secure</font>

634
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,580
configuration expert and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font>

635
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,170
spend an hour security configuration

636
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,610
expert in there so every sort all this

637
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,710
whole thing that's important to

638
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:58,959
understand is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these concerns</font>

639
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,700
typically cut across roles within or

640
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,429
is a to get it right you going to do

641
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,710
this bolt or via so let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

642
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:08,380
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> snare here when you install</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

643
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,929
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> server is the administrative</font>

644
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,419
console automatically installed right on

645
00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">a developer's workstation that's</font>

646
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:18,399
probably cool because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of our</font>

647
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:19,870
developers do they have you can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

648
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,049
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workspaces they</font>

649
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,250
install stuff you things and whatnot

650
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:26,770
similarly if they're installing local

651
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,510
version of the application server they

652
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,010
probably need that administrative access

653
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,919
to go turn things on earth dissolved

654
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:35,230
whatever yeah but when you go to install

655
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> production</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> systems that's not</font>

656
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,659
appropriate that you've got your<font color="#E5E5E5"> jboss</font>

657
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:42,760
admin console exposed out for for

658
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:44,860
everybody to accident you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply</font>

659
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,289
your default account<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you</font>

660
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,580
put things<font color="#E5E5E5"> into production or do you</font>

661
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:52,149
have default credentials that are

662
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,710
exposed out there not change these a lot

663
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">of application servers these</font>

664
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,029
administrative consoles have signatures

665
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,130
that are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out right</font>

666
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,750
you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> well known urls that</font>

667
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,549
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and test to say oh yeah well this</font>

668
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a JBoss server running this version</font>

670

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,059
and password<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's something you</font>

672
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,480
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay attention to is as you</font>

deploy your systems the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

674

that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need and when you're deploying</font>

678
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,459
this up do you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

679
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:32,918
procedure or control in place that

scenario you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your web</font>

683
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,960
server you're deploying code out your

684
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:45,669
web server and you've got the web server

685
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,880
configured such that it allows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

686
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,950
directory listing so if you if you go to

695
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,010
a lot of situations as well and it's

696
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,809
something that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty easy for an</font>

697
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,539
attacker to go and look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">10 minute backers an oddity and so from</font>

00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">a configuration standpoint when you</font>

700
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,480
deploy new web servers how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

701
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,529
that you've got the right web server

configuration set up to not expose these

703

vulnerable behaviors another great

704
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:41,350
example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your stack traces if you're a</font>

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,320
verbose information about yours if

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system it's great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see like oh the</font>

710
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,690
eye of the problem is I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> check for</font>

714
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,840
absolutely the type of stuff you do not

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,460

719
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases you'll get error messages that may</font>

720
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,330
have stupids of sequel queries and

721
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:14,830
things of that nature and so when you

722
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,539
deploy production servers you want to

723
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:20,260
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are configured in</font>

724
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:22,600
such a way that if you have an error you

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:25,330
display a generic error page not woman

00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,600
there's probably plenty of

740
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,610
Floyd either right there's no reason for

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,600
those to exist on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a production system</font>

742
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:06,418
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to come there because</font>

743
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,668
if there are vulnerabilities in those

744
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:10,140
example applications and the answer

745
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:11,610
example applications I'm sure they've

746
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,830
been subject to a lot support by

747
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,080
scanning and taping and things of that

748
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,418
nature price the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java pet store whatever</font>

749
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,428
whatever stuff might be included with

750
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,169
your app server you know if you sample

751
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:24,030
applications have security flaws that

752
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:25,740
attackers who potentially use those to

753
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,020
compromise the server as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

754
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">do you can do a great job ray secure</font>

755
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,000
code but if you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

756
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:37,129
apps with security problems hang off of

757
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,780
your hanging off your deployments again

758
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,220
that's so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack need to</font>

759
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,289
accomplish whatever they<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to attack</font>

760
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,809
and so you want to make sure when you

761
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:47,908
have production<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems deployed you</font>

762
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,289
have only the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

763
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:50,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">deployed in those systems you don't</font>

764
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:53,309
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want administrative console</font>

765
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:55,049
and default application you want the

766
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:56,730
latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of your application and</font>

767
00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,470
only the latest<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of your</font>

768
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:03,419
application running on that application

769
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:06,090
server so how do you prevent security

770
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:08,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration and the big</font>

771
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,220
recommendation here is that you need to

772
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,650
establish a hardening process that makes

773
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,250
it easy to deploy another environment is

774
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:18,900
proper lockdown and 22 degree possible

775
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,150
you want your development QA a

776
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,880
production environments you're

777
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:25,470
configuring idea identically so that

778
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,260
testing on bone is representative of

779
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">test</font>

780
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,210
another you know that said there are

781
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:34,729
situations where you need did you may

782
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,740

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,729
trouble at a sudden pay attention to is

1005
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:15,559
handling things like muscle cell

1006
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:17,629
certificates I don't know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1007
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,639
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are lying from each</font>

1008
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,799
each developer gets like an actual ssl

1009
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:23,389
cert for their workstation and so we see

1010
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:27,019
them a lot like mobile applications

1011
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:29,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">where in development they'll have the</font>

1012
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:32,629
baby<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to self-signed certificates</font>

1013
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:35,599
and so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration will be</font>

1014
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:37,560
except the our ssl handshake is not

1015
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,050
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your shield potentially</font>

1016
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna work properly a bit of</font>

1017
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,690
production USA yes I actually want this

1018
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,060
only to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to HBS I pencom right</font>

1019
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,130
and so that's the situation where you

1020
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,500
need to be able to certainly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

1021
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:55,680
about automation have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process to know</font>

1022
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,170
these are the differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we had to</font>

1023
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">have between development and production</font>

1024
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure when our</font>

1025
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,980
production build our mobile app goes out

1026
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has this compiled these flags is</font>

1027
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,240
compiled XYZ you know that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font>

1028
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,480
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know and TLS certificate</font>

1029
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,520
something of that nature so that's kind

1030
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,020
of be like ideally you would want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1031
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,350
as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible so that you could go in</font>

1032
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:22,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your most invasive testing like a</font>

1033
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:24,360
QA environment and you assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hey the</font>

1034
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:27,060
ribosome that this is roughly equivalent

1035
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,040
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> production environment the</font>

1036
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,990
reality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is for like certain things</font>

1037
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,390
there are you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run into</font>

1038
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:35,189
situations where you have those

1039
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,350
differences and that's why it's

1040
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,940
important again to degree we have a

1041
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,220
document and process preferably an

1042
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,510
automated process where you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

1043
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,600
new production build is going to flip

1044
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:48,420
all the flags it's a TLS handshake has

1045
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:55,880
to work and XYZ whatever still gonna be

1046
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:55,880
pushing any other question fantastic

1047
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:24,610
he remove it long you guys still dunno

1048
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:27,970
kept very quiet all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's</font>

1049
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:31,450
move on number six of our top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1050
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:34,060
sensitive data is oh sure what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1051
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:35,379
well many web applications don't

1052
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,110
prominently protect sensitive data

1053
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:42,190
things like credit cards tax identifier

1054
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,130
account information the count<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs health</font>

1055
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,800
information authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials</font>

1056
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,750
and if they don't properly protect that

1057
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,200
then the attackers can steal a lot I

1058
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:55,060
those the weekly protected data and

1059
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,279
using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data they can do things like</font>

1060
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit card fraud identity theft and</font>

1061
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,820
other crimes and as a result of this our

1062
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,980
sense of data deserves extra protection

1063
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,680
right and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we start</font>

1064
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,320
talking about things like encryption the

1065
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,240
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen both at rest meaning</font>

1066
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,330
when the data is sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> datastore</font>

1067
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pile pile system whether</font>

1068
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:22,660
it's a entry in a database as well as in

1069
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,730
prison so as we're clicking submit the

1070
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,460
data is flying over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire our client</font>

1071
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:29,350
to our server<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh things like that and we</font>

1072
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,570
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take special precautions over</font>

1073
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:34,360
exchanging data between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browse</font>

1074
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:37,930
server now even half tier is going to be

1075
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:40,240
severe because failure in this case is

1076
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:43,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise all the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1077
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,770
intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect so once we lose the</font>

1078
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,080
data once it's out the door it's game

1079
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:49,330
over if you start looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh like the</font>

1080
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain the</font>

1081
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,520
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is data exfiltration right</font>

1082
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,020
once the day is gone is people so

1083
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,300
typically this information food

1084
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,880
sensitive data like health records like

1086
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,060
sinks of that I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

1087
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:08,160
in this step or not but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1088
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,119
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you guys</font>

1089
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,920
as a security company as do any secure

1090
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,720
development to make sure that you are

1091
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,410
properly classified the data that you

1092
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,750
guys have so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at what data</font>

1093
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in your applications you can very</font>

1094
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:25,980
quickly look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say oh this</font>

1095
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,569
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> call subscriber data that</font>

1098
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,530
we say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen and oh by the way</font>

1099
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,319
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's high desisting tag it</font>

1100
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:39,299
means them for knocking put that<font color="#CCCCCC"> day on</font>

1101
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,130
SAS provider or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1102
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:43,170
having those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pastas those kind</font>

1103
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of policies in place are really good</font>

1104
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,430
good way when we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1105
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,609
data that your applications are bossy to

1106
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:53,640
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to determine what they adopt is</font>

1107
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:56,910
obviously the value of that data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1108
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,529
impact our<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or lose it are</font>

1109
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,640
going to be the biggest factors in terms

1110
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:05,730
of determining the actual impact here

1111
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:08,549
that said there's also legal liability

1112
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:11,130
if the data is exposed so in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1113
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:14,130
health records we have HIPAA that

1114
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:16,619
basically says you can't share health

1115
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:19,500
information unless it's authorized by

1116
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:21,420
the user this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the reason why when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1117
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,490
go a doctor's<font color="#CCCCCC"> office and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doctor</font>

1118
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,410
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you everything about you but they</font>

1119
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,200
can't share you even the information

1120
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:30,828
about your spouse your<font color="#CCCCCC"> computers until</font>

1121
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually sign that HIPAA release</font>

1122
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:38,490
for that my daughter had does some

1123
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:40,500
tonsil surgery about yours so ago and

1124
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,808
the doctor actually new practices he

1125
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,839
start his<font color="#CCCCCC"> little practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he had to</font>

1126
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:47,520
send us a release so that you could give

1127
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,680
the records from his old practice

1128
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">transfer to his new practice that's how</font>

1129
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,460
strip the

1130
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:56,850
pharma and then we talked earlier about

1131
00:48:53,460 --> 00:49:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">California's 236 where you it doesn't</font>

1132
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:02,700
air where the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you lose data</font>

1134
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,960
instead of California you are legally

1135
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,030
required to report that information to

1136
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,780
the citizen and say hey we screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1137
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:14,520
you lost your faith and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then peace guy</font>

1138
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:17,760
has to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> credit cards in this</font>

1139
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,700
case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a breach of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit</font>

1140
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,350
card data pci basically says that they

1141
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,470
can take away their ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

1142
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:26,790
credit cards they can find you a pretty

1143
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,100
significant amount of money if you're

1144
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:31,620
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI compliant so these are things</font>

1145
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:35,640
where we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

1146
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:39,210
different ramifications of not properly

1147
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:41,220
protecting the data so am I vulnerable

1148
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,390
to a sense of data exposure well the

1149
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">first thing we have to do here is</font>

1150
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:46,890
determine if the data is sensitive

1151
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,230
enough to require that protection and so

1152
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where I come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that data</font>

1153
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,920

00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,390
data that we're going to be keeping in

1155
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,260
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> application we look at the</font>

1156
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,720
classification where it sits in our

1157
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,210
environment and it would look at what we

1158
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,919
need to do to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I was on</font>

1185
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:09,580
of data is really going to change the

1186
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:11,650
conversation about having an email after

1187
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,259
that point you to figuring out what

1188
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,240
security and hats off so we have things

1189

<font color="#E5E5E5">like passwords very hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workers health</font>

1191
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,910
figure out if we're if we're vulnerable

1192
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,620
the first question we ask is because any

of this data stored in clear text<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

1196
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,500
stored for example in database but that

1197
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a point of exposure</font>

1198
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were so many good access that</font>

database sequel injection clogging you

that somebody actually used that

1211

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a tape boxing when gone you</font>

know maybe so late when code and overall

1214
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,380
all those tapes use it but there's notes

1215
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:22,870
people do silly things the next question

1216
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:25,330
or ask ourselves is any of this data

1217
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:28,240
transmitting clear tax and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be</font>

your tax then that data is being exposed

1221
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,550
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a really good way</font>

1225
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:51,160

right that's literally going across the

country if not across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world in order</font>

1231
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,800
to get there and you know every single

1235
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,880
you are hitting a website and see how

1236
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">many routers that that that packet is</font>

1237
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,040
gonna promise right we can't trust

1238
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:22,959
everybody there so we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use things</font>

1239
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,570
like transport layer security like our

1240
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTTPS to ensure that that data is safe</font>

1241
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:32,470
and secure and we still have to do this

1242
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:34,810
internally i got my soapbox earlier

1243
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:37,270
talking about house just as important to

1244
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:40,690
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> https on that you know stupid for</font>

1245
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:43,300
layer using to do whatever internally

1246
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,550
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know these credentials</font>

1247
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,860
the username or password that we have

1248
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:51,070
for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization this is sensitive</font>

1249
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:52,840
information and if anybody you know have

1250
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:55,140
an attacker on my network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always</font>

1251
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:58,420
assumed another attack ground my temper

1252
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,480
if they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture my</font>

1253
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:03,610
information my username and password

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,820
regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the method scheme over</font>

1255
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:08,500
right they now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to a</font>

1256
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,480
privileged account of multiple systems

1257
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,700
and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that to take the data</font>

1258
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">and pestle training so we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1259
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,580
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using strong transport</font>

1260
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:20,440
layer security we also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1261
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,560
encryption algorithms cryptographic

1262
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:27,210
algorithms because there's a number of

1263
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:31,130
algorithms now have been obsoleted

1264
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:33,920
meaning that has computing resources

1265
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Valens it becomes easier and easier for</font>

1266
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,120
attacker to basically have the number of

1267
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,870
resources available that they can break

1268
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:44,900
those things so good example is me my

1269
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:46,819
passion every hot ashes at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1270
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we're considered to be a</font>

1271
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,650
cryptographically secure a hash is

1272
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,629
basically when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take one value</font>

1273
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,700
whether through a functioning you get

1274
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,140
back a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> value any time you run</font>

1275
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,569
your function you're always going to get

1276
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:02,839
that value back right but there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1277
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:04,600
to kind of reverse so one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm and</font>

1278
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,670
we pile which is a way of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1279
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:09,650
what's considered to be a triple

1280
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:13,250
graphically secure way to do that well

1281
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:15,650
now human resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> are such that that's</font>

1282
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:17,030
not really the case in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1284
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:22,220
go on online where you can just plug in

1285
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,470
it's like a search you can be plugin

1286
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,359
ashing to the database and it goes it's

1287
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:28,220
like there's your answer right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1288
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,660
it always keeps one way it's all you

1289
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,180
have to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep the dictionary</font>

1290
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,589
in calculate the hash for all these

1291
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,660
different coming just meet up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font>

1292
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,880
the rain move it basically look up all

1293
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,580
the sins so we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1294
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,790
all these old week / graphic algorithms

1295
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:47,600
they're not in our code I saw a really

1296
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:49,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting graphic the other day I wish</font>

1297
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,850
I put the deficit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty awesome</font>

1298
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:54,620
those basically starts with TLS middle

1299
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:57,380
and it was like he cures all the

1300
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:59,420
difference transport layer of mechanisms

1301
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,790
that you can use it was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yo Jerry</font>

1302
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomorrow say here's 80s all these</font>

1303
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,500
different things and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1304
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:09,560
has spun off its like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 85 passion do a</font>

1305
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">shot 256 in childhood basically kind of</font>

1306
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,490
spiraled out and then they even use some

1307
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,500
cool color coding where it was like

1308
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:17,330
reading for all the illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> actives</font>

1309
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,250
you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that's a good way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

1310
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:22,250
of visualize what the space looks like

1311
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,120
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way see okay well if I need</font>

1312
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,670
this and I use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> green</font>

1313
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:31,020
you just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the paths I thought</font>

1314
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was pretty cool crypto keys so we</font>

1315
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure their keys are strong</font>

that were using property management

1317
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:40,170
being that our keys are being stored in

1318
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:42,000
a secure location that we're using you

1319
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that they're being encrypted it's</font>

1320
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,610
like that that our keys are being

1321
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:49,590
rotated on regular basis again talked

1322
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the country the session</font>

1323
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:54,000
from forcing earlier just as easily you

1324
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,230
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> group horse a square</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the keys so</font>

1325
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">we wanna make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those are being</font>

rotated on<font color="#CCCCCC"> river basis and then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

1327
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,060
one here is browser security directives

1328
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,470
or headaches so there's lots of

1329
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">different headers that you can who</font>

1330
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:11,580
hasn't helped her<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your application to</font>

1331
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:18,140
make it more secure one problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

1332
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:20,520
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of earlier so just lost it</font>

1333
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,259
Jeremiah Grossman are spanked talked

1334
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,050
about it in for a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold clip</font>

1335
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:27,410
Jackie I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> look jacking was this kind</font>

1336
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:30,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">of thing where you basically put like a</font>

1337
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:33,990
think of it as like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> I crave my top of</font>

1338
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:36,210
the age that you're trying to discern if

1339
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,129
I clean this microwave layer on top of

1340
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,690
the page they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically able to</font>

1341
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,820
capture the clicks like they're making

1342
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,310
and so while they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

1343
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,290
have like anal web page that tells you

1344
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:47,310
you know make sure do this whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1345
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:49,290
on the background you're actually

1346
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:51,540
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out something else so for</font>

1347
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">example it might be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a deactivate</font>

1348
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,170
account functionality or might be a

1349
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,399
password change functionality and so

1350
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,320
what do you think you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing at a</font>

1351
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,829
clicky clicky game<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the bowls</font>

1352
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,390
or whatever in the background

1353
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,759
at least you're clicking the right

1354
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,170
buttons<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make this other application</font>

1355
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:08,390
that you don't you can see this is a

1356
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:10,579
transparent layer two things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1357
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:15,920
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do well there's actually a</font>

1358
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:18,289
browser a browser I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

1359
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,650
directive that you tu the web browser

1360
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:24,079
says don't vibrate my patient right it's

1361
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,509
an anti clicking cook jacking header

1362
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,089
that specifically says when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you move my</font>

1363
00:58:26,509 --> 00:58:30,499
page to not be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a knacker now that</font>

1364
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:33,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">might break something if you're trying</font>

1365
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:35,058
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> some weird proxy portal you</font>

1366
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:36,738
want that page to show up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that portal</font>

1367
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:38,900
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it's</font>

1368
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:40,160
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pray but it's also</font>

1369
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,709
good prevents in life been doing

1370
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,118
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that good jack so these</font>

1371
00:58:42,709 --> 00:58:46,249
are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to kind of be</font>

1372
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:50,599
conscious of it and actually take action

1373
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:53,479
on based on our situation so here's an

1374
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,519
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario we have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font>

1375
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:57,499
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups credit card numbers in</font>

1376
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,078
database using on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac database</font>

1377
00:58:57,499 --> 00:59:03,229
encryption but this also means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1378
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,630
decrypt the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> when's retreat so think</font>

1379
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:07,729
in terms of like the guys who I was

1380
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:10,849
talking to last night they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were like</font>

1381
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:12,468
yeah we use Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> Azure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and bike</font>

1382
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:15,349
shop if you're automatically does the

1383
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:17,359
incur fee and deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly</font>

1384
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:18,979
does the encryption decryption that

1385
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,869
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that every time their application</font>

1386
00:59:18,979 --> 00:59:22,609
basically calls into the database is

1387
00:59:20,869 --> 00:59:25,670
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the incorrect or the deep</font>

1388
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:27,619
roots well<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequel injection is just</font>

1389
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:30,559
another way of calling into the database

1390
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:33,529
right so if there are encryption layers

1391
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,589
based on that then my sequel injection

1392
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:38,660
is going past that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in the</font>

1393
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:40,788
case of encrypting the day of the

1394
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,729
database I probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an</font>

1395
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:45,949
application level encryption and then

1396
00:59:43,729 --> 00:59:48,499
shove it through my<font color="#E5E5E5"> steep or whatever</font>

1397
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:50,060
into the day because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

1398
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:52,370
the my application is

1399
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,580
virgin decription that way a sequel

1400
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:59,390
injection was 50 cent here's another

1401
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario this was a great tool maybe</font>

1402
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:06,350
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago or so is called fireship</font>

1403
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:08,330
ir she was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is this firefox</font>

1404
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:10,069
plugin that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and if you</font>

1405
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:12,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like a starbucks or some coffee</font>

1406
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:15,170
shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire up the parachute and what i</font>

1407
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,750
would do is if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network for anybody</font>

1408
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,220
using certain applications

1409
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,920
twitterfacebook of stuff like that and

1410
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it saw that information go across</font>

1411
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,060
the network we would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture</font>

1412
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,399
the cookie<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture with prudential that</font>

1413
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,650
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using or taxes that side and it</font>

1414
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like it basically was like do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you or</font>

1415
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:35,960
logon esta season and all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1416
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:38,000
is like yes and now I was under login as

1417
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,010
I use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> surfing facebook like manner</font>

1418
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,830
and posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> where like you're done right</font>

1419
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:45,710
and so firesheep would was really good

1420
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:48,080
in terms of the fruit concept of showing

the importance of SSL encryption it

can do that broken authentication

01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,149
of the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> will escort for the hash</font>

01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:33,060
value following if all you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1464
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:34,920
writing that that password room will say

1465
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:37,259
an md5 hash which we said is not

1466
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,420
cryptograph to secure and we're scouring

1467
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,000
the information in the database then we

1468
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,440
can do what a great low tables and we

1469
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,390
can basically run through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1470
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,520
different password combinations and now

1471
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,740
all we have to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we get that that</font>

1472
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">password hash we just plug it into their</font>

1473
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">get back the information about what the</font>

1474
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,810
password is and now we can log into the

1475
01:02:53,670 --> 01:03:01,830
web web site and so this camel actually

1476
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:04,160
shows you those md5 rainbow tables it's

1477
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:07,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">a about four thousand gigabytes or so</font>

1478
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,140
across all of these different tables and

1479
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:14,930
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

size of those databases but with

1491
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:43,319
computing power today's really really

1492
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:45,450
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to just say cheers all the</font>

1493
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,430
possible inputs let's throw all those

1494
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,288
into business growth through this a

1495
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:53,069
solution and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

1496
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:57,839
data now we have that matter this is

1497
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:58,769
without something I was just yep again I

1498
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:01,680
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that well I don't</font>

1499
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:07,410
know about most people I can't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1500
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:09,419
that basically when saying is that what

1501
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:11,788
we do to prevent this as we do is call

1502
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:15,960
salting insulting is basically for every

1503
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:18,119
user entry in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their password</font>

1504
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,039
which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this hash we added</font>

1505
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:22,440
a random down and that rate of values

1506
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,240
most all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the songs and so for each user</font>

1507
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're trying to do this with we</font>

1508
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,500
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> create another entry that's</font>

1509
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:30,868
our salt and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the first time</font>

1510
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,670
this user you uses this password the

1511
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:34,170
first time they set this bathroom we

1512
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:36,450
take the password we combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1513
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">salt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hashing function</font>

1514
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:40,919
and now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our hatch that's the</font>

1515
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:42,869
value that we stored our database and

1516
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,759
because we're store data our database we

1517
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have the actual cops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word which</font>

1518
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:48,119
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our system gets compromised</font>

1519
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:51,149
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I won't do</font>

1520
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:52,710
that because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the self value it</font>

1521
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,990
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even do this</font>

1522
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:56,480
rainbow table thing we

1523
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:59,029
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically entirely random value</font>

1524
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,770
plus their password in or do you even

1525
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:03,980
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do this rainbow table think it</font>

1526
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:06,830
becomes way way more complicated to to

1527
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:10,450
do a rainbow table with that so that's

1528
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason why we use salted passive oh</font>

1529
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:22,279
yeah yeah so most of the hashing

1530
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:25,730
algorithms that you see the ones that

1531
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:28,580
haven't been obsoleted of the md5 the

1532
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,560
reason why is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the number of</font>

1533
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:35,000
rotations that they do so what you'll

1534
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:36,980
see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be curved as an example they</font>

1535
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,140
don't just do this hashing thing once

1536
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,060
right if I take it through this function

1537
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,540
I take this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put it here that's</font>

1538
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,220
really really easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to do and it</font>

1539
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer long time to do</font>

1540
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,490
that so you can whip through those

1541
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:52,580
combinations very quickly the whole idea

1542
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,950
behind these more is bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> alber that</font>

1543
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:57,830
was the shop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably would not is it</font>

1544
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:59,839
takes more time to construe de and so

1545
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:01,279
what they do to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they run</font>

1546
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,990
through that function and then they

1547
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,480
write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and they run again</font>

1548
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:07,819
sometimes in some words other times<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1549
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know going through that that process of</font>

1550
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:14,690
writing for that hashing function in

1551
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:17,150
ordering in that fight back yep exactly

1552
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:19,220
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to when it comes to the</font>

1553
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:21,260
hashing you want hashing functions that

1554
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,819
are going to be slower because it makes

1555
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,700
it much more difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to</font>

1556
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:32,180
do rainbow tangler or to traffic report

1557
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:33,618
yep all right yes the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> the salt the</font>

1558
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,160
salt is stored<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the database it's</font>

01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass the idea is that the salt is just a</font>

1561
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:41,819
random value that you're able to

1564
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:50,310
poor choices but it comes to the

1565
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:52,290
passwords and things like that right a

1566
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,970
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times those choices are based on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things like dictionary borders and stuff</font>

1568
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:57,600
like that which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to look up a</font>

short words and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1571
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:05,850
the salt is basically adding in some

1572
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:08,910
randomization and we're not entirely

1573
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:11,339
found on the user to to give us proper

1574
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:13,319
balance it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the</font>

01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:18,210
tables and automate that here this hash

1577
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,620
calculates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font>

1578
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,020
basically making it so that they can't

01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:23,430
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've added this random chunk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">onto it so they can't just go through</font>

1581
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:30,500
the dictionary here's all the stuff so

1582
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:30,500
usually get salt<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1583
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,480
right they would not have the salt and

1584
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,680
the password can they happen they

1585
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically have to go through that</font>

1586
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:41,509
exercise all over again regenerating the

1587
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,490
rainbow table with that particular salt

1588
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:52,010
and email can do that they only have one

1589
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:55,069
user it's pretty slow puncture yeah it's

1590
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:57,619
definitely possible the goal of this

1591
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:59,720
exercises<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more disclosing talent than</font>

1592
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:02,030
anything else because long as you're

1593
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,859
doing your security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front they</font>

1594
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:05,780
shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess fault but</font>

1595
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,910
you have to absolutely they're able to

1596
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,010
get away to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the salt out of the</font>

1597
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:12,529
database now they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that piece they</font>

1598
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:14,450
still have to do they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font>

1599
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:18,020
through the entire dictionary create

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 Gate rainbow table of all the</font>

different passwords plus the salt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1602
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:24,310
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

1603
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,310
answer

1604
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:49,198
yeah I all depends on the vendor that's

1605
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:50,940
doing it and the developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work</font>

1606
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,629
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole reason why we're here</font>

1607
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:58,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so Amazon may be hiring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1608
01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:00,710
you can fix that or or sharp or samsung

1609
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,710
or

1610
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:14,810
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were smart right</font>

1611
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:17,060
they put like a TPM module onto the

1612
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:19,850
board and what they use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV on we're</font>

1613
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,310
doing things like that but you can do

1614
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:24,530
hardware-based encryption but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah i'm</font>

1615
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:26,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">guessing that when you can buy this is a</font>

1616
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:28,130
huge classroom TV for four hundred

1617
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,960
dollars that they're not really worried

1618
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:33,190
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> bridge those having virtual ships</font>

1619
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,189
and things like that is good

1620
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:46,618
yes yep well I mean these devices don't

1621
01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:49,558
have a ton of computing power there it's

1622
01:09:46,618 --> 01:09:51,769
like a raspberry pi<font color="#E5E5E5"> base is nothing to</font>

1623
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:51,770
it

1624
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,450
fire

1625
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:04,550
I

1626
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:27,380
yeah interesting related note so I at

1627
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:29,089
one point I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey order I can get</font>

1628
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:32,659
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> suit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> horse application for my</font>

1629
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:34,790
raspberry pi the answer is yes FK the

1630
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:37,699
challenge that I ran into was actually

1631
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:39,679
with the hashing function the raspberry

1632
01:10:37,699 --> 01:10:41,540
pi didn't have enough power and<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

1633
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,610
have enough memory to really approach

1634
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,580
during the hashing this book is possible

1635
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:48,619
so long in to savour it was something

1636
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:50,210
that probably took it because it had to

1637
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,830
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> through all that function</font>

1638
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:53,150
once you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there pending works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1639
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,099
fine because now you're just using that

1640
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:56,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">session credential but getting asked</font>

1641
01:10:55,099 --> 01:10:58,699
that initial watery<font color="#E5E5E5"> screams in forever</font>

1642
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:02,810
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bicycles of</font>

1643
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:07,848
college enough to do all that yeah other

1644
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:10,270
questions however<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep going the last</font>

1645
01:11:07,849 --> 01:11:13,159
scenario here is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just showing</font>

1646
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:15,880
another pictorial in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of</font>

1647
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:18,110
the balance right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

1648
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,179
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> where some bass in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pinch</font>

1649
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:21,949
application they're sensitive different

1650
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:24,170
patients being stored into the database

1651
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:25,848
and then that information gets both out

1652
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:28,219
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database including to some sort</font>

1653
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:30,530
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ibaka</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if those backups are decrypted</font>

1654
01:11:28,219 --> 01:11:33,110
and they fall off the truck or they get

1655
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:34,489
stolen or whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be now</font>

1656
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:36,710
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario where some a has</font>

1657
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:38,780
access to that data so this really

1658
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:41,119
importance to why it's really important

1659
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,340
if you're doing that dose of sensitive

1660
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:46,610
data that those backups on purpose as

1661
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:49,070
well the good news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

1662
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:51,380
modern backup utilities and we're using

1663
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:54,019
have the ability to use ease to do

1664
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:54,820
encourage enter that data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it</font>

1665
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:58,180
becomes a

1666
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:03,460
exercise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and how control back</font>

1667
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:04,990
you rotate that uses all right so how

1668
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:07,780
about the vent sense of day exposure

1669
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:09,340
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> crawl sense data you want</font>

1670
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to consider those for us that we plan to</font>

1671
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,930
protect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> damper right so we have to</font>

1672
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:16,060
know what what is the the cat was the

1673
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario under which we need to be</font>

1674
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:21,730
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you contemplate part is</font>

1675
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:23,920
this a the inside uses somebody who has

1676
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:26,469
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vast access that</font>

1678
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:30,130
because its own hear that and then based

1679
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:32,380
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make sure that we improve</font>

1680
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:34,240
all the sense of day of rest and transit

1681
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:36,280
in America the feds against those

1682
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:37,690
attacks so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will all make sure that</font>

1683
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,179
we're addressing those specific

1684
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:42,040
steering's the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

1685
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:45,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source sense of data unnecessarily</font>

1686
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:48,040
right this goes for things like credit

1687
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:50,650
cards it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great example if all I do</font>

1688
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,360
every time somebody places in order on

1689
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:54,849
my site is take that current artists for

1690
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">real daya's take the course or database</font>

1691
01:12:54,850 --> 01:13:00,940
eventually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Davis is really really</font>

1692
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:02,920
big right if somebody were to compromise

1693
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,290
that system so we were able not a sequel

1694
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,660
injection bar whatever and get get

1695
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:09,370
access to that data now they've got huge

1696
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,200
history of all the credit cards that

1697
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">were used on that site and some of these</font>

1698
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:17,230
credit cards are valid for unity real

1699
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:19,870
all series from so the the moral of this

1700
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:22,269
story is if it stated that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

1701
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:24,820
right if it is one time to charge the

1702
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:27,070
car and then we're good sku read that

1703
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,870
data right maybe maybe we have a policy

1704
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:30,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">where sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to charge back</font>

1705
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:33,269
at cards we have to sort that reason

1706
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:34,438
okay oh I get it so let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

1707
01:13:33,269 --> 01:13:36,360
two months let's keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> car</font>

1708
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:38,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">information every month and then we</font>

1709
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,499
delete the data the idea here of you

1710
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:42,539
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of policy sort of</font>

1711

a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place that when we no</font>

that is that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid the third ampere</font>

those forums do this ugly thing which

01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:08,500
basically means that are saving that it

1745
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,480
the browser and there are exploits that

1746
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,730
can allow an attacker to pull that data

of the browser just through cross-site

1753
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,030
scripting so it becomes very very easy

01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,940
for an attacker to love to leverage

1755
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:33,820
these from taps and young they have said

are seemingly pretty small from the

throw rocks at like baths thereby making

1781
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:55,900
I actually have the example data

1783

already have one it's a great place to

1784
01:16:57,489 --> 01:17:03,159
start this gives us kind of the basis

1785
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,230
for a whole policy here and then when we

1786
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:07,360
start talking with developed or sort of

1787

easily point2<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is the day this</font>

about storing this is the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

conserve it here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy that says</font>

1793
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,440
that we have to encrypt your that we

can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trip there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do whatever here's</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece that says where we can store</font>

1796
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:28,059
this data right it's no longer just a

1797
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversational way I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should do</font>

1798
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,170
this whenever it's yours impulsive this

1799
01:17:30,010 --> 01:17:34,030
is what we feel I should be in place if

1800
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:36,210
you like except you can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1801
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:38,769
but this is the standard company balls

1802
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:40,900
we want to review the information store

01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:54,099
very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just says we create three</font>

conscious decision about what data is is

1835
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:56,679
not gave me high impact and whether it

1836
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:58,690
should or should not be pretty in terms

1837
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:01,560
of implementation level safeguards who

are you strong encryption algorithms

1839
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:08,920
fifth says that Triple DES is still ok

1840
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:11,170
however AES is the preferred mechanism

by encrypting sensitive data at rest and

transit we don't want sources of data

1879

necessarily get rid of it and don't eat

ok

1883
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,000
what's up

1884
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:48,669
pagers there was a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

1885
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:51,369
presentation of black hat was the year

1886
01:21:48,669 --> 01:21:55,139
before last and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what these guys did is</font>

1887
01:21:51,369 --> 01:21:58,449
they used a standard kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a TV</font>

1888
01:21:55,139 --> 01:22:01,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">card yeah and they basically start doing</font>

1889
01:21:58,449 --> 01:22:05,018
spectrum analyzation of it was like

1890
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:06,909
restaurant patrons have a really cool

1891
01:22:05,019 --> 01:22:08,619
presentation they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at it</font>

1892
01:22:06,909 --> 01:22:10,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rainbow figure out based on this</font>

1893
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:12,879
wave pattern or whatever here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bits</font>

1894
01:22:10,989 --> 01:22:15,009
they're actually being broadcasted and

1895
01:22:12,879 --> 01:22:17,919
they reversed engineered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

1896
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:20,260
this bit identifies this particular

1897
01:22:17,919 --> 01:22:22,570
device and therefore if I flip this I

1898
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:24,519
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> access this device and if I do this</font>

1899
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:26,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and actually all the devices to off at</font>

1900
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:28,479
once so these guys basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> sat outside</font>

1901
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:30,308
the restaurant they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1902
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,169
let's make that we go and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1903
01:22:30,309 --> 01:22:34,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are exposing your new person fix</font>

1904
01:22:32,169 --> 01:22:35,949
it up like okay let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that one that</font>

1905
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,510
one starts going off in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leg strength</font>

1906
01:22:35,949 --> 01:22:39,608
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them all go off that's what I</font>

1907
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:41,859
was going crazy bald of the things are

1908
01:22:39,609 --> 01:22:44,550
going off this is great soft really

1909
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting stuff</font>

1910
01:22:51,240 --> 01:23:02,460
yeah yeah

1911
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:12,160
yet the self side thing is another for

1912
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:13,720
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> soap box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out it again the salt sign</font>

1913
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,550
is another really interesting thing

1914
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:17,380
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time the cordless all</font>

1915
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">signing certificates out there they have</font>

1916
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned it you know there's a lot of</font>

1917
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,700
Deb environments where we use

1918
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:23,469
self-signed certificates we're

1919
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:25,870
effectively training those users to

1920
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:28,030
click OK what's meant to be a security

1921
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:29,740
work the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self</font>

1922
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">signed certificate is to say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1923
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:33,790
certificate is either inspired or it's a

1924
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,980
different domain than what we're trying

1925
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to access here and we get that such as</font>

1926
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:40,000
good morning begins to danger will

1927
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:43,389
robinson there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right</font>

1928
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,640
and the user should really think about I

1929
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:47,110
think okay why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient probable</font>

1930
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,690
that thing's expired oh they<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1931
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:52,210
got rotate it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean those</font>

1932
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:54,219
match hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a big problem but ain't</font>

1933
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,870
who you see that that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1934
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:57,940
attacker two of them right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the</font>

1935
01:23:55,870 --> 01:24:00,130
middle they go change the ssl

1936
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:02,589
certificate and because the person is

1937
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,880
trained to just put yes both yes the

1938
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:05,860
attacker can be looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1939
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,810
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've seen all that date</font>

1940
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:11,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it so any time you give one of those</font>

1941
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:13,930
ssl certificate worries i urge you not

1942
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:15,850
to just click yes but the take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

1943
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">pause right it doesn't have to be click</font>

1944
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:20,560
away and think about why that message

1945
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:22,780
popped up and think about is this

1946
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:25,120
typical should i click this is this an

1947
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:27,040
outpatient<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trust if I going over the</font>

1948
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet or is this just your my home</font>

1949
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:32,340
server over the kids maybe because that

1950
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:36,480
could be indicative of a much bigger

1951
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:39,730
step off my soap box<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other motions</font>

1952
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,589
poop<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let Dan</font>

1953
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:45,820
talk you guys about missing function

1954
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:51,310
global access control oh yeah great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1955
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:54,389
oh so it is 217 I will take 10 minute

1956
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,390
breaks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's own</font>
