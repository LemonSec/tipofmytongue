1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,050
hello everybody hey there we are this is

2
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,380
the fireside<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat as you can see we've</font>

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the Yule Log going it's the closest</font>

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing I think we could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get without</font>

5
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:34,680
getting some fire marshals involved

6
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,120
anyway my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> robert arsenic Hanson</font>

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm the vice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president labs of white hat</font>

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,970
security and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask me what</font>

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically I build all the stuff</font>

10
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,360
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a home anywhere</font>

11
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,920
else or no one can figure out how to

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
build or whatever so I go off and build

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,850
it some examples are like aviator and

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,050
some internal stuff that you'll probably

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,120
never see you've never ate the light of

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,280
day and so on but<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the black cat</font>

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
advisory board<font color="#CCCCCC"> every strong hackers or I</font>

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,329
guess I still technically do wrote some

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,440
books and I break the web all the time

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,200
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um let's just get into it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how about</font>

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so I want to talk a little bit</font>

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,659
about how bad guys find websites and I

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,240
think it's it's possibly evolving very

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,520
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rapidly so let's talk about how</font>

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,929
they used to find websites so once<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon</font>

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,940
a time let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to scan the</font>

27
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,250
entire internet looking for vulnerable

28
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,310
websites of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular vulnerability</font>

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,290
that I knew about<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something it could</font>

30
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,060
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know anywhere from months to</font>

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,729
even a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more when I first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,860
off on the internet because processing

33
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,130
time was not particularly good bandwidth

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,259
was bad you know the ecosystem<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind</font>

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,810
of really spread out we didn't really

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,700
understand the whole RFC thing and you

37
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,320
know scanning things like 10 dot was not

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,329
particularly effective and all kinds of

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff but anyway it took you know</font>

40
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,158
sometimes what we would call like an

41
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,479
endless amount of scanning<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,860
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the time we were done</font>

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,689
scanning you kind of had to start the

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,439
whole process over again and rescan the

45
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,449
internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet has</font>

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed significantly and let's say in</font>

47
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,850
the last year or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so now due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,549
a change in the linux kernel last year

49
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,649
you can now scan the entire internet on

50
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,530
a single port with about four machines

51
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 megabits each you can do it in about</font>

52
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:21,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">four minutes four minutes so that has</font>

53
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,620
changed the what landscape landscape

54
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,769
looks like from a threat perspective

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,080
very significantly or at a minimum it's

56
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,640
about two and

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,910
the reason is just because the attackers

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,980
haven't really figured it out so TCP and

59
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:39,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">UDP on on ipv4 is effectively probed</font>

60
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,780
there you hiding something on a high

61
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,780
port or something that does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

62
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,990
anymore I mean it never really worked

63
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,880
but now it definitely doesn't work ipv6

64
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,860
is a whole different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballgame you still</font>

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,150
are technically safe in there as long as

66
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,850
I can't figure out approximately where

67
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,770
you are but that whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> operation based</font>

68
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:00,650
on you hiding on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet with ports</font>

69
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,680
does not work so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk a little</font>

70
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,690
bit about the technology so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon a</font>

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,820
time or a tool called<font color="#E5E5E5"> fears which does</font>

72
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,220
DNS enumeration also finds

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,470
non-contiguous IP space so let's say you

74
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a target you'd scan for that targets</font>

75
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,840
using fierce then you turn nmap loose on

76
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,609
the results of that and you would get a

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,070
listing of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open ports of your</font>

78
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,330
target now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff because that</font>

79
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,130
change in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux kernel I was talking</font>

80
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,680
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like zmapp and mass can and</font>

81
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,910
these don't require all that nonsense I

82
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,890
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan the whole internet I don't</font>

83
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,570
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything funky like figure</font>

84
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,399
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your IP space is I'll just</font>

85
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,660
figure out all of the IP space on the

86
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,430
entire internet it's actually just more

87
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,470
efficient to do it that way this

88
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,930
particular screenshot is actually taken

89
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,290
from a botnet that was scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,209
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet probably maybe as much</font>

91
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">as once a minute it was scanning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,640
entire internet and it was able to

93
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,290
detect changes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,679
servers going up and down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet based on Hurricane sandy coming</font>

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,220
through and kind of wiping out the city

97
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,600
so as damage assessments you know if

98
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,680
you're in a wartime situation and

99
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,630
there's bombs blowing up you can

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,790
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect that that particular</font>

101
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,320
target has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken down by virtue of</font>

102
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,030
you not being able to ping that

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,430
particular IP address or set of IP

104
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,350
addresses or whatever so they were able

105
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,840
to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turning on and off basically</font>

106
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it was happening which is pretty</font>

107
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,179
amazing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk more about that in</font>

108
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:26,539
a bit so I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds bad but it's</font>

109
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,419
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> much much worse than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I</font>

110
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,610
know no one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever said I'm a bearer of</font>

111
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:35,469
good news so why is pre computing better

112
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,050
than

113
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,030
fast Gant so fast Gansey oh I can scan

114
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,410
the entire internet like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in four</font>

115
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,270
minutes for a single IP address or

116
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,640
single court rather skinny entire

117
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,620
internet get all that data back but

118
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,000
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of slow if I</font>

119
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,680
actually scan the internet let's say

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,690
last week because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doing it all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,310
time is pretty obnoxious if I did it

122
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,350
like last week I can shove it a new

123
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,090
database and if I have in a database I

124
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,760
can do lookups effectively in real time

125
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,979
I can say find me all of the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports</font>

126
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,570
that are you know vulnerable to whatever

127
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,220
whatever i'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

128
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,080
application or something that I'm

129
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,180
exploitable or whatever show me<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results now and so I can get the</font>

131
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,100
results back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds not minutes</font>

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,750
seconds and the internet does change and

133
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,610
in a week it will change a little bit

134
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,830
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not significantly enough that you</font>

135
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,010
won't get a huge target list if as long

136
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,669
as it's a fairly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know dense</font>

137
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,530
vulnerability or whatever we're talking

138
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">about and the nice part is it's</font>

139
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,609
effectively no false positives because

140
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,830
the internet doesn't wrap it doesn't

141
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">change that quickly so we're going to</font>

142
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">start seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more of that we're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start seeing people started and</font>

144
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,700
use this stuff and I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

evidence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so there's some people</font>

147
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,919
michigan in conjunction with rapid seven

148
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,120
there's any rupted seven employees here

149
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,440
no that's too<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shoutouts to those</font>

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,630
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing really really cool</font>

151
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,790
stuff if you run into tray for tell them

152
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,490
like their stuff they're doing is very

153
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,960
very important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us by the way</font>

154
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,220
so right now they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing several</font>

155
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,020
different types of scans this is

156
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,590
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a complete list they doing</font>

157
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,060
HTTP s ecosystem scans of things like

158
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,400
HAARP lead and stuff figuring out what

159
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,990
servers are vulnerable reverse and also

160
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,870
for DNS that's actually a new thing

161
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,190
service fingerprints port 80 just

162
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,890
basically crawling the entire internet

163
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,540
so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool stuff</font>

164
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,710
barely what I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there's some</font>

165
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,090
other smoothly cool stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

166
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,960
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that there hopefully</font>

167
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be doing the not too distant</font>

168
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">future but it's it's definitely going</font>

169
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:31,300
also muaks uh guys familiar with muaks

170
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,450
you guys know him awesome good he's a

171
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,210
cool guy he's running a reverse dns scan

172
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,740
of the entire internet right now it was

173
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,080
temporarily offline i'm not sure if you

174
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,599
brought it back online

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,830
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the reason it was offline is</font>

176
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,930
because he ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of hard drive space</font>

177
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:52,139
so the other one that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

178
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is unicorn net it's basically</font>

179
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,199
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS heartbleed scanner where he's</font>

180
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,090
basically charging around<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a half a</font>

181
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,830
Bitcoin or something for any result that

182
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want of a target list so basically</font>

183
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,039
you say here's the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a set</font>

184
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,299
of IP addresses that I'm interested in

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,860
he'll tell you if he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got information</font>

186
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,330
about it no give you little snip it and

187
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,800
then you pay some amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and</font>

188
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get the entire heartbleed dump</font>

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,240
without actually doing the attack

190
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,530
yourself why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that bad well for the</font>

191
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,030
obvious reason that now I know for

192
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">neural lists and I can go attack</font>

193
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,080
individual targets I'm interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in but</font>

194
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,560
also from a forensics perspective this

195
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a total nightmare so imagine I have a</font>

196
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,150
heart bleed you know vulnerability and

197
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,270
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it right so a month later</font>

198
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:35,729
or something somebody attacks me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

199
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,620
very first attack the very first attempt

200
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:40,080
they make they<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised something</font>

201
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,789
that's really esoteric on my site like

202
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,099
how the hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they do that must have</font>

203
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,740
been an insider they must have somehow

204
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,419
like no like<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised my vendor who</font>

205
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,800
wrote the code like there's got to be

206
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,359
something else going on there but not

207
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,009
snot what happened what happened is

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,990
they've got this old heart bleep data

209
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,539
went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> called it found like old</font>

210
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,520
cookie data they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found a directory that</font>

211

was supposed to be hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> to isn't some</font>

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,400
source code that might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an SQL</font>

213
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,739
injection or command ejection in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique so that minor information leak</font>

215
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,279
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used way in the future even even</font>

216
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,389
though you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you patched the</font>

217
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,979
vulnerability if there are any

218
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,659
vulnerabilities that were disclosed

219
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,219
during that heartbleed which is a great

220
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,839
way to you know uncover all kinds of

221
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,370
stuff in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that file system they can</font>

222
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,750
effectively use that against<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and so</font>

223
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">just been a few minutes of testing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

224
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,680
think i was able to compromise about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40</font>

225
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,210
different machines just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> harper lee</font>

226
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,860
data from unicorn<font color="#E5E5E5"> without even paying</font>

227
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,448
for it which is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy um so the</font>

228
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,269
other one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the insert internet census</font>

229
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,159
project this is actually no one knows

230
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,810
who did this apparently it is by

231
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:43,409
anonymous anonymous hacked into 1.2

232
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,000
million routers and he was using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

233
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,339
scan the entire internet which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

234
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,740
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this I like this botnet because</font>

235
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,600
he used one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three passwords default</font>

236
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,100
passwords like admin

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
squirt in one two three<font color="#E5E5E5"> four five six or</font>

238
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">something and he was able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hack into</font>

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,980
1.2 million routers which said another

240
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,750
way is 1.2 million networks so you and

241
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,329
with 1.2 million networks at your

242
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,920
disposal usually on broadband it turns

243
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,630
out you can scan the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet very very</font>

244
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">rapidly so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make pretty graphs</font>

245
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,949
like this which you totally can't see

246
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,389
because it's too dark but basically that

247
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:17,579
it's a really beautiful looking graph

248
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,170
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss out on but it</font>

249
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:21,508
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just shows the landscape of</font>

250
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,399
the entire world and it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

251
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-motion he has got gifts and stuff</font>

252
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,319
they showed turning on and off as it

253
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,180
kind of traverses the entire day span

254
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,370
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn on and off in</font>

255
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,258
different countries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scan</font>

256
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,029
the entire internet literally in seconds

257
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do it basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

258
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,199
so you can find everything coming up

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,089
turning off so again you thinking you

260
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:46,709
have something on a high port that that

261
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:49,259
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but it gets worse so show</font>

262
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dan it's a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun little tool if you</font>

263
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:51,779
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> played with you definitely</font>

264
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,489
should especially if you're a nap sec

265
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,870
there's all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool research stuff</font>

266
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,720
you can do so let's say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

267
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,100
vulnerable service like HP five point

268
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,300
three point three that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

269
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,399
attack let's say let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

270
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,310
vulnerability in that remote command

271
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,949
injection as an example in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

272
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,479
particular example if I'm 1.5 million

273
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,758
targets that are potentially vulnerable

274
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,259
that I could go take over and

275
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,329
effectively I just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay and all</font>

276
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,769
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden I get this huge dump of all</font>

277
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,388
these vulnerable servers and I can go to

278
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:20,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">tack and create my own botnet which I</font>

279
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:21,449
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this at other attack stuff</font>

280
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,329
that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

281
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:25,680
to probe so the reason why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad</font>

282
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:27,959
is bad for two given reasons one it kind

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,089
of articulates the whole store and then

284
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,819
attack type mentality that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving</font>

285
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,740
towards but also it shows that that

286
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,569
minor information leak of that exported

287
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,990
for re-export for what i was saying

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">expired by rather is although it is a</font>

289
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,050
minor information leak it actually can

290
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,008
make a big difference it suddenly puts

291
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,229
you on the target list where you

292
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,209
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been in another case not</font>

293
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,470
that it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean ultimately they</font>

294
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,790
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just attack the entire internet</font>

295
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,139
and some people have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in fact</font>

296
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,209
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're kind of currently</font>

297
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,620
doing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will change very</font>

298
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,989
rapidly once people figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how much</font>

299
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,870
more efficient they can be then it's all

300
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,970
about saving money so in my opinion you

301
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,100
should have banned in the hole

302
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,170
time-based obfuscation so once upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

303
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,810
time being on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet having a</font>

304
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,819
vulnerable service it was like okay well

305
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,430
we're vulnerable to this exploit or

306
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:14,870
something we have time like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

307
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a great quote it's like the</font>

308
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,029
problem is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you have time you</font>

309
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:22,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a very little time at</font>

310
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,379
that and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happening here is</font>

311
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,729
that whole time based obfuscation like

312
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:27,230
we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix this vulnerability</font>

313
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,050
because no one's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find us on the</font>

314
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,329
internet that is not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

315
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,699
anymore or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away very</font>

316
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:35,959
quickly and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay for the</font>

317
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,370
small-time attackers who don't really

318
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,079
understand what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

319
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,870
the more sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> adversaries are</font>

320
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,769
definitely moving in this direction so

321
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you an example so we had</font>

322
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:48,379
this Ruby on Rails vulnerability he was

323
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,759
last year and basically you know someone

324
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,170
came out with it I've got putting as

325
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,899
Floyd and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it started being attacked so</font>

326
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,170
here's a brief example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a timeline of</font>

327
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,670
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers who have this issue</font>

328
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,339
over on this side is basically on the

329
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,990
your left hand side is basically when

330
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,699
this vulnerability came out and then you

331
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,370
can sort of see they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

332
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:09,410
it got put in mezz flight they patched

333
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,120
it if they put an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids rule in place to</font>

334
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,920
look for it and then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

335
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacked and that's the red boxes there</font>

336
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,120
you see so they were able to defend

337
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:21,199
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just barely I mean really</font>

338
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,509
just by a day or so so that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

339
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,920
bracket there underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is really</font>

340
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,139
what i'm talking about that is shrinking

341
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,500
very very rapidly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it took for</font>

342
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:33,110
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit and actually</font>

343
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,649
being attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that case was one day</font>

344
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow really really</font>

345
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:39,800
slow I think I mean that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

346
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,379
really fast to you i'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

347
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,559
oh god<font color="#E5E5E5"> i only have a data patch no no I</font>

348
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you have possibly seconds possibly</font>

349
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,680
seconds so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font>

350
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think like our adversaries instead of</font>

351
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,029
spent a lot of my time talking with

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,829
adversaries but we also think I have to

353
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know who could be our</font>

354
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,559
adversary maybe it's not just some

355
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:03,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">random hacker trying to steal data from</font>

356
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">it maybe it's our competitors because</font>

357
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,099
some of the bad guys I'm talking to they

358
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,839
work for companies or they are companies

359
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,370
there are attempting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take over other</font>

360
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies or do bad things to them</font>

361
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,800
because from their perspective from a

362
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:15,359
monetary

363
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,219
monitors respect what this all comes

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,440
down to money right I mean all at the

365
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,990
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day everything's about money</font>

366
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,510
what they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is to remove you</font>

367
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,430
from the index and Google if they can if

368
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,290
they can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're less likely</font>

369
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,000
to get clicked on people aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

370
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,490
know about you they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna write</font>

371
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,870
articles about you therefore you're

372
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,339
eventually going to go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they can</font>

373
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,680
hurt enough of your market share and and

374
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,709
they get that market share that they can

375
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very brief brief</font>

376
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,609
brief list I know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seem</font>

377
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,050
long but it's a brief list of some of

378
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,100
the examples of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

379
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to hear them talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and</font>

380
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,180
this this is the non technical stuff so

381
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">this should scare the out you</font>

382
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,160
because basically anyone can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

383
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,950
ways that you can totally screw over

384
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,600
your competitors some examples you build

385
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,790
a robot tell it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name it</font>

386
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
your competitors bot and basically you

387
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,880
crawl the entire internet and basically

388
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,380
what happens is you get a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

389
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,910
phone calls saying please stop scanning

390
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,189
the internet you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really annoying the</font>

391
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,300
crap out of us and waste a ton of their

392
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,940
time and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to</font>

393
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,790
actually do real business send tons of

394
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,079
spam spoofed messages of from your

395
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,939
competitors email accounts and that

396
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chris's gigantic back stressed like</font>

please stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> email me it's</font>

398
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,329
terrible I hate that stuff and it wastes

399
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,910
a bunch of their time you sign them up

400
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,290
for every type of spam email you can in

401
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,390
fact the actually have a funny story

402
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,849
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to use a asdfasdf calm</font>

403
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,680
as like a test email account turned out

404
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,959
that poor guy who owned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

405
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,420
account was getting completely slammed

406
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,989
by me so you had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his email</font>

407
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,000
account which sorry so you sign the

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,070
competitors<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams phone numbers up to</font>

every type of physical mail you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can this</font>

412
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,850
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> sucks a lot because physical</font>

413
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,860
mail if you if you get enough of it you

414
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,050
no longer can find the invoices buried

415
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,519
in the mail so you stop paying your

416
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,569
bills because you just can't find them

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,399
anymore you know when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a</font>

418

hundred thousand pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of physical mail</font>

419
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,730
a day you literally can't do anything

420
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,709
other than deal with that mail I mean

421
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,820
you're just you're done or just don't

422

<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at all and just leave your</font>

house like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hoarder full</font>

424
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:27,649
male right so you submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resume of</font>

425
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,049

00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:37,189
not a theoretical one and so what

429
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:40,008
happened is the HR team started emailing

430
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:41,569
like it's like like are we cool like are

431
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,790
you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave us and like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no why</font>

432
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:46,069
and so what ends up happening is a you

433
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,199
waste a bunch of their time but a lot of

434
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:51,290
internal conversations and hallway stuff

435
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,878
it's all waste of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it also means</font>

436
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,349
that that person is much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to</font>

437
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,359
actually leave because people going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

438
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,879
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say hey got this great job so</font>

439
00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:00,379
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose your best people so</font>

440
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,629
you mail bomb the competitive team with

441
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:05,600
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> landslide of overly large emails crash</font>

442
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:07,129
the mail server bonus points<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you send</font>

443
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,299
it from their email<font color="#E5E5E5"> account so people</font>

444
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,339
say please take me off your list or

445
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:13,279
whatever unsubscribe and people start

446
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,829
responding it's awesome so you can write

447
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forgotten all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their pages this</font>

448
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:20,358
is definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're already</font>

449
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:22,189
doing by the way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> rightfully be</font>

450
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,089
forgotten is really a UK thing it

451
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,339
doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in the United States</font>

452
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,239
but if it's an overseas international

453
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:30,319
organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a good</font>

454
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:31,669
example dmca some of their pages and

455
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,979
domains there's actually another version

456
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:35,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this which I just heard one of them</font>

457
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,850
one of the black hats I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to just</font>

458
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:39,949
email me two days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and it</font>

459
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,689
was you can basically sign people up and

460
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,479
say they are not paying their Adobe

461
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:46,699
licenses<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's they're basically</font>

462
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">using a bunch of hacked accounts for</font>

463
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,540
like Photoshop or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

464
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,519
organization will come down on it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

465
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,738
ton of bricks on them and like do this

466
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,749
huge internal investigation totally wipe

467
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:59,809
them out for months which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

468
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:02,419
nasty<font color="#CCCCCC"> autocomplete for the brand name</font>

469
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:05,178
you know spam and brand name fraud brand

470
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:06,709
name whatever and so when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

471
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,019
typing it in on Google they're like oh

472
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,490
this is a fraud oh maybe I shouldn't do

473
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,779
business with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just waste a ton</font>

474
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,230
of time because they try to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

475
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:17,329
that send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rbl lists so all</font>

476
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,189
their emails get blocks so more waste of

477
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,260
time like oh did you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

478
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:24,019
like Chris Nickerson said it the best

479
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,059
I've ever heard email is UDP I mean it's

480
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:28,490
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-way thing you never know if it</font>

481
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,010
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> there really obnoxious you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can add</font>

482
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,740
the word unix box to all of their pages

483
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,830
it will block all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Chinese users</font>

484
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">china does not like unix boxes you get</font>

485
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,490
negative reviews about the company's

486
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,350
senior management that basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

487
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that now they have dual is brand</font>

488
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,699
reputation repairing stuff and that's

489
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,360
extremely expensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a huge</font>

490
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,010
waste of time right foot articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

491
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,870
this seems like a lot of stuff and it I

492
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,990
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is believe it or not</font>

493
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortlist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fraud articles and</font>

494
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,070
basically more waste of time it's all

495
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,320
 and none of it's true but it

496
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,879
doesn't matter spoof email from the

497
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">competitive exec team to the IT team</font>

498
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,030
asking all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> garbage stuff</font>

499
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,160
because I mean they're like oh you know

500
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,020
am I hacked and like oh you can't

501
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,630
imagine that downstream shitstorm that

502
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,580
would cause<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of friend</font>

503
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,559
requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the exact team from ha</font>

504
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,600
single ladies get them to dump all their

505
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,059
information when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally do try to</font>

506
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleep with you send that to email at all</font>

507
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:32,149
at which total shitstorm it would

508
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,550
totally light up a company send a flood

509
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,500
of text messages to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT DevOps</font>

510
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,659
marketing teams during product launches

511
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,030
like oh it's broken whoa they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

512
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,800
running around so they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> know which</font>

513
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,090
ones are real and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wasting</font>

514
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,120
tons of time and they've missed the good

515
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff so I hope that's sort of</font>

516
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,050
demonstrative sort of demonstrative of

517
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,850
some of the things I mean there should

518
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,559
be a big old<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc at the bottom of this</font>

519
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely by no means no</font>

520
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,428
stretch all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can do and</font>

521
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,080
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the non technical stuff there's</font>

522
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,220
all kinds of really gnarly super

523
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,080
technical stuff that's an entire extra

524
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,020
deck I haven't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

525
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,970
through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all but this is it turns out</font>

526
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,129
much easier to do this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

527
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,559
than it is to do the hearts technical

528
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,850
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though you're thinking oh</font>

529
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,350
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about this stuff it</font>

530
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,659
doesn't matter the adversaries are

531
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,678
already starting to use this so if

532
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,080
you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with companies who</font>

533
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:23,030
actually have real-world adversaries out

534
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,340
there this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of attack that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the bad guys actually can do they know</font>

536
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,600
how to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these very</font>

537
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,120
unsophisticated let's call them

538
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,678
corporate bad guys know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

539
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff or they can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine enough to</font>

540
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,000
figure enough of it out to do it

541
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,710
themselves so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm wrong and i</font>

542
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,750
don't like being wrong but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

543
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,850
useful to examine when you are wrong in

544
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,659
this particular case<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spent a lot of</font>

545
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,609
time

546
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:48,739
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out why do bad guys like sequel</font>

547
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:50,809
injection I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font>

548
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:53,539
understand that it's a bad vulnerability

549
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,979
that I understand I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that dumb but</font>

550
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,299
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get why they like it better than</font>

551
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,369
command injection it never really made

552
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,929
sense to me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat down I talked to</font>

553
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:02,509
one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay tell me</font>

554
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:04,099
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowdown what why why or do</font>

555
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,450
you like sequel injection more like let

556
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">me give you an example if i gave you</font>

557
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:10,190
sequel injection and i gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> you command</font>

558
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">jection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same box and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd</font>

559
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,210
get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sequel injection nothing</font>

560
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,950
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you get is the data out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

561
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,299
the database and that is it imagine

562
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,039
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way to pivot there's nothing</font>

563
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,269
actually can do let's say that's all

564
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,830
lockdown or ending up on a different

565
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,960
machine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing's totally locked</font>

566
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:27,320
down which would you prefer he still

567
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:29,419
said sequel injection I'm like why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

568
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it command jection you</font>

569
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:32,779
get all kinds of stuff you can pivot you

570
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,918
can attack the source code you can

571
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,629
change it if you want you can add

572
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,669
malware and you can remove yourself from

573
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:39,709
the logs and on and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all this great</font>

574
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,570
stuff you can do sequin jection you just

575
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,190
get the data you might be able to pivot

576
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,710
you might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get effectively</font>

577
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,239
command injection but with command

578
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,340
direction you definitely get command

579
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:51,859
injection you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just never made</font>

580
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,509
sense to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and also from sin tax</font>

581
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:55,999
perspective it just seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a bigger</font>

582
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:57,950
pain in the ass you know but it turns

583
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:59,869
out it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's much much</font>

584
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,580
easier to do sequel injection because

585
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,529
really the only thing they do care about

586
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,928
in this particular case is getting the

587
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,549
data maybe they want to modify the data

588
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,379
in some cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is true like I've run</font>

589
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,330
into healthcare organizations where the

590
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:14,899
adversaries want to modify data to

591
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,090
change certain records so that certain

592
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:20,149
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are happening study wise</font>

593
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,109
turn out it to their advantage but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

594
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,539
the most part they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal</font>

595
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:25,849
the data so when you want get command

596
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,889
injection you land on a box effectively

597
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:30,109
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> says all right</font>

598
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:32,779
you're you got a shell here now what

599
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:34,759
okay all right what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of operating</font>

600
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:37,190
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> iowa okay you named ina say i'm</font>

601
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:40,729
on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> bun to version blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

602
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,159
it's like okay where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> apache stored is</font>

603
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:44,509
this version 11 points um thing or two

604
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,570
points something it's like this is two

605
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,999
points okay is it / etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick like</font>

606
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to find the directory start</font>

607
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:53,359
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around like okay okay the</font>

608
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,070
database is at a local database or is

609
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,530
that remote

610
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,860
like the stroll to the source code make

611
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,300
its java I'm on java his strings or

612
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,010
something and like it just turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

613
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,540
it's a bigger pain in the ass once you

614
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,700
get command injection I mean you can do

615
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,690
it and any sophisticated<font color="#CCCCCC"> AB adversaries</font>

616
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,790
going to go of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that</font>

617
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple actually but it takes</font>

618
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,050
so much more work to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data even</font>

619
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,640
though you have command injection then

620
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,370
just to get the data with sequin

621
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Junction so this is all like a trade-off</font>

622
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,570
right how much how much work are you

623
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to do as an adversary to pull</font>

624
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:26,350
that data out and it turns out sequin

625
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Junction is just far superior so let's</font>

626
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,730
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things that are easy so I'm a</font>

627
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:34,120
big formula<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 fan yeah we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kota here</font>

628
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,290
in awesome so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not huge for our I fan</font>

629
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,790
but I respect them quite a bit but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

630
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,159
listening I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TV the other</font>

631
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,260
day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve match it who's like one of</font>

632
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the nicer guys is talking about from one</font>

633
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,770
cars by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a sports analogy</font>

634
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,649
this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual attack so just bear</font>

635
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:54,370
with me for a second so Steve matchick

636
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,080
was talking about you know basically

637
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't do any of the strategy at the</font>

638
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,460
pit they basically sent everything over

639
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,229
the wire to<font color="#CCCCCC"> marinello in Italy and in it</font>

640
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,030
in Italy they do all this analysis on

641
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,160
the data all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> telemetry data and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

642
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,200
they send it back all the way to austin

643
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,410
let's say and tell the car drive like

644
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,570
this right and as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard that</font>

645
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,580
I'm like what are you doing what you're

646
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,629
sending it over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

647
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,490
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about you can't be</font>

648
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,260
sending like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two car telemetry over the</font>

649
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:26,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet you insane have you seen the</font>

650
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet oh so I started thinking</font>

651
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,560
about like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I do if I were a</font>

652
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,780
competitive team an example Williams

653
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,340
team the difference between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font>

654
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,450
place and fourth place which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

655
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,429
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are standing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now is worth</font>

656
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,980
millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars millions of dollars</font>

657
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:40,930
to them so what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do if I were</font>

658
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,480
Williams what I say I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> invest</font>

659
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:46,000
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars to lock in</font>

660
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,860
that third<font color="#E5E5E5"> place position or let's say</font>

661
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,380
do something else what what else could I

662
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,389
do well<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars and i only</font>

663
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,860
make 2 million dollars that's a wash but

664
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't spend the two million dollars</font>

665
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,360
I lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars so that's bad</font>

666
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,280
right that seems bad so even though it's

667
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,600
a wash it's just a wash you know it's

668
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the better of two evils kind of</font>

669
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,699
thing or you could just launch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

670
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">aisle service right so Matt you're</font>

671
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,740
handsome

672
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,110
and during my Grossman who work for me

673
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">or work for the same company rather they</font>

674
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:18,500
don't work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me let's be very clear</font>

675
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:23,510
don't don't repeat that I could just see

676
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,340
that storm anyway so they they came

677
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with an attack basically where you</font>

678
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,689
can seed a little piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript on</font>

679
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">AB networks and take over take out</font>

680
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,710
basically anything you want so they test

681
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,620
this against Akamai<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akamai's homepage</font>

682
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually and with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a chrome eyes homepage</font>

683
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,129
they were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prove that with about</font>

684
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,980
three hundred dollars they could take

685
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,900
down Akamai a coma right the company

686
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,940
that a tons and tons of companies use

687
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,350
for anti denial service stuff just

688
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,210
because you can flood the network with

689
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:54,469
that much traffic using ads so so what

690
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,910
should you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if you're an adversary</font>

691
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,860
let's say our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Williams or a crazy</font>

692
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,720
William fan Williams fan where I don't

693
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,189
have two million dollars to spend on R&D

694
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,520
and even if I did I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it the</font>

695
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,370
Williams would I would I what I prefer

696
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,070
to do all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> work or maybe just spend</font>

697
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,479
300 bucks on some ads right it doesn't

698
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">even have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be my credit card I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

699
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,880
somebody else's I'm good at that so not

700
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,800
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I save the two million dollars</font>

701
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,140
in rd but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also make two million</font>

702
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,690
dollars in winning on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team right</font>

703
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,460
so from an adversarial perspective it's

704
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,860
much easier to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> these low hanging</font>

705
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,630
fruit the type of tax I know they seem

706
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,300
less good than the right way to do it

707
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,130
from a purely academic perspective but

708
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,870
it just turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out adversaries don't care</font>

709
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,130
they just don't care at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

710
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,179
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk to you they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care</font>

711
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:42,740
so if you you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find evidence</font>

712
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these attacks are actually</font>

713
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,800
happening one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problems I</font>

714
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,570
have with like the last threat

715
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,940
classification although very good is

716
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,379
that it doesn't really articulate how

717
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,180
likely these vulnerabilities are to

718
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,980
happen or even if they are possible or

719
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,050
even if they ever have happened sure

720
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">academically yes I'm sure someone found</font>

721
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in a lab or created it or whatever</font>

722
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,090
I'm sure if you do have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to source</font>

723
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,370
code in some very particular situations

724
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,429
yes you can initiate those things but in

725
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,989
reality I just don't see it so when I

726
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,120
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> two adversaries I asking questions</font>

727
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,310
like have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever seen this type of</font>

728
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,159
xpath injection ever used in the wild

00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,679
ever even anecdotally even Keyser Soze

730
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,080
you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like oh I heard a</font>

731
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,210
spooky story once about<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

732
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,340
like know the answer is no not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even one</font>

733
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,989
time ever have these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen or</font>

734
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,478
heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it used in the wild even</font>

735
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:31,070
amongst their own community not that

736
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,479
it's not possible maybe it has happened

737
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,460
once maybe it's even happened five times

738
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:36,259
100 times or whatever but not internet

741
00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:43,488

742
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,599
real risk today so and likewise other

00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,460
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sequel injection are</font>

actually higher or actually worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I</font>

745
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,899
thought and you know me being a more or

746
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:52,939
less an academic I guess in this context

747
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,830
I'm always shocked to find out I'm

748
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,019
completely wrong about stuff so it does

749
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,759
happen but one thing I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

750
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:01,159
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a pet peeve of mine</font>

751
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:03,739
is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say like high medium and</font>

752
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,690
low severity<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I've always disliked</font>

753
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:06,830
it we've been stuck with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

754
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,419
still kind of stuck with it but I just

755
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because it doesn't really</font>

756
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:12,859
give context if I say there's a high

757
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:14,149
medium a hype of ulnar ability on one

758
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:19,699
site and medium vulnerability another

759
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:21,859
site which one you go fix right it

760
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,330
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the site if one's internal</font>

762
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,418

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,599
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones your corporate front end</font>

764
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:30,979
which one you go fix right the one that

765
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,539
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to get attacked</font>

766
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:33,979
right the one with actual sensitive

767
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:35,719
information on it so you're missing that

768
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:37,759
context and it's it's always bugged me

769
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:38,960
because if you run a US<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus scan or</font>

770
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,960
whatever it's going to say this is high

771
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,479
you're like I mean in without any

772
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,799
context<font color="#E5E5E5"> Navy but you know it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

773
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,539
have any sensitive information on it

774
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,460
it's under someone's desk it's you know

775
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,080
and behind the corporate firewall it's

776
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,059
totally shunted off<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in a lab right</font>

777
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:57,379
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high that's not even alone</font>

778
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,849
that's not nothing so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

779
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:01,609
important if we start we got to add

780
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,749
context to what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about keep</font>

781
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:03,859
the bad guy in mind if you're not

782
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about what the bad guys are</font>

783
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:06,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually going to do you're going to</font>

784
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:09,589
miss a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

785
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,599
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about so bear with me I</font>

786
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:13,969
know graphs are a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> funky but so on</font>

787
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,168
the vertical axis is what you call the

788
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:19,570
expected value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los post</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise so</font>

789
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:22,330
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

790
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,649
you had a vulnerability and you expect

791
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you would lose about a million</font>

792
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,860
dollars if it were exploited and let's

793
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,750
say there's a ten percent chance it's

794
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,189
going to happen within the next 12

795
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,720
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

796
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,760
hundred-thousand-dollar expected value

797
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,380
of loss right and there's a bunch of

798
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,510
other factors involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like the</font>

799
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,940
risk how likely is that anonymous knows

800
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:43,150
who you are and whatever right and then

801
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,830
on the on the horizontal scale there you

802
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,390
have the investment pre<font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised how</font>

803
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,399
much does it cost to fix a vulnerability

804
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,560
before the bad guys find out about it

805
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,900
before anything happens if I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix</font>

806
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,370
this today how much would it cost me<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

807
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,100
corporation to fix this vulnerability

808
00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,969
right pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward and then</font>

809
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,409
you plot your vaults so this just

810
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,240
visually you're already starting to get

811
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,340
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more contacts than you had</font>

812
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,840
before right<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a little bit more</font>

813
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,419
useful but it's still missing something

814
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,100
pretty important which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do I give</font>

815
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,660
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> about just because they're easy</font>

816
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,159
vulnerability doesn't mean that I want

817
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix it I know there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

818
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,150
security purists out there they say I

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to fix every vulnerability but that</font>

820
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't really make sense economically</font>

821
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,580
there's all kinds of reasons that's true

822
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,990
and we do it all the time I risk myself

823
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,250
right now right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

don't have any like plexiglas-in-front-

831
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,610
of us or whatever so I've taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

risk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that throughout life</font>

833

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:50,080
do that so what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

835
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,910
something like a risk curve so a curve

836
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,740
might indicate it totally depends on the

837
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,910
person the situation the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of different ways you might</font>

839
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,530
want to calculate this but a curve that

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tilts away like this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

841
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,850
what we call a risk adverse curve

842
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,070
somebody who really does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

843

business<font color="#CCCCCC"> models sort of a tipping point</font>

846
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,790
if it happens too often people won't

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,340
trust them or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever right and the</font>

848
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,409
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a risk tolerant curve this</font>

849
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a company I like to pick on oil and</font>

850
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,060
gas a lot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil and gas where they</font>

851
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a lot of risks because the reward</font>

852
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,320
is so high they're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> billions and</font>

853
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,880
billions of dollars so you just sort of

854
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,700
decide what type of risk profile you

855
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,660
want so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you an example how</font>

856
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,450
you might calculate

857
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,460
so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a vulnerability and</font>

858
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,830
it'll cost you expected value of loss of

859
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,900
one thousand dollars let's say it cost

860
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:48,340
one hundred dollars to fix would you fix

861
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:50,470
the bowl what yes you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well if</font>

862
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,300
you're the oil and gas you'd say no you

863
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,490
know why do you have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how much</font>

864
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">money they make picking up the phone</font>

865
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,750
will will not give them anywhere near

866
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,159
what they would if they hung<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the</font>

867
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:01,810
phone and start drilling you know what I

868
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,820
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no way they're going to</font>

869
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,310
recoup that cost that they do not care

870
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,360
but a little mom and pop a little

871
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,950
grocery store<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something they might</font>

872
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,149
say a thousand dollars is all I'm going

873
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make all day that's 100 and 356 of</font>

874
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:18,340
the or whatever of our annual budget so

875
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,169
it's definitely worth fixing right that

876
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,580
it's a good it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid investment so</font>

877
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,750
the curve looks different so you

878
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,340
basically asked that question over and

879
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,750
over at different sliding scales and you

880
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,850
can sort of plot what your kerpit look

881
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,500
like just just kind of mental model here

882
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,540
it's obviously a lot more complicated in

883
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,630
that but you get the idea and then you

884
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,220
fix the vulnerabilities in the order up

885
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,590
from the upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand corner down to</font>

886
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,360
the efficient frontier of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve and</font>

887
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,070
then you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix anything below that</font>

888
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,770
curve and that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people very</font>

889
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:46,419
uncomfortable people don't like talking

890
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,389
about not fixing<font color="#E5E5E5"> bones and i'll tell you</font>

891
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">why you have to do it but an innocent</font>

892
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,800
anyway you fix these vulnerabilities and

893
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:56,110
this is really cool because you can go

894
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,610
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see so or your CFO even</font>

895
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,949
which is even much more interesting and

896
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can say instead of you there's three</font>

897
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,010
sequel injections to command jection

898
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,000
there's a clickjacking and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> blonde</font>

899
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,190
this is when we're gonna click and

900
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,840
they're like okay sorry can you stop

901
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,430
looking Klingon<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know give me</font>

902
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,040
some real information I have no idea

903
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you just said what so instead I can</font>

904
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,470
say we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this amount of expected loss</font>

905
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,050
here's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money I need so you</font>

906
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,630
don't have that loss like okay money in

907
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,700
equals money out I get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFO's can</font>

908
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,140
talk that language that dollar signs are

909
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,370
what they talk they don't know anything

910
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about our vulnerabilities they don't</font>

911
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about our vulnerabilities</font>

912
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,920
but they do care about loss and if they

913
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,300
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a curve like this and they</font>

914
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,740
can argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you and say what is the</font>

915
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,149
math behind this you can show them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

916
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,980
math<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they can argue and say I don't</font>

917
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this piece of math you can fix it</font>

918
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,280
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a meaningful</font>

919
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,879
conversation as opposed to this one way

920
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,599
thing rhyme technical and your

921
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:49,339
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> never goes anywhere so that works</font>

922
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,408
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> until you don't know about the</font>

923
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:52,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">Volm if you don't know about your</font>

924
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,179
vulnerabilities how the hell can you

925
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:57,889
plot so you can do sort of basic mental

926
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:59,119
modeling like we have ten percent of our

927
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,859
vulnerabilities that we don't know about

928
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,319
let's say right whatever whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

929
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:04,968
numbers and they're approximately let's

930
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:07,099
say this bad you know you can sort of

931
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:09,409
you know diagram them out what you think

932
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:10,639
they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general right but</font>

933
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:11,899
they're still there like what do you do

934
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:13,698
about them you can't fix them because

935
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:15,439
you don't know where they are right so

936
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:17,539
what you can do is you can do insurance

937
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,639
modeling you can put insurance in place

938
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:21,679
to limit your liability to the point

939
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:24,379
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is below your risk tolerance</font>

940
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,119
curve now it's an expected value of loss

941
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:27,439
of a known quantity you know how much

942
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,668
you're spending on insurance you know

943
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,559
it's worth you know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

944
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,149
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

945
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,959
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the train if</font>

946
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,689
you're not already on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> train is</font>

947
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:37,099
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> a train get on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> train yeah</font>

948
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,929
all right good you better go on the

949
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,619
train<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way business</font>

950
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:45,709
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and I i'm also a technologist I</font>

951
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:48,439
promise so let's talk a little bit about

952
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:50,389
individual vault so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people</font>

953
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,979
don't like the idea about not fixing

954
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:54,439
bones I will talk you through it because

955
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:56,269
I agree it's scary as crap so first

956
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,619
let's say you plot along and let's say

957
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:59,479
it's something that you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

958
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:02,178
this is something we definitely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

959
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:03,709
fix this is bad command jection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and home</font>

960
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:04,999
page it will basically take us all<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

961
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is the end of the world</font>

962
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,329
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this is the type of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one we</font>

963
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:12,768
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about right or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel injection</font>

964
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:14,899
sorry my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad so then you're like ok</font>

965
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll outsource this to some third</font>

966
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,649
country or whatever is somewhere well

967
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,460
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some company that'll do for</font>

968
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,098
us or whatever they're way cheaper

969
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,679
whatever but whoops we didn't sign any

970
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:27,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">isolate the SLA is there is that</font>

971
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,269
vulnerability but we forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say you</font>

972
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:30,138
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix the vulnerability so now it's</font>

973
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,638
sort of like they don't they're not

974
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:34,089
incentive to fix it like what do they

975
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,089
care right

976
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,960
hello all right about the same sounds

977
00:34:55,149 --> 00:35:01,299
louder<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so anyway in that</font>

978
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,359
example where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have an SLA in</font>

979
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,069
place the cost of remediation goes way

980
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:08,348
up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like pay them</font>

981
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:10,420
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like like break your</font>

982
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:11,980
contract or whatever does all this funky

983
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,900
stuff you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do just to get that</font>

984
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,550
stupid vulnerability fixed right so

985
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,150
let's say as an example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would push</font>

986
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:20,650
that way over as an again then let's say

987
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,060
you're like screw it screw ringing this

988
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">company I hate this company they're</font>

989
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,790
really pain in the ass I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

990
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,349
clearing credit cards in that website

991
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,910
I'll do everything off the third party

992
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:30,670
so now the data is off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thing</font>

993
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,379
right so we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it being something</font>

994
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,599
that I would fix but maybe not right

995
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,430
away to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can't</font>

996
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,079
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> too expensive to something</font>

997
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,578
I'm not even gonna bother fixing at this

998
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,500
point there's no sensitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on there</font>

999
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,839
anyway I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care right whatever it's</font>

1000
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,339
you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a liability perspective it</font>

1001
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,140
went down far enough the expected value

1002
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:48,670
of loss is much much lower now yeah we

1003
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,259
maybe have some brand reputation issues

1004
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,670
if it ever were compromised but it's not

1005
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,079
going to steal the money out of the

1006
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,569
database right because there is no money

1007
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that database then let's say you</font>

1008
00:35:55,569 --> 00:36:00,310
install a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wash in front of it and then</font>

1009
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:01,869
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you know the expected</font>

1010
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,119
value of law stay the same but now it's

1011
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,069
so much cheaper to fix this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bone all I</font>

1012
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,839
have to do is roll out a laugh roll I

1013
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:09,609
mean I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to QA and stuff and you</font>

1014
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,549
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not perfectly fixed but it's</font>

1015
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:15,040
close enough so it's barely worth fixing

1016
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:17,230
it's not really a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal anyway so</font>

1017
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,150
volt have moved around<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time right</font>

1018
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,920
this is why continuous assessment is

1019
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,359
really important because you have to

1020
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,910
continue to look at what your risk

1021
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,828
profile is because it changes over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

1022
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:30,700
and then anonymous figures out who you

1023
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:32,170
are right and they decide well this this

1024
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,848
is a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're interested in and</font>

1025
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,730
brand reputation is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guaranteed</font>

1026
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:40,210
hit and suddenly it's something you care

1027
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,280
about again is everyone with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1028
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so everyone in saw the train</font>

1029
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,720
that's right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good I think it's</font>

1030
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,069
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us all to be on the train</font>

1031
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,259
because this is the language of business

1032
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:51,640
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not like it if and what</font>

1033
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,119
this might happen or something this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1034
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,529
already happening the instrumentation we

1035
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,630
need to create this stuff and doing

1036
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,040
insurance modeling is still infantile I

1037
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,100
think it's got a long way to go before

1038
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,779
we're actually

1039
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">err we can actually do this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1040
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,070
this is where things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going so but</font>

1041
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,050
the important part of the sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1042
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,930
theme of this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if you weren't</font>

1043
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:15,170
following it did you just wake up from a

1044
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:17,390
coma<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you weren't following it the</font>

1045
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,590
whole point of this is we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1046
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">more aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what the bad guys are</font>

1047
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually doing just because we have</font>

1048
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">found a vulnerability that we really</font>

1049
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,310
like and it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1050
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,900
interested in just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font>

1051
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">command injection oh I love it so much</font>

1052
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,560
it doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad guys like it</font>

1053
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,700
that it doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> they care and</font>

1054
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,770
doesn't mean they're going to exploit it

1055
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,620
as regularly as something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that may</font>

1056
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:39,380
be less like amazing or whatever to you

1057
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,880
personally or make show up as a medium

1058
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,770
instead of a high in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your and your</font>

1059
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,480
vulnerability scanner you should not pay

1060
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to that in a vacuum you got to</font>

1061
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about the bigger picture like how</font>

1062
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work in ecosystem and I'm sure</font>

1063
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll end up happening over time is</font>

1064
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,290
you'll have different data sources like

1065
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,430
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Akamai is a great example of a data</font>

1066
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,710
source like they have all this graph

1067
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,120
stuff coming in threat information but

1068
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,980
you also have underground channels like

1069
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,180
people like somebody's start talking

1070
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,860
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company you know you have</font>

1071
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">different companies doing threat Intel</font>

1072
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:09,350
that might feed into something like this

1073
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,730
or you might your employees might say

1074
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,080
hey we're starting to hear when we go to

1075
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,670
conferences people are talking about us

1076
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,590
in a negative way maybe that feeds into

1077
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,940
it right there's all kinds of sentiment

1078
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,190
analysis stuff on Twitter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

1079
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,620
like all that stuff might feed into this

1080
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,030
system that might design what your think

1081
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,370
your threat profile is from an external

1082
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:27,440
perspective also<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many people know</font>

1083
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,089
you can exist how much traffic you get

1084
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,790
all those things over time might

1085
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,080
actually change it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really depends it</font>

1086
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,220
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company depends on how</font>

1087
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,660
much instrumentation you got in place

1088
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,700
depends on what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build with</font>

1089
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,770
whatever budget you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying</font>

1090
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,879
this is a completed science by any

1091
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,170
stretch I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look a</font>

1092
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,750
long way to go but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1093
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely an area that we all need to</font>

1094
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,070
start spending a lot more time like we

1095
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,480
like even just sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> swaging it you're</font>

1096
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say do you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a firewall is</font>

1097
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,040
not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right question to ask it's just</font>

1098
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the right question to ask the</font>

1099
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,630
questions are asking are really terrible

1100
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,950
if you want to look at probably the best

1101
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,510
document I've ever seen not from an

1102
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,339
application security perspective at all

1103
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:08,540
but from basically every other question

1104
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:10,100
you should ask it's the bits sig that

1105
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,810
used to stand for like the banking

1106
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,890
information security something

1107
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,620
rather but now it doesn't stand for

1108
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:17,750
anything for some reason anyway a bit

1109
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,910
self assessment document it's really

1110
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,090
really amazingly good it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like maybe</font>

1111
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,500
like a hundred pages of questions long

1112
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,300
but it's terrible from an application

1113
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,670
security perspective but only says a

1114
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,890
wast top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten and unfortunately bad guys</font>

1115
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:34,210
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about us top 10 as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sole</font>

1116
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:40,359
way that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take down a website so</font>

1117
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Taylor credence love you all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bye bye</font>
