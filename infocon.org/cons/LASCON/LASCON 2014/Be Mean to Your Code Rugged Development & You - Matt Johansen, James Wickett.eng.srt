58
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:04,180
production is that like a you know one

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:11,200

64
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,110
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do security testing do you do</font>

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,600
security testing kind of like after its

66
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,860
efforts been deployed or do you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,640
kind of somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the pipeline</font>

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,140
or in the mix so if you're early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,239
raise your hand like if you're kind of

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,579
considered early in the pipeline<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok if</font>

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,920
you do it sort of like it's it's been

72
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,480
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like you know getting</font>

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,459
crafty or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> betrayed your</font>

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big okay no hey there's no</font>

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,860
shame about that you know feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,299
and then what if I yeah what if would be

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of mixed right maybe you do some</font>

78
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,930
some parts of your apps you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

79
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,930
well in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts like we don't touch</font>

80
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,360
that one because we know you know and

81
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,680
and then okay and then and then maybe

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like we just only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it a little</font>

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit for like pci or compliance or</font>

84
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,490
whatever so I see ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I mean it's</font>

85
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,560
like it's kind of what we expect kind of

86
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,570
a mix here and so some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

87
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,620
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our the</font>

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,909
way we see the world shifting and and

89
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,200
sort of some principles that we're going

90
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at for you know how you do a</font>

91
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,969
modern security team or modern security

92
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,440
approach and we'll also be talking about

93
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,650
how are you some what are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,990
practices you know matt has a ton of

95
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,840
experience in his in his life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his</font>

96
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,340
job about how can how could we help fix

97
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,900
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and is give you</font>

98
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,450
some real practical things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

99
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,010
will be helpful even as security folks

100
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,020
or if you've been exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> app sex</font>

101
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,889
stuff that still should resonate with

102
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,299
you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come</font>

103
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,439
should kind of click and then we're

104
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna at the end of the talk will do</font>

105
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,409
sort of like what does it look like to

106
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,060
have a build pipeline to some of that

107
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:54,039
stuff integrated but I thought it would

108
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">be good to start out with like okay what</font>

109
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,169
what is the world look like today and

110
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,810
and I like this awesome definition

111
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,669
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's pronounced awesome and</font>

112
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,810
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to add a p2 it</font>

113
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:06,729
because i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put because this is</font>

114
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a definition for this is actually a</font>

115
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:11,110
definition about the cloud and I so then

116
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,270
you could call it possum and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> P still</font>

117
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,189
deciding what it would be maybe public I

118
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,568
don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

119
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but but anyways we'll stick with</font>

120
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,340
awesome but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you when you</font>

121
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:23,139
look at these this list it really should

122
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,409
stick with you and you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think oh</font>

123
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:28,659
yeah this is um this is really kind of

124
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,400
where the world is heading I see part of

125
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,919
it in my organization i see start part

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,289
of it out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know people want</font>

127
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,990
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuff that's on demand you want</font>

128
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,310
stuff that's scalable<font color="#E5E5E5"> self-service and</font>

129
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,960
measured right this is sort of a

130
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,199
definition that's been proposed as like

131
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,089
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what cloud really is we don't</font>

132
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,800
have to like call the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> vmware</font>

133
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,810
cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have like hidden in a data</font>

134
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,189
center cloud like I know that your boss

135
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,139
maybe want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it wants to call that</font>

136
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:54,550
cloud but like like when we thinking

137
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about cloud and real practical sense</font>

138
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,469
from all the way from SAS to

139
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,000
infrastructure as a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

140
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,520
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we're what we're</font>

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,199
talking about what we're thinking of and

142
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,229
and it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in the</font>

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,569
consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> world it's like oh I get my my</font>

144
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:15,909
gmail application and it's like wow like

145
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:18,009
I I get email sorry I can email a lot

146
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,960
easier than I do at work right you know

147
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,219
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it takes a week to provision</font>

148
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,378
and all that sort of stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

149
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:24,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">old enterprise approach you know and</font>

150
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,439
people are starting to see like

151
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,529
commercial and consumer tech is better

152
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,870
than enterprise tech and so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font>

153
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:34,569
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really this stuck with me about</font>

154
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,779
four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I went to national</font>

155
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:40,300
instruments to do cloud cloud start up

156
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,729
there inside we're basically taking some

157
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,210
some tech and you know cloud enabling it

158
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:48,818
and in previous gigs whenever I would

159
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,409
like buy or acquire make decisions I

160
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,879
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm added like a</font>

161
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:54,069
whole grid I was like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it</font>

162
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,139
perform what are the features said you

163
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,069
know how much was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it how does gardener</font>

164
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,230
think about it right that really

165
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mattered to me</font>

166
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,840
you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a trial period look</font>

167
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,580
like and how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay for</font>

168
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing and you know what's the</font>

169
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,590
support costs and all that whatever we

170
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,310
whenever we switch to cloud it was like

171
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,940
really simple like<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an API</font>

172
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:18,400
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I integrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you with my other stuff</font>

173
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,870
do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pay you yearly big</font>

174
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,820
contracts or can I just give you a

175
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,940
credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's like oh yeah</font>

176
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,620
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you work you know somewhat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

177
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,840
you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like that was like</font>

178
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was what we started doing and and</font>

179
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,500
it really could have assessed to me like

180
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,539
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about the business of</font>

181
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,030
playing nice with others and like so

182
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,900
inside of the inside of security like if

183
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,059
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that inside of the</font>

184
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,409
organization and fit into those the new

185
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,220
way that people are doing things in the

186
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,919
awesome world that is really important

187
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,080
this is a long-standing business thing

188
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,090
that people have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and it's the</font>

189
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,800
you know people are more important and

190
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,960
so what's a skip through that and say

191
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,199
yeah influence the people in your

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,320
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's talk about</font>

193
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,850
DevOps like what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how does</font>

194
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,870
security play inside of a DevOps

195
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:10,570
organization I really like the cams the

196
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,479
cams piece sometimes called clams and

197
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:16,599
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also debated see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people love</font>

198
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff but this is a John John</font>

199
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,260
Willis and Damon Edwards they run the

200
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:25,630
DevOps podcast and and it's a culture

201
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,360
lean automation measurement and sharing

202
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,250
and high emphasis on culture like that's

203
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,660
one of the big pushes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps move</font>

204
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,940
in for a lot for many years they were

205
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like DevOps culture like don't</font>

206
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,669
don't don't talk about anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

207
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,409
like don't talk about you know your

208
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,208
chefs and your puppets and ansibles or

209
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,588
whatever like you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font>

210
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">about culture and like it's it's</font>

211
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:49,240
complete correction and a change of

212
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:53,020
course correction here so a short story

213
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,510
on this at my house we have a moon

214
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,970
culture my daughter is two and a half

215
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,550
years old and she knows the difference

216
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,770
between a crescent moon a full moon and

217
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,910
a half moon we go on walks and like it's

218
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,220
like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dusk and you</font>

219
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,530
know there's a min she's like the moon

220
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,440
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah it's like she's really</font>

221
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,600
excited about we start telling stories

222
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moon so I have a little story</font>

223
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,210
I tell her and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like yeah we're</font>

224
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,980
gonna build a rocket ship and then

225
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,870
you're gonna fly up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon and it</font>

226
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,790
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cute one day she like she was</font>

227
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,310
like she saw the moon she says I want to

228
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,050
go to there you know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like like</font>

229
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,339
that warm my heart as a dad is like well

230
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:33,490
math and science very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

231
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,260
but but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started orienting around the</font>

232
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,240
moon and like and then I started

233
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,530
realizing how effective this this was

234
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,080
because one night I was taking out the

235
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,089
trash and I like look up I'm like I

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,710
wonder where the moon is like what do I

237
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,300
care where the moon is right it's like

238
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,100
but it's like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I can tell Lydia</font>

239
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,109
where it is and we could have a have a

240
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,730
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I downloaded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an app to tell me</font>

241
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phases of the Moon and so I</font>

242
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,180
could be like yes honey it's a waxing

243
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,050
gibbous moon two nite you know and like

244
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">ed and stuff like that right and and so</font>

245
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,579
what the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is besides just</font>

246
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,100
being kind of silly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's like the</font>

247
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,950
things that we value like that like in

248
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,050
our in our culture dictates kind of the

249
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,850
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we value and so like you're</font>

250
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're tooling and your other things</font>

251
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you put around your culture you</font>

252
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,280
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what is what really sticks</font>

253
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,979
in an organization so you know there you

254
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,560
go and continuous delivery I think this

255
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last point here there was a book</font>

256
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,670
released several years back and you can

257
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,350
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trace back a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this to the</font>

258
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">flicker days whenever they said you know</font>

259
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,670
we produce we deployed to production<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

260
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,770
times a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody's like what</font>

261
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,240
you know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it started really</font>

262
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,620
thinking about what does that mean to

263
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,520
deploy what does that mean to deliver

264
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,290
how do we actually you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence</font>

265
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,170
how do we deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our customers and</font>

266
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,670
so these are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of guiding</font>

267
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,709
principles and then I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

268
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">arrive arrive at this conclusion that</font>

269
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are really two paths in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

270
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,330
security industry or like how we can

271
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,640
influence an effect kind of the way

272
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,500
things are going in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry and one</font>

273
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,910
I think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important so we're</font>

274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,100
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend our time talking about is</font>

275
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development and build pipeline and</font>

276
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,610
so like in a world where like code

277
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,769
commits and tests and failing tests and

278
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,079
all that stuff our currency

279
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,290
like security people can actually play

280
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,300
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well and then I also</font>

281
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,670
believe operational runtimes runtime

282
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,170
state and monitoring is also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

283
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,819
place like what's actually happening

284
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,800
while it's happening we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

285
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,389
talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for this this we're</font>

286
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,479
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really focus in on the dev</font>

287
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,639
and build pipeline so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt is is going</font>

288
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,889
to talk to us and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tell us like</font>

289
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,670
the stuff he sees and how it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in</font>

290
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:49,829
the industry apparently yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yes</font>

291
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,238
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detecting diffic and fixing</font>

292
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,628
about development is kind of the point

293
00:11:51,239 --> 00:12:02,519
here right is oh no Mike this isn't

294
00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:04,949
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when we kind of asked</font>

295
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,269
earlier where you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> security testing</font>

296
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,709
this is kind of where this falls in

297
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,569
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so do you do your security</font>

298
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:12,449
testing as you're writing code you're

299
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:14,699
doing static code analysis are you doing

300
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:16,319
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing when you put your code</font>

301
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,939
in some sort of QA environment and

302
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:20,519
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing dynamic analysis on that</font>

303
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:23,069
living QA environment or you just kind

304
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,329
of let's do the skin at the end when

305
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:26,579
it's all in production already and let's

306
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,959
scan it right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really important</font>

307
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,549
especially when we go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

308
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,248
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we asked is how often do</font>

309
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:35,249
you deploy to production right so now if

310
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:37,559
you deploy to production a month or

311
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:41,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">greater or even weekly you know or</font>

312
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,499
bi-weekly and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do any security</font>

313
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,639
testing until production now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

314
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,759
sudden you know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bug in</font>

315
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,639
production that you cannot fix for days

316
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,089
weeks you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially months if you</font>

317
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,769
can get developer time so this kind of

318
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,730
stuff gets it's pretty scary right so

319
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,470
some of the stuff we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been preaching</font>

320
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,149
for years is ok move that security

321
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:01,589
testing back right move it back earlier

322
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,669
and earlier in the process which is

323
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:08,879
still really smart but people like

324
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Flickr and and and an Etsy kind of</font>

325
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,919
turned this on its head<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they said</font>

326
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:15,479
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> we push 20 and 20 30 times a day to</font>

327
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,009
production and security people go what

328
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the heck are you talking about right</font>

329
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:21,720
like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you view that code before it</font>

330
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:23,878
goes out how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do change control</font>

331
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,959
prod you know what's changing and so

332
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,869
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know where to focus your</font>

333
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,079
security testing let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and</font>

334
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">I gave a talk at black hat this year and</font>

335
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:34,520
we were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of around two</font>

336
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,080
discussion at one point about this kind

337
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,640
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole realm of what we're</font>

338
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about and one of the guys from</font>

339
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,370
etsy was in the room and he said well

340
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,740
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable code existed before</font>

341
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,149
we started pushing 30 times a day you

342
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,160
know vulnerable code is a thing that

343
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,860
existed when we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed once a month</font>

344
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,350
right we can now fix it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

345
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,570
hours I stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of was like oh</font>

346
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah the room could it was like uh</font>

347
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,470
huh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they started nodding right so</font>

348
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,089
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a theme that we're going</font>

349
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go on for the next couple slides so</font>

350
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,360
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually give this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

351
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,620
presentation to more developer focus

352
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">people how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room are</font>

353
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,510
more developer than security cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

354
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but you are an</font>

355
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,209
application security conference so I

356
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">think a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be</font>

357
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:18,560
review I tried to pull out some of the

358
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,790
super boring stuff for people that would

359
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,069
actually be coming to an application

360
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,949
security conference but anyway so try to

361
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,660
try to make this interesting so if those

362
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,940
you not familiar with white hat we put

363
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,500
out a stats report every<font color="#CCCCCC"> year we publish</font>

364
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,560
that we have 35,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites under</font>

365
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,270
contract it's a really cool data pool of

366
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,739
vulnerabilities and this year we always

367
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,569
do a little spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it every year like</font>

368
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,000
we did a customer survey to ask people

369
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> develop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

370
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of questions we just asked you we</font>

371
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,829
try to correlate that the

372
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,630
vulnerabilities and this past year<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

373
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,800
actually correlated the vulnerabilities

374
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:53,209
by language right just to put a new spin

375
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,770
on the data and see what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of came</font>

376
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,410
out maybe start some sort of religious

377
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,819
war amongst developers because you know

378
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,110
we're just presenting data these are

379
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just hard numbers that we have we are</font>

380
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,490
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making any claims of one language</font>

381
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,740
being more secure than another but this

382
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just what we see right so this is</font>

383
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,850
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

384
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,279
vulnerability percentage by

385
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,100
vulnerability class by language so the

386
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,290
percentage of sites that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have in each</font>

387
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,260
language that have at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

388
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerabilities so that makes sense now</font>

389
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,670
so you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the heat map</font>

390
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,110
coloring is cross-site scripting is

391
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,260
everywhere right we've known about this

392
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,279
for ever and how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> known by</font>

393
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">press</font>

394
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,709
2001 we've known about cross-site

395
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,060
scripting and insight I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

396
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,888
know how many pearl sites what we have

397
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,540
but sixty-seven percent of them have at

398
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">least pool across site scripting bug but</font>

399
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,980
if you tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw a line somewhere</font>

400
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,779
near all of those numbers it's it's

401
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,560
pretty easily say half half of the sites

402
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we test period have at least one</font>

403
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,199
cross-site scripting but most of them

404
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,569
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a lot more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

405
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,160
branch all the way down the gamut

406
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:00,990
information leakage content spoofing so

407
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,069
vulnerable code is everywhere right this

408
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,440
is just something I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna spend</font>

409
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:13,469
too much time on this right what is this

410
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:14,819
I didn't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide thrown</font>

411
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,420
curveballs at me from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes ago</font>

412
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so uh I ripped out a lot of the</font>

413
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,779
what is cross site scripting I hope that

414
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,888
you guys you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

415
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,959
application security conference i hope

416
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,670
you this something you know what it is

417
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,790
at least in general terms and why it's

418
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,139
bad right but still<font color="#CCCCCC"> i find that how to</font>

419
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,579
fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> process mechanic still kind of</font>

420
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,569
resonates with a lot of developer so all

421
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,399
your hands go up that's really good

422
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:37,170
right so something we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> preaching</font>

423
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,519
for quite a while as input sanitization

424
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:42,180
right that's great that's phenomenal

425
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad not a terrible way</font>

426
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,569
to do it right there are better ways to

427
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,730
do it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> input sanitization is</font>

428
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,860
usually means blacklists right<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

429
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,689
means if you see this special character

430
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,850
don't allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or something like that</font>

431
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,920
right if you see this string that kind

432
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,230
of looks like cross-site scripting

433
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,589
blocking right this is the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> cat</font>

434
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,149
mouse game ever we see it all the time

435
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:05,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">where certain clients of ours just</font>

436
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:08,130
insist on doing blacklist and all it is

437
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:09,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we just you know break it again and</font>

438
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,919
break it again and very ok we're going

439
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:12,959
to encode this way we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to code</font>

440
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,339
that way when you implement a blacklist

441
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,679
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be smarter than the attacker</font>

442
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,480
all the time as the defender right you

443
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,100
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you have to be on top of every</font>

444
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,480
new technique that comes out every new

445
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,760
browser version you need to see how it

446
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,250
handles<font color="#E5E5E5"> input to update your blacklist</font>

447
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,919
that's a gigantic task right I don't

448
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,650
want it white lists are way better right

449
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:36,000
hey here's this input it only ever

450
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,409
should have letters or numbers ok just

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't allow anything else period done</font>

452
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:43,110
right you know if you're allowed to if

453
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,629
you want to allow special characters

454
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,290
still should disallow

455
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,110
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of them right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:52,350

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,979
a global strategy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> XSS than</font>

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:59,219
blacklisted but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> better is outputted</font>

459
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,929
Cody right so how many you knew familiar

460
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,000
with up and coming cool I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

461
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:05,940
skip right past it right this becomes

this and we're all golden sequel

466
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,750
prevalent it still is Robert how long

467
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:22,260
will be known about sequel injections

468
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:25,200
eight Christmas Day 1998 still

469
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,260
everywhere still really bad you all are

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of familiar with this I stole Jim</font>

he always gives out his password on the

474
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,730
y right silly but just really basic you

475
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,080
know what sequel injection looks like

476
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,730
this is kind of like our<font color="#E5E5E5"> first interview</font>

477
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,889
question if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to try to work</font>

passwords fluffy bunny you know and you

481
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">can just kind of edit the sequel query</font>

482
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,879
from there<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the sequel period</font>

becomes or one equals one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're in</font>

484

and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

486
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,909
sequel injection of little Bobby tables

487
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,080
this resonates really well with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

488
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,240
that haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it before but I'm</font>

489

<font color="#E5E5E5">I fix it parameters queries this is king</font>

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a black lifting web this thing I</font>

493
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,260
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could input</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sanitize like there</font>

494
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,059
are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that try to fix sequel</font>

495
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,890
injection by not allowing sequel type

496
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,899
queries in the input which is ok but

497
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,670
again you're fighting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> battle of what</font>

498
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,730
a sequel injection and maintaining that

499
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,429
when this is way easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameter screws</font>

500
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,770
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who write PHP this is what</font>

501
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:34,280
a parameters query looks like in PHP so

502
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:37,500
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look familiar to some people cool</font>

503
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,059
so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taking the user input</font>

504
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,309
and throwing it directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a sequel</font>

505
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,720
query your parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> you first so that</font>

506
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,010
no matter what that input is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

507
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,600
going to affect the sequel query<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

508
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,170
that's the gist of it this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the syntax</font>

509
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,820
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> PHP and all right you know a</font>

510
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,100
difference here is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java uses</font>

511
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,678
these ? placeholders and PHP does the

512
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,090
little colon trick cool look familiar

513
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,310
makes sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> room cramped</font>

514
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,659
queries not not too new ok cool so

515
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,220
cross-site request forgery also

516
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely everywhere we see it</font>

517
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,460
constantly we've known about it for a

518
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">very long time you know how to fix it</font>

519
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,140
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really easy to fix this</font>

520
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,389
happens i think this happens twice a

521
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,950
year I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has same exact</font>

522
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,510

usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> fazil for some reason and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think this was Brazil I can't remember</font>

525
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">but routers are just awful at protecting</font>

526
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,590
a stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh well it's not</font>

527
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">available in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so whatever we</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about process</font>

530
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,200
find a way to see Sir FL we changed your

531
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,240
router password we flash the firmware

532
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,010
and we're just perma in your entire

533
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,560
network right and this happens all the

534
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,190
time those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what that</font>

535
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,260
attack looks like for the router attack

536
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,820
you visit some malicious website the

537
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,010
JavaScript on that website can force

538
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,050
your browser to make a request to your

539
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,280
router right since people in the

540
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,260
internet can't make a request to your

541
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,940
robber but you can force<font color="#E5E5E5"> your browser to</font>

542
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,740
make a request of that router and do all

543
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorts of nasty stuff right change the</font>

nameservers you can flash the firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

545
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,120
think every year black that some new

546
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,399
things someone did to a router via<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF</font>

547
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,830
there's a talk right how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it</font>

548
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,620
anyone what's the easiest way to fix

549
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,649
this crap not okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew you're all</font>

550
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say tokens well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're</font>

551
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's tokens but there is an easier</font>

552
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,830
fix to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF the most people probably</font>

553
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,260
didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> is affixed to CSRF in one</font>

554
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,860
particular situation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> csr out and it's</font>

555
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,450
this right so your change password page

556
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,129
right if it just ask you for your

557
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,570
password if I force your browser just

558
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that request I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed your</font>

protection right little negative of

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,860
truth right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay tokens yeah you all</font>

564
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,410
said tokens really super easy everyone

565
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows what this is if you watched my my</font>

566
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,920
last talk i showed you a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

567
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,330
ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are stealing CSRF</font>

568
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,220
tokens and this is why they're stealing

569
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,740

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,390
unguessable string that is not known to

<font color="#E5E5E5">the attacker so that they cannot force a</font>

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:12,990
actually do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF makes sense again</font>

575
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,029
this stuff so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

576
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,940
showed you is just unbelievably

577
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,080
everywhere and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of we're</font>

578
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,929
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back in the developer land</font>

579
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,080
here it get fixed really slowly right so

580
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:30,200
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this chart is is average</font>

581
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,158
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> open / vulnerability / language huh</font>

582
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,529
Ruby's hard we don't we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

583
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,929
giant sample size for Ruby and so that's

584
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:38,970
why that that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes away Ruby's a</font>

585
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:42,390
cool hip startup language and they

586
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:45,600
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't afford high-end web</font>

587
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,909
scanning and metrics right so Ruby's

588
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,320
kind of our outlier that yeah we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

589
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">on there because we do have some with</font>

590
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,840
some cross that scripting and stuff but

591
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,890
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them we just didn't find</font>

592
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,049
enough bones to to show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

593
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,909
HTTP response splitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and asp is</font>

594
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:03,149
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those outliers it's like</font>

595
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:06,809
vol my default incredibly hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix in</font>

596
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:09,689
ASB classic it's it's kind of silly

597
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:11,010
right but on average here you see you

598
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,600
know triple digits all across the board

599
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these golems are open for just</font>

600
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,428
another cool data visualization of how

601
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:21,590
long these bones are<font color="#CCCCCC"> opened / language</font>

602
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going over my time as usual if ever</font>

603
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:27,629
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just open like so that was</font>

604
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,020
time to fix if they ever got fixed this

605
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just remediation percentage right so</font>

606
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the percentage of times it's</font>

607
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,120
ever even of a mediated period so blue

608
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,320
is bad I think oh no no no blues good so

609
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,178
one hundred percent of times some of

610
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,189
these right in certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> languages and</font>

611
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,110
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ribs bed so you're still seeing we</font>

612
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,580
just from the time that a site came

613
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,459
under contract with us to the toll

614
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">present day you know they only fixed</font>

615
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,610
seventy-nine percent of the process

616
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,470
scripting that we told them about type

617
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:59,219
of thing right if I starts to make sense

618
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:01,080
for language cool so these phones are

619
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,240
everywhere they're always almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> stepped</font>

620
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,510
n slide I'm going to blow past at a loss

621
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence</font>

622
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:11,970
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right soon now you know we</font>

623
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,950
talked about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> what does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

624
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would build a pipeline and how do</font>

625
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put all that together hey does any</font>

626
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,559
does anybody have laptops and they want

627
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a build pipeline you</font>

628
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,149
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the front thing</font>

629
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,320
but I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering we have some</font>

630
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:29,459
yeah we should use a workshop we could

631
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:32,129
do it kind of workshop do a little bit

632
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">of both we're like I don't bring my</font>

633
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:35,820
laptop to hear you don't trust trust my

634
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,889
my fellow attendees all right well

635
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do we'll do a</font>

636
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:43,168
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a of a demo but the whole</font>

637
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,700
idea is it that what you could do if you

638
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:46,470
wanted to and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make it</font>

639
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,200
available but or I'll all kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

640
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,340
help you if you're following along but

641
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,249
you can take we have a repo in github

642
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,199
you can fork the repo you can set up the

643
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:59,399
Travis build for it and like within<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

644
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,090
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes you'll have your own build</font>

645
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:06,928
pipeline with running a runny website we

646
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,519
used mac conda's triage application it's

647
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:11,549
a ruby on rails the application that we

648
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:13,499
stood up for it and then we run run some

649
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,549
gauntlet attacks against it or any

650
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:15,629
different type of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we'll</font>

651
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually go through that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll click</font>

652
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:19,529
through and you can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

653
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,210
like what I do it later you can but i

654
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:22,529
think it's a it's a reason why we're

655
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,779
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this and we want to talk</font>

656
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,570
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is because a lot of times in</font>

657
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:31,739
organizations well have a bits like who

658
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:35,879
who uses Jenkins yeah travis anybody's

659
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:38,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">travis familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font>

660
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:40,139
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Coco Travis is cool it's a it's all</font>

661
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:41,759
the stuff that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like about</font>

662
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,988
Jenkins isn't there well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

663
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,379
actually working on adding those pieces

664
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:49,979
back Travis unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's a</font>

665
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:51,238
real simple version of Jenkins yeah

666
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:54,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't tell the Travis guys I said that</font>

667
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:57,059
will delete that from the video anyways

668
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,229
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into that let's talk</font>

669
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what is going to be the test</font>

670
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:04,080
runner and a test runner is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

671
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:06,989
gauntlet gauntlet if ya familiar with

672
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,489
gauntlet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right so uh yeah we'll</font>

673
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,690
do a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of how it works and then</font>

674
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:10,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll we'll get through it you can</font>

675
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,299
actually see the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how it all</font>

676
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,089
pieces together i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's that's</font>

677
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,679
probably the most most helpful part ok

678
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:18,279
so it's built built on top of cucumber

679
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,529
really just as extension on

680
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:22,450
topic cucumber important parts about

681
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:25,570
gauntlet is it comes with pre-canned

682
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,149
step so one big knock against cucumber

683
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:30,279
is that you know you can like write one

684
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:32,889
step like 20 different ways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

685
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,359
have a lot of overlap right now gauntlet

686
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,379
doesn't let you bring your owns bring

687
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,809
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own steps you actually have to use</font>

688
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:41,289
the pre-canned steps that they have or

689
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:43,719
that we have in it and some people like

690
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:46,029
that some people don't but it helps you

691
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:48,489
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of nightmare cucumber</font>

692
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,749
scenario or you have like you know if

693
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,570
you've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've seen</font>

694
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,950
seen that before and gauntlet doesn't

695
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,019
install any tools it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

696
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,339
manager doesn't do anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

697
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:00,429
you have to already have that stuff

698
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:02,049
built up around it it's a tries to be a

699
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:03,509
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> citizen of the continuous</font>

700
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:07,089
integration and continuous deployment

701
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:08,139
pipeline so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean exit statuses and</font>

702
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,809
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it handles all that</font>

703
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:13,330
properly and it's an open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> license</font>

704
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:16,029
so what what does a gauntlet attack look

705
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,928
like this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how it's structured</font>

706
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:22,179
so it's this the idea is given when then

707
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,669
if you can say those in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that order you</font>

708
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:26,559
are now an expert in gherkin which is

709
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:28,539
the the language that cucumber uses for

710
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,029
this with it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a for</font>

711
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">a gallop but there is the idea of a</font>

712
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,479
feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> or like kind of a big big main</font>

713
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:36,158
story that you're testing and then

714
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:37,330
individual scenarios now that stuff

715
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,259
that's run up at the top where it says

716
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,299
that background<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets run each time</font>

717
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,769
before each scenario so each scenario

718
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:47,440
kind of operates in its own independent

719
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:49,839
environment and every time it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

720
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,700
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a in map is still</font>

721
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,918
installed and everything's all set up

722
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,059
for it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do other stuff and</font>

723
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,379
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other tests that you'll see</font>

724
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,119
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real basic one but you</font>

725
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,738
would do things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh like here's my</font>

726
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,629
login page set some environment

727
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:04,419
variables anything that you're wanting

728
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:07,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">to and up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make fresh every time it</font>

729
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,679
would do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and it's also</font>

730
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:10,869
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note like the tests there</font>

731
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,029
in the middle won't affect the test at

732
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,459
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> so whatever says the output</font>

733
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:17,649
should not contain those lines where it

734
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,879
says that then those don't those don't

735
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:20,830
mix and<font color="#E5E5E5"> match right so every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time it</font>

736
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:22,089
runs it gets a clean clean set of output

737
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:26,408
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're parsing</font>

738
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:28,989
there so this one is running just a port

739
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:30,770
assertion so it's like on example<font color="#E5E5E5"> com I</font>

740
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:33,920
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that when</font>

741
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,320
run in map that port 80 is open later I

742
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:42,020
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> port 25 is not</font>

743
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,760
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not listed right so yep 4439 I</font>

744
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,150
mean you can test for you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> test for</font>

745
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:53,240
anything right so do I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a typo in</font>

746
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:54,620
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so but the yeah you but</font>

747
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,150
you look at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

748
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,939
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

749
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,410
this all this is set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up properly and</font>

750
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,300
we'll see some other like gauntlet

751
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,310
attacks that that the pull through there

752
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,860
there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> quick links will have the</font>

753
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,860
deck up so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> can click these and</font>

754
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,790
jihad<font color="#E5E5E5"> James has done this so he you know</font>

755
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,020
he knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's cool right so not too</font>

756
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,820
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you heard of call it before but</font>

757
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,220
the reason we kind of go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

758
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is like that whole moving</font>

759
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,950
security testing early an earlier thing

760
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,150
now now you're not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

761
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,850
putting security in the security

762
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,470
person's hands and saying okay developer

763
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,149
like when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> write code I'm going to</font>

764
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,860
run my static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool on it right</font>

765
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,380
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the earliest</font>

766
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,899
phase that we have this is actually your

767
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,790
speaking developer now right hey you

768
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,040
already right QA tests right you already

769
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to write QA test your unit test</font>

770
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,840
your end-to-end tests if you're doing

771
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,210
any sort of continuous deployment or

772
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,020
this pipeline you're having these tests

773
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:58,100
right so just getting going back to what

774
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,900
James started way in the beginning

775
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,290
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the culture of okay besides</font>

776
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,820
when I click<font color="#CCCCCC"> this button it turns blue</font>

777
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:07,250
right when I click this button it also

778
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,590
doesn't you know let so it doesn't I

779
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,430
can't force this<font color="#E5E5E5"> button to BCS a raft or</font>

780
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:13,550
something like that if you start to

781
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things in security</font>

782
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,090
terms in unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests and that's what</font>

783
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,790
gauntlet really is doing all right it's

784
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,939
writing security unit tests with some

785
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,100
help of some outside tools you know this

786
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,020
is even earlier and now you're also

787
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,340
speaking developers language you're not

788
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,800
all of a sudden being the security guy

789
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,959
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to butt heads with developer to</font>

790
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,280
get you know hey hold on we can't push

791
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,920
this co2 production I didn't look at it

792
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,170
yet no okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey we have some bar here</font>

793
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,400
our unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests went out it is at least</font>

794
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,410
this secure

795
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,660
because the unit tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass the build</font>

796
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">past the code went out right I'm not</font>

797
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,620
saying stop testing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> production because</font>

798
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,060
of this right because that would assume

799
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:53,179
you're writing perfect unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> test but I</font>

800
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,500
just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a step back well</font>

801
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a good point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

802
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,820
another aspect you see is like sometimes

803
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,770
you fix maybe you fix a<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaner ability</font>

804
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,830
or you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out there and then</font>

805
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,970
later like you make a typo or a change

806
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,710
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

807
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,530
regression right now that that thing is

808
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,360
back so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help systemize some of</font>

809
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:15,160
the vulnerabilities and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

810
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">found through this process and it's</font>

811
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,610
using our stats report the screenshots

812
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,160
are showing before<font color="#E5E5E5"> is reopen rate and</font>

813
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,740
like we see these villains pop up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

814
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,750
we had a bone right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that we</font>

815
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,520
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> is every phone gets a unique ID for</font>

816
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,380
the lifetime of that volunteered so we

817
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,600
can tell if it's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same exact moment</font>

818
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,340
comes back again and we have a reopen

819
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,020
rate we have some theories of why this

820
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,280
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of happens but it still happens way</font>

821
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,680
more than you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect it to happen</font>

822
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">right one theory and kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like this</font>

823
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,010
the pipeline is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have this</font>

824
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole QA process where you put this code</font>

825
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,160
into QA and then it does this and change

826
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,370
control and yada yada and goes out to

827
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,930
production right and then we that we

828
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:54,139
find the reopen rate is higher for the

829
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:55,730
most severe bowls like the sequel

830
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,460
injection has the highest reopen right I

831
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean like really really bad stuff and we</font>

832
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,140
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's like a hot</font>

833
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,330
patch all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes out of the</font>

834
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,130
regular pipeline and out of the QA cycle

835
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,199
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got to go everyone's hair is on</font>

836
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,200
fire we got to get this fixed into

837
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,090
production yesterday but no one

838
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,860
implements if your QA and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

839
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,840
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the QA goes out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

840
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,250
right and so yeah like you said this

841
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,350
kind of standardized is it to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

842
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,320
okay we fix that bone make sure to write

843
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,550
a unit test with gauntlet so that you

844
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,510
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that balm doesn't come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back ever</font>

845
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:31,580
again period right yeah cool well if

846
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,770
you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> gauntlet there if</font>

847
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,419
you through the life of the conference

848
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you send an email to book a gauntlet</font>

849
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:43,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">or you can have a free gauntlet book</font>

850
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright let's let's take a look this is</font>

851
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:49,130
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through there is</font>

852
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:51,020
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a repo called the secure there's a</font>

853
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization on github called secure</font>

854
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,080
pipeline and then there's a rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis</font>

855
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,730
exam

856
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,730
so if you have a web browser and you

857
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,500
want to want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to github.com /</font>

858
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:04,850
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dash pipeline you should see</font>

859
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rails travis example now Travis will</font>

860
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,939
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to actually pull it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and we'll</font>

861
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,370
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> runs and how all that</font>

862
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,870
sort of stuff works but Travis operates

863
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:16,789
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> file Travis camel and you can</font>

864
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,918
see there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> real simple like okay</font>

865
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:21,408
it's Ruby up top and it says like a 20

866
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the install I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

867
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:27,860
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so it does like install</font>

868
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,408
in map SSO lies sequel map is up there

869
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:33,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq knees inside we have it packed as a</font>

870
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">sub module so it's inside of there so</font>

871
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's all this like before stuff right</font>

872
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like so your build is sort of just</font>

873
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,480
setting up everything getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

874
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:43,429
ready and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a there is the</font>

875
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,289
script we're saying we're actually

876
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:48,169
running before because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

877
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,610
really focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual test you</font>

878
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:51,950
wouldn't probably do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly this way</font>

879
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:54,019
for an app that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building but you</font>

880
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,299
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know maybe would but the before</font>

881
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:59,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">script is we set up some tokens we set</font>

882
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,730
up the rails we do a database setup and

883
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,019
then we start the rails server and so

884
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:06,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is fired up and so at that</font>

885
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">point this is the real execution of the</font>

886
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,969
the tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are five statements</font>

887
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,359
down here and they're broken up in

888
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,489
different rake tasks and rake is just a

889
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,409
just a ruby kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like harness that</font>

890
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,418
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

891
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,740
more it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's super</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

892
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:23,719
but helps you kind of bundle everything

893
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:24,709
up into<font color="#E5E5E5"> different statements and you can</font>

894
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,949
see there's different ones down here

895
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,500
once called that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network attack ssl</font>

896
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:33,408
attack cross-site scripting information

897
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wit leakage and sequel injection so</font>

898
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:38,599
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

899
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,190
and this so this this clarifies a little

900
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,330
bit on some of this but you see the

901
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:45,859
setup pieces and there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll look</font>

902
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,839
at these two right here the information

903
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:49,250
leakage one I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look at</font>

904
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,759
sequel injection but just just probably

905
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,560
that one so for this one if you notice

906
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,359
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's three different attacks</font>

907
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,580
and you can see there's gauntlet on the

908
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">left hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side and then it did kind of a</font>

909
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:05,390
path but it says email leakage attack

910
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:07,160
backdoors attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Derby attack so the</font>

911
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">email one is you know sometimes people</font>

912
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,250
will

913
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,320
will crawl your website and grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

914
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,090
emails of users or that they know of and

915
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,980
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a fuzz list off of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

916
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,410
so you can say well anything that

917
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,880
contains my domain name I don't don't

918
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,970
let that be out there right and I want

919
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to want to block that and back doors is</font>

920
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,109
like has somebody puts on something in

921
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,580
like some sort of PHP or some sort of

922
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,400
executable back door in your system

923
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,870
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known you know it's not</font>

924
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,220
completely like you likely but if it

925
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,630
goes off you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to know that</font>

926
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,040
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like one of</font>

927
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">those ones is like it will probably</font>

928
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,560
never go off until it does and then

929
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:46,010
you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh crap so here's what the</font>

930
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,230
email one looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and we're we're</font>

931
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:52,250
doing some of this set up a profile and

932
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,840
so inside of Travis that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

933
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,150
thing is starting up on rails on port

934
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,490
3000 so we're looking at localhost for

935
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">3,000 so this is all contained travis</font>

936
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,870
has its own build box that it sets up

937
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,459
does all the pre configuration and then

938
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,040
now it says I want to launch an Arachne

939
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,610
attack and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the modules</font>

940
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,800
emails and then the output should not

941
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,420
match you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> your domain is</font>

942
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,010
right and you could parse this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

943
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,760
sort of way there's lots of like regex

944
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:23,080
availability for you there that that

945
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,430
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it real simple for you to look at</font>

946
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,950
all right and oh yeah there's there's

947
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:34,779
that piece see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got ahead of myself</font>

948
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:37,339
there here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back doors attack and</font>

949
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:40,600
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a sequel injection</font>

950
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,800
attack so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is showing you know I</font>

951
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think something that's really</font>

952
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,550
interesting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how we use</font>

953
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,100
gauntlet and how we work with garlic is

954
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,630
like this right here this is not

955
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,880
speaking their language of developers

956
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:55,100
right why because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

957
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,340
confusing and this is like a sequel this

958
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,529
is a sequel map mad science that like

959
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security person knows but you know</font>

960
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">what like you know it is speaking</font>

961
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,850
language of developers like this whole

962
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,860
file right because it's like I don't

963
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what this is but I've been told</font>

964
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this is bad this fails like now I</font>

965
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,520
know I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem and it can be taken</font>

966
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,830
that way so we're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like taking</font>

967
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that knowledge that's been kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

968
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hidden away in the information security</font>

969
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,500
application security silo and we're

970
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,960
systemizing and making available

971
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,630
everybody else in the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

972
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:46,520
let's let's do a demo and let's try

973
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:50,260
let's try some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

974
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,259
this is our is their application

975
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,580
you're this place

976
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:41,089
all right you see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right so</font>

977
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,129
yeah so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our free application is</font>

978
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:46,549
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tucson my local local machine</font>

979
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:48,199
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there resemble this as</font>

980
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:50,089
cross-site scripting and other problems

981
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:51,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stand it</font>

982
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,869
up as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> like here's a rails</font>

983
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:58,930
rails app we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at if</font>

984
00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:02,660
you go to this this this repo and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

985
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:05,779
you can come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can just</font>

986
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,109
say about the repo notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> he had 177</font>

987
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:10,459
people working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> three minutes so</font>

988
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:14,328
pretty though that so let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

989
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:17,209
let's try to give 200 but look what you

990
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:18,619
can do is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see right now here</font>

991
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:22,269
this little button this is bill passed

992
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,269
let's let's click over there

993
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,320
right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the Travis out those</font>

994
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so it gives you a bill number 57 in</font>

995
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,220
ran for about six minutes yesterday it

996
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,080
has has different pieces to the bill

997
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,310
that we talked about so it has the whole

998
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:49,359
setup piece it does it first<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks out</font>

999
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:51,009
the repo does the sub-module updates all

1000
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">those statements you should look</font>

1001
00:39:51,010 --> 00:40:01,869
familiar actually labels if you see the

1002
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,359
before install and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1003
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:06,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> script which are those portions</font>

1004
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,619
right there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually starts</font>

1005
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this correct references okay here we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1006
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,910
and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their over</font>

1007
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:18,099
she ever be through a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them and</font>

1008
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will open up a couple of attacks so</font>

1009
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:24,160
here's the here's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> map attacker is</font>

1010
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:26,259
running so here's that in map attack in

1011
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,259
the end it's running there and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1012
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,150
see it's looking for port 3000 and you

1013
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,420
can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bottom it says I I</font>

1014
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,010
found that so I'm going to call it good

1015
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:39,190
you probably want to say like and like

1016
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:41,500
these certain things not available here

1017
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,910
we're checking for heartbleed and we're

1018
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,470
checking for heartbleed against Google

1019
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,899
not against ourselves since I don't have

1020
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,520
a search set up but that's another cool

1021
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,440
thing about Travis it can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

1022
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,940
outbound requests and has ability to do

1023
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you have some sort of</font>

1024
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:59,349
requirement for that and so we're like

1025
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,700
you know here we're saying okay not not

1026
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,470
vulnerable to Hartley that's what it

1027
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,500
needs to say and here's like the

1028
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,230
statement right there at line this line

1029
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:13,060
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right here right and it</font>

1030
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:15,099
validates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's see some other</font>

1031
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,930
ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> look interesting here's some</font>

1032
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,790
here's a cross-site scripting attack so

1033
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,250
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using Arachne as the engine</font>

1034
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:22,690
underneath there to test that and so

1035
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:25,990
we're like well let's look at the new

1036
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,400
password page and 11 really important

1037
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,140
thing about some of these tests is like

1038
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security scanners you could like</font>

1039
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,190
turn or acne on and like walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1040
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,599
day right and like depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

1041
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:36,940
site like you can come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and it could</font>

1042
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">be crashed or it could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know still</font>

1043
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,279
running or you know you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1044
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,489
really sure

1045
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:44,619
so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some filters in here like</font>

1046
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:46,150
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay only go to one page you know</font>

1047
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,529
don't don't go throughout the entire

1048
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,089
site because these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things need to be</font>

1049
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:50,409
fast like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't just put up a bunch</font>

1050
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:58,150
of tests in there that like take forever

1051
00:41:50,409 --> 00:42:01,959
to run see okay we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two</font>

1052
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,109
minutes maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just let's do</font>

1053
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,109
this

1054
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,959
so that the Rick file inside of the repo

1055
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,900
so as you kind of look at through you're

1056
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,270
like well here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the attacks</font>

1057
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,500
and let's let's pop open another one of

1058
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,420
the attacks to just take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

1059
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">real quick and so that was inside of</font>

1060
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:32,940
tests and instead of attacks and let's

1061
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:34,859
look at that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the email one so</font>

1062
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,560
again we're using that real simple

1063
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:39,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">gherkin a statement we're saying you</font>

1064
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,740
know given i have my testing tool

1065
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,680
installed when i launched this attack

1066
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:47,669
you know then the output should match

1067
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,470
over here and that makes it so it's real

1068
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,720
discernible like what is what's actually

1069
00:42:49,470 --> 00:43:06,020
going on and we could actually change

1070
00:42:51,720 --> 00:43:10,770
this so oops and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll say my domains</font>

1071
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:12,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right and then what i do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1072
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:17,369
going to fire is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commits</font>

1073
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:23,070
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> github and this is going to kick</font>

1074
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:24,599
off a new build all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this</font>

1075
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the update to the email leakage which</font>

1076
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,780
we just push it shows our commitment and

1077
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:33,180
then click into it and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let this</font>

1078
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,280
run the build status<font color="#E5E5E5"> so populate as we</font>

1079
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,779
go we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using the Arachne scanner so</font>

1080
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,790
it's not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just you know we</font>

1081
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,320
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hard-coded what cross-site</font>

1082
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,450
scripting means like we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1083
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,400
rack neat scanner and then we're saying

1084
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,660
hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like pull out and you</font>

1085
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,390
could do it with other<font color="#CCCCCC"> type scanners</font>

1086
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,098
like that's totally possible and and

1087
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,750
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1088
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:53,790
cross-site scripting types of attacks

1089
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:55,859
that they offer and I only want to look

1090
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,720
on certain pages on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pages that I</font>

1091
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:59,580
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exist right because a lot of</font>

1092
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,470
these scanners they end up trying to

1093
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:03,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">build a crazy map you know of your</font>

1094
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,368
entire site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that takes a lot of time</font>

1095
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,540
messes up your build completely so we're

1096
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:08,460
saying is like go<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the password</font>

1097
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,839
page go after this page run all your

1098
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,880
cross site scripting payloads like we're

1099
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,560
telling Arachne to run that we're just

1100
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,970
saying don't don't go nuts with trying

1101
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find a bunch of other pages to</font>

1102
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,720
identify yet this is this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1103
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,210
kind of a minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar right it's like it</font>

1104
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,379
it is it is possible to have cross-site

1105
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,090
scripting that Arachne's not

1106
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,520
and a pickup you know on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those pages</font>

1107
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,320
but you know you might also else you

1108
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,940
might also have it right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

1109
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,230
a this is like in the build pipeline

1110
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,960
this is where you can be effective

1111
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,700
inside of security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's this is</font>

1112
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,230
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not replace penetration testing</font>

1113
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's do not replace you know good good</font>

1114
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,350
coding practices all that stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1115
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of helping set that</font>

1116
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:44,549
minimal<font color="#CCCCCC"> book minimum bar across your</font>

1117
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:46,290
organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's funny like</font>

1118
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that people really like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1119
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in map one is like sometimes people</font>

1120
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,480
spin up new services on their on their

1121
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,089
pieces that you're like we didn't even

1122
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,190
