1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're coming out yeah like she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,490
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about DNS based</font>

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,099
authentication by named entities how it

4
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,619
interacts with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ca system and see if</font>

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,420
we can't fix some things just out of

6
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,950
curiosity uh who hears heard of DNS SEC

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,030
so nice pretty good size what about

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,320
dating yeah a lot less alright great

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,830
well this is gonna be a good good

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,620
starting point so who am i I'm Tony

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">cargile uh I'm a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security engineer at</font>

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,470
aiesec partners I get to carry a lot of

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,669
application infrastructure and pin Tess

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:57,210
anything ranging from white box to black

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,989
box mobile infrastructure web app you

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,110
name it before that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was work alike UT</font>

17
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,899
in Austin of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree in here science</font>

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,700
and before that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was programming and</font>

19
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,640
web application and configuration

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,290
management environments so when we going

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be talking today well I'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,740
just start jump right in today but

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately can't really do that with</font>

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,149
a good primer in DNS SEC and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,970
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dina sec without the problems</font>

26
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of DNS so and then after that we're</font>

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about you know what was</font>

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,280
what's the purpose of day was fixed why

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,259
is there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people playing</font>

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,660
security bingo talk about heartbleed and

31
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,740
then we'll end up talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:44,759
potential issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain so what is</font>

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,318
Dina's domain name system well hopefully

34
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,539
this is a refresher for most of you

35
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,179
otherwise let's talk might go so well

36
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:55,259
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh DNS is basically just a way for</font>

37
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:58,740
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resolve www</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be calm into an IP</font>

38
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,440
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> a client sends a request out</font>

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,160
with an a record type<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gets response</font>

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,190
back with an IP so what's with some of

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,919
the problems with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dina as well it's old</font>

42
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:14,670
bind was created in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1984 saddling up</font>

43
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:18,030
that was before I was born the RSC's

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,488
finally got ratified in 1987 so back

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,050
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time security was a blip on</font>

46
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,380
the radar no one was really worried

47
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,390
about DNS goofy cache poisoning or

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,069
hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

49
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,950
get the issues that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to deal</font>

50
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowadays so let's talk about the</font>

51
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">first issue with DNS and that is as</font>

52
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,859
provides no integrity no confidentiality

53
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:44,030
no availability so it's pretty trivial

54
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,790
to spoof dns so say a hacker it gets in

55
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:51,350
the middle of a client making a request

56
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,810
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns to a website making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS</font>

57
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,750
request if you can intercept that we can

58
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">just simply reply back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the IP of</font>

59
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,300
our malicious fake site and the client

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,220
simply goes there there's no guarantee

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,750
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that that clients</font>

62
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:11,930
receiving is legitimate information so

63
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,610
the second issue is dns cache poisoning

64
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,430
and this is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:20,930
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack what this is doing</font>

66
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">is instead of just replying back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:27,080
client saying that are the legitimate

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,540
sites at IP is actually are malicious IP

69
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,970
we're actually sending a response back

70
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a caching server and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I caching</font>

71
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,470
server is then going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send that</font>

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,700
response back to anybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> asks that</font>

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:43,700
server so what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

74
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,820
our attacker is going to send a request

75
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS caching server then it's</font>

76
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,769
going to spoof a response back saying

77
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,590
that oh woh kaam is actually 1337 and

78
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,180
then now anybody who sends her a DNS

79
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">request that goes through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that caching</font>

80
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,100
server well now it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond</font>

81
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:09,049
back with that 1337 for as long as that

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:12,079
TTL of that packet so originally it was

83
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:14,209
pretty trivial to do this um all you

84
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,228
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to do was a match the query</font>

85
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:21,410
ID of the DNS request to spoof a DNS

86
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:26,719
response so in that query idea is only a

87
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:30,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">2-byte identifier that you can just</font>

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
trivial brute force so the original

89
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,770
solution was just make the TTL extremely

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
low

91
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:40,169
but that really wasn't a solution when

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">de</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaminski came along and showed in</font>

93
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,390
2008 that he could just use a bunch of

94
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">different subdomains just brute force</font>

95
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,070
subdomains randomized subdomains and you

96
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,470
just got around that TTL and that was an

97
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,990
issue for a while finally the the real

98
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,160
issue was pork randomization basically

99
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,190
when a request goes out it actually goes

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,780
out on a random port not on port 53 so

101
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,300
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send our forged response</font>

102
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,330
to that poor get to also get support and

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,250
the query ID map which gains a ton of

104
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">entropy it's a lot harder to brute force</font>

105
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,480
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not a perfect solution</font>

106
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:22,800
if you can sing get lucky then you can

107
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,810
still do cat<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dinah's cache poisoning so</font>

108
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,840
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with DNS</font>

109
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">um there's really no validity checking</font>

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,659
so I sick partners com you can actually

111
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,080
you know register a domain of one sec

112
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,940
partners com you don't have that same of

113
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,140
lady checking that you would if you say

114
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:46,020
went to get ssl certificate for one sec

115
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,479
partners com hopefully you get denied

116
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,390
but we'll see later on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

117
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,320
usually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case and then also of course</font>

118
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,380
we're relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so DNS servers are</font>

119
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,930
another issue there's been some

120
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,900
compromises and DNS protocols so that's

121
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,280
always something we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of</font>

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,010
so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,320
issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS jump into DNS SEC and</font>

124
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,840
this was really created just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

125
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,860
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know Dina's not</font>

126
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:20,460
having any security by default so when's

127
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,130
DNS say DNS SEC provides origin

128
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,469
authentication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danis Donna it</font>

129
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,880
provides authenticated denial of

130
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,830
existence and it provides data integrity

131
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,529
notably it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide two things</font>

132
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,969
availability

133
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:40,579
reality so we're gonna go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and talk</font>

134
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:43,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how it does is it's kind of a bold</font>

135
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:45,079
statement to just say you know complete

136
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,049
data integrity complete origin

137
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:50,899
authentication but we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

138
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:53,719
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this so first of all it adds</font>

139
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:55,999
a few record types so it adds this are

140
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:59,498
our sig record type which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

141
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:03,769
hold the signature for every record in

142
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:05,359
the DNS zone it's also going to hold a

143
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:08,019
DNS key which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the public</font>

144
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:10,099
key for the signature it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

145
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,749
insect which I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into a</font>

146
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,438
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit later about for use for</font>

147
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:17,509
knowledge existence and then you use

148
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,429
your delegation server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

149
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,529
go over these all the more in depth in a

150
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:25,068
few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is really</font>

151
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:28,879
important for Dane but what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this</font>

152
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:32,269
essentially does if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a zone</font>

153
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,849
which you have each record type in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

154
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,579
zone you're going to make a you're going

155
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:40,938
to sign that zone with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key signing</font>

156
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:44,360
key part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me your zone signing key and</font>

157
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:46,129
that entail will be provided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,739
signature will be provided a way that

159
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,539
makes a request out to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> an a record</font>

160
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:54,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to get an associate are our</font>

161
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,179
sig record with that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the public</font>

162
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,269
key for that will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> installed in the</font>

163
00:07:56,179 --> 00:08:01,669
DNS key and then to provide a chain of

164
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:05,599
trust we also use a delegation signer a

165
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:08,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">das record type to specify our parent</font>

166
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,279
domain so this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little confusing</font>

167
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,649
this might cleared up a little bit so

168
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,209
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're at</font>

169
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:22,909
um we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign wao my bank</font>

170
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:25,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm well my bank Dom will sign that</font>

171
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:27,799
certificate using its<font color="#CCCCCC"> upkeep ought to</font>

172
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,409
keep hair and then when it does that it

173
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:35,749
will publish that is public<font color="#E5E5E5"> key also to</font>

174
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:38,240
the dot-com domain and this domain will

175
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:41,010
hold that DNS key and it will in turn

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,070
sign that key with his private key

177
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:47,220
and then publish its public key and also

178
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,710
push it to the root domain and that's

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,930
where this entire chain of trust lies is

180
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,650
in the root domain so we would pin on

181
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public key for the root domain um so</font>

182
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,300
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go ahead and jump into what</font>

183
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,730
this actually looks like tangibly so

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,160
this might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit small for the</font>

185
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,050
people in the back but um this is just

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,189
going to be a wireshark capture of a

187
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:15,089
request sent out so it's pretty simple

188
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,080
we just have a type a record request to

189
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">day good game jerry-san labs com looks</font>

190
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,680
like a normal a request or just one flag

191
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:33,150
that's been changed that says dns sec

192
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:35,760
approved or<font color="#CCCCCC"> cape capable so then when we</font>

193
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,360
send this request out we get a response

194
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,140
back that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much this so one we</font>

195
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,720
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response back with our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type a</font>

196
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:48,150
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normally see</font>

197
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,890
if we send a request out but then we

198
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,819
also get this RR slicked back which I

199
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:57,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">said was a signature for that type a</font>

200
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,580
response so in here it specifies a few

201
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:02,520
things it specifies the algorithm that

202
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,690
we used it also specifies the signature

203
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:11,610
of course and the signers name so that

204
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,160
now when a DNS SEC client wants to

205
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:18,000
verify this they can then go look at a

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,740
good day verisign lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns key and</font>

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,570
then they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform a chain of trust</font>

208
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,310
command to make sure that the request

209
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,560
that they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> received that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typed a</font>

210
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,010
record is actually coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

211
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:34,020
server it hasn't been modified and it's

212
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:35,850
actually there so hopefully that was

213
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,980
just kind of a refresher but so there's

214
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,630
some issues with DNS SEC right but they

215
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,300
also provide some really good things

216
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,510
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it provides authorization in</font>

217
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,250
and integrity so no more spoofing no

218
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,680
more cache poisoning which is a huge

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,730
benefit like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it's still an issue</font>

220
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,699
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to deal</font>

221
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,589
right now notably though it doesn't

222
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,589
provide confidentiality so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

223
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:01,410
sniffing on that network can well know

224
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,329
where you're going um there's some some

225
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,610
other solutions that take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

226
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,050
confidentiality if you want to if you're

227
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,360
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that people look at Dean</font>

228
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,719
s-curve that's a that's a pretty cool

229
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,699
solution for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the confidentiality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

230
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,620
DNS records but something that's a

231
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:21,120
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> out skilled for this talk so</font>

232
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,889
how does this house the in a sec take

233
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,290
care of you know Dina's goofing or

234
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dina's caching well anytime an attacker</font>

235
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:31,290
is going to try and man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

236
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:33,180
that DNS connection and modify it he's

237
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna be able to sign that are are</font>

238
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,040
sick with his own private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key because it</font>

239
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,610
wouldn't match up with a DNS key that's

240
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:46,139
on the UM<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fake site or sorry on the</font>

241
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,389
the legitimate sites dns server so if an

242
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:51,029
attacker was too man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and</font>

243
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:53,550
give its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's that DNS SEC</font>

244
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:57,630
validation would not happen and they

245
00:11:53,550 --> 00:12:02,300
tack simply fails so one thing that kind

246
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of glossed over but Dina sacrifice a</font>

247
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,829
denial of existence so if you send a

248
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,990
request out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to does not exist on</font>

249
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:13,079
google.com it will actually come back

250
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,889
and say that domain doesn't exist in our

251
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,810
zone and here's proof of that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

252
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:23,880
does that by sending back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sec</font>

253
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:28,829
record type so let us look like so we

254
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:34,260
send a request out to a ripe ripe net

255
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:36,029
with a a a domain that doesn't exist i

256
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,339
think i put a dot right dotnet right

257
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,160
here what this actually does is it since

258
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:44,010
back requesting that doesn't exist and I

259
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,790
can prove it to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there is in</font>

260
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:50,370
this one it shows there's 256 C&S type

261
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,099
net and e-learning dot riped on it but

262
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,690
there's no e dot riped on that so I

263
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,610
don't know thinking kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of already put</font>

264
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,310
the pieces together but this allows you

265
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,260
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do simple zone enumeration so if</font>

266
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,810
you were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go in and speed be</font>

267
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,160
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright is there a</font>

268
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,709
they're going to tell you anything

269
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,600
between before and after a and then you

270
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,580
can just go down the line and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

271
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,120
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all of the domains the</font>

272
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">subdomains in that zone so the answer to</font>

273
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that with a modification of the DNS SEC</font>

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,830
RFC which introduced insect<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and what</font>

275
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,080
this does is it just provides hashing

276
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:31,940
before it does a two checks<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the zone</font>

277
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,430
so here we send in this is actually

278
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,490
going to my domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> now e to me cargill</font>

279
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,160
com now what it does is it hashes that

280
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:43,630
sub domain and then checks against a

281
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:50,300
hashed a list of my sub tomates so now

282
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:55,130
it's saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay uh you know DMC bought</font>

283
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:57,439
our URL doesn't exist but in you know

284
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,260
the hash before and hash after it does

285
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,300
exist so what this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this allows</font>

286
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,620
us like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not have to crack all</font>

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,870
the hashes in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this zone to be able</font>

288
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,420
to enumerate it so that does provide

289
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,260
some security but this is just a sha-1

290
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,520
hash and so a big negative is people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

291
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,020
saying that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with big enough</font>

292
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,600
computer you can just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and crack</font>

293
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:23,800
all these all these hashes and get still

294
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">dude Ximena enumeration on DNS SEC</font>

295
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,449
approved sentence so and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well</font>

296
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">phone enumeration was I really matter</font>

297
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:36,770
but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen some pretty creative uses</font>

298
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:40,069
of DNS records like txt records that

299
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,839
hold passwords in it or you know

300
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about internal networks</font>

301
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,120
inside its own records so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adina's some</font>

302
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,010
enumeration is a pretty pretty powerful

303
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:55,089
thing so another thing on when we look

304
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:58,640
at a DNS SEC record response<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

305
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:01,550
containing a pretty sizable hash of that

306
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,880
record type and so when you know a

307
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,930
simple request of an a-type with a

308
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,990
spoofed source IP would result in a

309
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,769
response to that IP of a very large data

310
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,949
charm and so we could actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

311
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:21,100
is to do dns amplification attacks for

312
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:24,809
ddos we've already seen this in the wild

313
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:27,839
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times of using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns do</font>

314
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:30,160
amplification and DNS SEC would just

315
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
make those email more powerful because

316
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,488
it's quite a bit of information coming

317
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:39,040
back from a small response and then

318
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally like I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's a</font>

319
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,209
chain of trust right so we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

320
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:48,189
zone signing keys and the key signing

321
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:50,949
keys to validate the record and then

322
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:53,349
we're validating each um each step of

323
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">that chain until it gets that root zone</font>

324
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,209
and we have to pin on something so right

325
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,499
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinning on the root zone and</font>

326
00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:03,339
that's owned<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the government so that's</font>

327
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:04,629
owned<font color="#E5E5E5"> by iono and so take that as we</font>

328
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:05,980
will some people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> the less really</font>

329
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,439
good things other people say they don't

330
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust it so that's just more of your</font>

331
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:15,279
interpretation of that and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

332
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:19,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> component DNS SEC is the</font>

333
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,889
implementation so you know DNS I

334
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:25,079
carcasses<font color="#E5E5E5"> been out for a while the</font>

335
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:28,839
Runestone finally got signed on 2010 and

336
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:31,660
the.com zone got signed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> March of 2011</font>

337
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:35,649
so it's been around for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but</font>

338
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:38,139
as you can see with this graph what

339
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:41,350
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at here is a chart of DNS</font>

340
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:45,009
SEC implementation over the entire zone

341
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:48,939
so this top one edu that was not as

342
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:51,790
complete let's pod one this is a net in

343
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:53,709
the.com boom dotnet being the balloon

344
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop one and if you look over there</font>

345
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:59,469
right now we're peaking on the.net at

346
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,599
point five percent of all dotnet domains

347
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,839
are actually implementing DNS SEC and

348
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,079
even lower than that calm right now is

349
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:13,148
that about point three percent of all

350
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:17,799
calm domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> are DNS SEC approved or</font>

351
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:20,678
sign and a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny little site you</font>

352
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,398
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> check out is DNS SEC name</font>

353
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,370
in shame calm and it will actually see

354
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but you can show you the</font>

355
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:32,610
the top 25 and not a single one of those

356
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,320
signs their records with DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC you can</font>

357
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just put in named after named</font>

358
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,909
after name to this site you know none of

359
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,050
them none of them validate dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> f so</font>

360
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,960
going to a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> this later why</font>

361
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,580
this is but needless to say that's a

362
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,630
huge negative when we have the security

363
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,449
out there but no one's adopting it so

364
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:58,559
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a good primer on date</font>

365
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:02,510
um okay go ahead question<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

366
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,320
does it just doesn't do the same

367
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,040
functionality for the eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hatter</font>

368
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">conical side of the truth um you know</font>

369
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm haven't actually I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checked that</font>

370
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">so um yeah yeah um my thinking if I</font>

371
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,570
could guess right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so it should but</font>

372
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,130
Ivan actually verified that if you like

373
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,720
it get with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> after this i can give you</font>

374
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:29,940
my card<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go check that real quick</font>

375
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:32,220
and let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so after we got</font>

376
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good brief</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rodina second you finally</font>

377
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:40,050
start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> day so what is dane</font>

378
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:43,889
um dein is a way of being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

379
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:48,450
certificate pinning using<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns records</font>

380
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:52,110
instead of using ssl certs oh sorry pkix

381
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:54,990
certs so it's built completely on top of

382
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,790
DNS SEC we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the integrity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

383
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:01,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">veteran authorization of DNS SEC to</font>

384
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,659
verify our date records and its goals

385
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,610
pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just take away the</font>

386
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:10,590
reliance on the certificate authority

387
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,139
and put down the dns server so it does

388
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:16,590
with one simple record type so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get a</font>

389
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,650
TLS a DNS record type and what that's

390
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,480
going to do is that's going to hold the

391
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,990
signature of the ssl cert that you're

392
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,110
about to receive from an ssl server so

393
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,990
um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually check this by just</font>

394
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:34,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">udit dig for a TLS a record type and</font>

395
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,110
then it goes in a format of your

396
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,080
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be running on</font>

397
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:42,889
dot underscore the protocol that's gonna

398
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,720
be running on dot the domain so if you

399
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,210
wanted to see the certificate that

400
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,700
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive from good dank</font>

401
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:54,710
verisign labs com you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make a</font>

402
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:58,130
TLS a request to that URL is that's up

403
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:01,160
there so what does the TLS a wreck your

404
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,450
type actually look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

405
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,610
pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just got three</font>

406
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,040
different fields plus the actual

407
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,229
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go over these</font>

408
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,850
fields but their certificate usage the

409
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,690
selector and the matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> type and then</font>

410
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:17,120
a signature so first of all what's that

411
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">selector so we can actually say that</font>

412
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify a full</font>

413
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,930
certificate or we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

414
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:26,360
specify the subject subject public key

415
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:30,440
info so we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the full</font>

416
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:34,010
cert or on that just a simple field we

417
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,550
can use uh we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a one for one match</font>

418
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,920
so the full binary certificate will be

419
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:44,210
in that record type or we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

420
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">sha-256 sha-512 in Danes RFC extra</font>

421
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,760
supports expanding algorithms but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

422
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,030
most interesting field by far is a

423
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate usage field so what this is</font>

424
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to split this field specifies is</font>

425
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,879
what kind of searching ticket are we

426
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,469
going to be receiving<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,120
going to handle the search idiot once we

428
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:08,300
do receive it so say we get a signature

429
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,399
back for a certificate and then we use

430
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the certificate usage of zero well this</font>

431
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,340
will give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a CA constraints so</font>

432
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,630
basically this is saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

433
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,560
specified the certificate of a pkix

434
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,870
approved so be in your trusted store

435
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,389
certificate route so we can say we don't

436
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use anybody other than verisign</font>

437
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,580
labs com for this certificate that

438
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,899
you're about to receive similarly if you

439
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:38,840
specified one not only does this search

440
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,330
if you have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified by pkix we're</font>

441
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,189
saying that that exact certificate has

442
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,800
to be the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we received from from</font>

443
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,960
the ssl cert so even if it does verify

444
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,210
it goes

445
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,250
the PK x checking and it's a legitimate

446
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,029
certificate it's gotta be the one that

447
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,770
we specified in that a TLS a record<font color="#CCCCCC"> type</font>

448
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:59,590
and then conversely<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and three are</font>

449
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:04,059
similar but the exact opposite so we're

450
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:06,549
saying that the the we're going to if we

451
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:10,629
specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> two it would be a certificate</font>

452
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:12,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there gets verified as a trust</font>

453
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,029
anchor but it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

454
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:19,330
verified<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a public key infrastructure</font>

455
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:22,149
so we could create<font color="#E5E5E5"> as ssl cert that we</font>

456
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,279
then sign other search for and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

457
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:29,559
actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as our trusted CA</font>

458
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:32,559
basically without at<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a actual</font>

459
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:34,620
trusted CA and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font>

460
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,850
we call it kind of like cert penny is

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,100
this is a certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you get in the response well like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

certificate usage the matching type in

the selector as well as a signature so

478
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:31,000
this right here that 03 thing that's

479

this TLS a record was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> validated</font>

485
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:56,060
using DNS SEC so how does this stop you

<font color="#E5E5E5">if a ssl shirt was compromised we can</font>

now say through DNS SEC we can verify

512
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,870
of 2011 this happened in August

twenty-ninth of that year<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

514
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:22,679
finally revoked that certificate using

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:24,360
crl another example did you certainly

516

they were intermediary CA for interest

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,930
and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> November third they started</font>

520
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,570
releasing really poor quality

521
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:42,960
certificates editor like 512 bit RSA

522
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,820
keys they didn't have a lot of the

523
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,500
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are required by ssl certs</font>

524
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,580
and they were given to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Malaysian</font>

525
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,740
government and and the day it was

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,820
realized in November third<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla</font>

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,260
finally used revo keishon on November 17

528
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,879
so about two weeks before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were able</font>

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:05,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually even push out of the</font>

530
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:09,260
relocation so one of these two

531
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:12,050
kind of signify well one I compromising

532
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,560
the chain completely compromises the

533
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,840
entire chain of trust you know if if did

534
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,320
you search<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised then not only is</font>

535
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,510
this the ssl certs that digi cert has

536
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,189
already signed compromised but the

537
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,760
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> system is compromised because</font>

538
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:31,850
there are CA we've completely trusted

539
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,730
them for the security of say our HTTPS

540
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,909
traffic and then also once a certificate

541
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,740
once a compromise has happened it's

542
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">incredibly difficult to revoke eight</font>

543
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,830
that because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that our</font>

544
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,480
relocation system currently is and thing

545
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,000
is perfect for fixing both of these

546
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,100
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> one depending on the DNS</font>

547
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,740
completely eliminates the need for a CA

548
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,310
system you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said we can</font>

549
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,860
actually pin on an ssl cert and now that

550
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,190
we control you know our organization

551
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,129
owns that<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server we now own the</font>

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,520
security force a our HTTPS traffic and

553
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,010
then also it handles reeve occasion

554
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really elegantly and it's kind of a side</font>

555
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,710
effect that no one's really talking

556
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,730
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but it's I think</font>

557
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be noted</font>

558
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,870
speaking of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> location how are we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doing relocation right now and really</font>

560
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:31,280
there's two two answers there's crls in

561
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:34,460
OC SPS CR l's are basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alyssa gets</font>

562
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,020
pushed out set you know specifying you

563
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,240
know which ssl certs have been

564
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,570
compromised or rolled out or no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

565
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,370
valid and it's it's too large you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

566
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no way it's scalable</font>

567
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:48,979
that's a huge list and so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

568
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,220
too large they got cut out like a bunch

<font color="#E5E5E5">of them and it's not comprehensive and</font>

570
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">also if we don't get this list we can't</font>

571
00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:01,130
just shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down our CA checking system</font>

572
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:03,149
because like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you d-don't a crl server</font>

573
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:06,119
then just take down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entire</font>

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:10,399
or at least all<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and then</font>

575
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:15,449
similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocsp this is more of a /</font>

576
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:18,918
receiving a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA signed cert it checks to</font>

577
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:21,089
see if it's a valid certificate and

578
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,369
again they've got issues with like

579
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:26,549
you're constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocsp servers</font>

580
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:31,199
to check for searching validation and

581
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:32,190
again it's a fail open system so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

582
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">said we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

583
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,710
heartbleed here so you know an

584
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,359
interesting consequence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heartlake was</font>

585
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,419
that everybody thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> there see a</font>

586
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:45,379
surplice was compromised and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

587
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,389
everybody wanted to revoke their

588
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:49,918
certificate and publish a new one but

589
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:52,649
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's just really no way of</font>

590
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,279
handling this currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> um Adam Langley</font>

591
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">from google basically specified that you</font>

592
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:01,739
know chrome uses a mixture of crl<font color="#CCCCCC"> no CSP</font>

593
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,718
and either one who can handle a

594
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:09,179
relocation properly earth are

595
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:12,119
significantly enough to revote mass

596
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:15,200
amounts and certificates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane he</font>

597
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,939
knows this really well so say<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

598
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,429
certificate guest gets compromised well

599
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,159
now all you do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know create a new</font>

600
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:26,820
certificate pushed up to https server or

601
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:29,759
whatever server and then simply update

602
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,789
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS record with the signature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

603
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,169
your new certificate and now you have

604
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:36,149
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion on a clean separate</font>

605
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,159
certificate and if anybody uses that

606
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,809
compromised cert to try and meet an

607
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,359
earlier connection it won't be valid

608
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:47,039
because the TLS a record type takes care

609
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:49,019
of that so you know yeah we have these

610
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,089
problems with the ca sir but there's

611
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:54,089
there's also problems with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server</font>

612
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:56,700
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know with their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CEA system it's</font>

613
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:58,889
not really any longer a chain of trust

614
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,320
more web of trust just because you know

615
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:04,459
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> so many intermarry intermediary</font>

616
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">cas out there and you know anyone</font>

617
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:13,040
can you pop whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> adina's a ding dns</font>

618
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,030

622
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:30,290
traffic and so and then there's there's

623
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,710
some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with like you know</font>

624
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,200
with your CSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have multiple root</font>

625
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,090
trusted cas whereas this one only used

626
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,770
one and that's a government so that's

627
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,949
really kind of a pro and<font color="#E5E5E5"> con depending</font>

628
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">on how you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that um you know the</font>

629
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:49,610
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that run those cas are</font>

630
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:51,650
multinational conglomerates a new sim

631
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,620
and tech Komodo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Go Daddy globalsign</font>

632
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,540
those are the big ones versus this one's

633
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,780
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be owned by iono and then</font>

634
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that own those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and then</font>

635
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,770
that's going to kind of change when we

636
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,000
have all these generic Quixote's coming

637
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,700
out because<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have a lot</font>

638
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different separate companies like me</font>

639
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,780
there may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish DNS SEC</font>

640
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,200
validated records so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

641
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:19,190
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch out for and then</font>

642
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,590
protections in the SSL handshake you

643
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:23,930
know at least with the ca system it's

644
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,699
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one protocol right it's all in</font>

645
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:27,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL protocol whereas now we're kind</font>

646
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,240
of breaking it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a second</font>

647
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:31,159
protocol to handle this so there's some

648
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,710
introduction of some more attack surface

649
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,940
by using two protocols and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one</font>

650
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:40,160
to validate our ssl traffic and then you

651
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,720
know something to look at is your how

652
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,890
many cas have been compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

653
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,680
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers have been</font>

654
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:48,200
compromised and you know what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

655
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,960
decide to move towards a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS based</font>

656
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,340
approach to security<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm definitely</font>

657
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,890
think that we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a</font>

658
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,110
lot more DNS compromises but there's

659
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:00,050
already been some significant ones just

660
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:04,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at ms 1105</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eight huge</font>

661
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:07,040
compromise and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's DNS so</font>

662
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,050
luckily not to choose though because

663
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I said with the certificate usage</font>

664
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:15,070
we could actually pin not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only using TLS</font>

665
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,110
a but also using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your see</font>

666
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,210
using certificate usage one which

667
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,658
basically says this certificate has to

668
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,460
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> validated by PKA is but it also has</font>

669
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be the certificate that we valid that</font>

670
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">we specified and this TLS a record type</font>

671
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,370
so I'm starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run out of time here</font>

672
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:37,240
something she's going to jump over that

673
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,070
um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> well again we have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue with</font>

674
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,269
with implementation and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

675
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:43,029
going to be it's because it's a

676
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:44,649
bootstrap protocol right so no one wants

677
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:48,070
to implement Dane no one wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

678
00:32:44,649 --> 00:32:50,049
implement DNS SEC because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's protocol</font>

679
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,149
that no one uses and no one uses it

680
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:56,408
because no one implements it so there's

681
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:59,018
kind of chicken or egg situation and you

682
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:02,500
know like i said point<font color="#E5E5E5"> three of calm</font>

683
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:05,230
uses DNS SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> like handful of sites used</font>

684
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and right now there's a really good</font>

685
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">toilet their cult in a sec validator</font>

686
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:13,059
that'll actually you know check for TLS

687
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,980
a records as and as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS SEC so</font>

688
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,289
check that out if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

689
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,490
actually using that for your client

690
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:21,129
there's a couple of good sites i can

691
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually test that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a date any</font>

692
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:26,080
cargo<font color="#CCCCCC"> com that will be validate that is</font>

693
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,809
validated by TLS a liquor types as well

694
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,158
as good Dame de veras I'm labs com and

695
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:32,440
also if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check out your</font>

696
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,009
validators<font color="#CCCCCC"> worky there's bad day at</font>

697
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,929
verisign labs com as well so um well the

698
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:41,289
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took a look at this was</font>

699
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,940
because NCC domain services mcc sub

700
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:45,669
parent company for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sake partners and</font>

701
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,159
actually releasing this new TLD called

702
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:50,740
trust and what it basically does is it

703
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,970
requires that anybody in that TLD to get

704
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:57,340
in regular penetration testing and they

705
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,580
have to comply to a rigor set standards

706
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,459
to be in the dot trust TLD and one of

707
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,230
those standards is that they have to be

708
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,440
using Dane and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using DNS</font>

709
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC so I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really great sign</font>

710
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,460
that we're you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

711
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,918
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more there's a reason</font>

712
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">why people are talking about this a lot</font>

713
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">more you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be implemented yet</font>

714
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:21,489
but good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

715
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,819
start you know looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the security</font>

716
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:26,560
of this before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets implemented any</font>

717
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:28,029
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going with that</font>

718
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,920
what can you do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's three</font>

719
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,540
different ways of<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at what can</font>

720
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,180
you do if you actually believe in dane

721
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,670
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS egg and as builders breakers or</font>

722
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:41,080
hand shakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if your builder</font>

723
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:42,730
obviously this kind of plies to you you

724
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,100
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a web server maintainer</font>

725
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,830
why not sign your zone with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA or</font>

726
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:50,159
if you're an application developer why

727
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:54,520
not build into your HTTPS stack

728
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,920
validation for four day um also breakers

729
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,170
so the stuff definitely is going to need

730
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,050
testing right so we're building new code

731
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:06,280
it's using crypto so<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugging you see or</font>

732
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:08,920
some native language code to write the

733
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,180
validation for this date and DNS SEC and

734
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,580
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start putting this in a</font>

735
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,359
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clients if it picks off</font>

736
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,819
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it picks up so um and already we're</font>

737
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,480
kind of starting to see that a recent on

738
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:27,070
2013 there was actually a arbitrary code

739
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,770
execution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> GNU TLS in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their day</font>

740
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,540
validators so I think you know for

741
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like me that get paid to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

742
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,960
break things I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to see</font>

743
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,810
a lot of issues with breaking things in

744
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,640
Dane and DNS SEC for developers that

745
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,490
aren't paying attention to this new code

746
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,040
and finally hand shakers<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know</font>

747
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,660
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said no one is adopting this</font>

748
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,250
right now and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take some</font>

749
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:56,049
pushing from IT pushing from

750
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,420
organizational standpoint just to

751
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:04,480
finally get you know Dana DNS SEC into

752
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:07,840
Google and to you know any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your Alexa</font>

753
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,300
top 25 or top 100 you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

754
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,960
start communicating with upper

755
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:17,740
management that you know this is why we

756
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:21,160
need um DNS SEC and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

757
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,359
provide for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organization so I kind</font>

758
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,259
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rushes that last bit because we're</font>

759
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,720
kind of running out of time once you

760
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:27,850
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> get be able to get to launch here</font>

761
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,980
but do you guys have any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

762
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:33,520
why just went over

763
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,440
yes not yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've to question why he</font>

764
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,570
mentioned a handful people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you can</font>

765
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,010
gain do you know like close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

766
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,980
numbers whatever you had like the

767
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:44,590
percentages for DSS like we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

768
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,119
maybe 10 I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low</font>

769
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:50,380
I don't I don't know the exact number

770
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:52,390
but like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to tally no well</font>

771
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:56,320
and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm a huge advocate of</font>

772
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:58,420
XL finish<font color="#CCCCCC"> up like that waters for the</font>

773
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,580
hurdles to keep all of the signatures

774
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,710
that you're keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> any game 7s melted</font>

775
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,540
and gets up to date right so that when

776
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,609
you actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wants to keep</font>

777
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:09,279
inning on a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction correct</font>

778
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:11,020
yeah so that doesn't big like a a lot of

779
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like to complain about Wally you</font>

780
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,480
know there's some some standards for

781
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:19,450
like how long do you keep yours Arizona

782
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign for how often do you resize that</font>

783
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:26,080
kind of thing and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC they kind of</font>

784
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,440
specify using an HSM to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold</font>

785
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,759
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your keys off the server and then</font>

786
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,160
you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of automated</font>

787
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,380
pooling of that aspect but that's going

788
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more of an organizational decision</font>

789
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:43,330
um but kind of going with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font>

790
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">bond is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now released to set tools that</font>

791
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,980
really makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy like Reese</font>

792
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:51,240
on your zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced a key rotation</font>

793
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:55,690
so those solutions are becoming more

794
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,879
more available<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the larger that DNS</font>

795
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,500
second dank it there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font>

796
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,590
cleverly that tools but right now it is

797
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,180
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of limited and that's a big</font>

798
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:06,580
negative that allow people don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

799
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">hassle of having to rotate another set</font>

800
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:14,180
of keys any other questions yes one

801
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,509
point chrome has

802
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,940
so yeah I kind of I mentioned Adam

803
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:24,059
Langley and<font color="#CCCCCC"> his talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got a</font>

804
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,190
pretty good post on that about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

805
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,740
why it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and why they took it</font>

806
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:31,920
out but really why boiled down to was no

807
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,709
one was using it you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

808
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,539
fork of chromium that's still supported

809
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,670
basically just took the cone that code

810
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,950
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in chromium forks and none you</font>

811
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,589
can use that but that's that's the

812
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,629
reason why yeah at least that's what

813
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:50,190
Adam Langley says<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why they</font>

814
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:53,069
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out of crown any other questions</font>

815
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,700
I things everybody for coming out i

816
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,700
really appreciate it
