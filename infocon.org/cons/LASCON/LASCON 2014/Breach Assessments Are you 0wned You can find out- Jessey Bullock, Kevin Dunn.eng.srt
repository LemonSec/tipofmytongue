00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,470
welcome to my session my name is Kevin

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,350
Dunn I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a company called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Isaac</font>

3
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,210
partners I love doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> events here in</font>

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,940
Austin where I live<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a sea of</font>

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,220
faces that i know several people in here

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,150
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like talking to a family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,910
always both good and bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess so yes</font>

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,239
welcome to my session breach assessments

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,870
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned you can find out I've been</font>

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security consultant for about 12 years</font>

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,760
I've worked mostly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack and</font>

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,940
penetration side for the majority of

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,699
that recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have been asked to do</font>

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,589
more incident response work over the

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,730
last couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's been a</font>

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,190
pretty interesting transition able to

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,810
see the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the types of things</font>

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,330
that we do on the attack and pen side

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,970
actually happening in enterprises and I

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,940
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you about this idea of</font>

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,590
breach assessment assessing your

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,470
susceptibility and determining whether

23
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,530
you've actually been owned in one way or

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,380
another i came in late to the previous

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,509
presentation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh and Walter I</font>

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,818
think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how they</font>

27
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,619
tackle it in their company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

28
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,800
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some overlap between my what I</font>

29
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,990
have and what they have but the vector

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,509
or the difference here I think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,458
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for any one company I get</font>

32
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,470
brought into lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies to look</font>

33
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,990
at what's happening to them in that kind

34
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,910
of snapshot in time and this is

35
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:54,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely the kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fruits of of</font>

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:56,550
that so originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was myself and</font>

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">another person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my team doing this</font>

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,679
presentation but as in kind of perfect

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,720
timing mode he got called away to do a

40
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:08,098
breach or to investigate a breach so

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,859
it's just me I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid so um which way</font>

42
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,170
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way ok so the subtitle of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,569
presentation are you owned you can find

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,799
out part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is around just making</font>

45
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,619
sure you have some leet speak in your

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,230
presentation title clearly worked

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,590
there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here but the</font>

48
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,799
the kind of undertone to this is you can

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">find out or or can you because the</font>

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,340
challenges around doing this

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,450
as was touched on a little bit in the

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,940
previous talk can be pretty pretty

53
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,649
difficult so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like an</font>

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,260
overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trends that I've seen</font>

55
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,940
and some advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> based upon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

56
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,859
hopefully you'll find it useful so let's

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,980
start at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning so you want to do</font>

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,769
I are who in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here does active incident</font>

59
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,849
response either internally or externally

60
00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:01,530
yeah few people great well let's just

61
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,540
really quickly start off with what

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,410
incident response looks like to most

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,970
people this diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty</font>

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,220
well-known diagram in the incident

65
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,599
response space it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the NIST</font>

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,480
computer security incident handling

67
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:19,140
guide and most people base their

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,869
incident response mechanisms around this

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,059
in some way or an elaborated or expanded

70
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,980
version of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you train with</font>

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,349
people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam's or something and you</font>

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,510
do like their newer courses like 450 a

73
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,858
it's basically based on this but they

74
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,620
have six steps because they've expanded

75
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,180
it so if you're not familiar with

76
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,530
incident response as a broad subject

77
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,180
then you could do a lot worse than

78
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,980
looking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guide then this guide is</font>

79
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:46,260
pretty all-encompassing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and useful these</font>

80
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some examples of ir activities that</font>

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,858
i might get involved with with a company

82
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,750
there you know ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was doing</font>

83
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,980
a broader I<font color="#E5E5E5"> our discussion with you</font>

84
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,299
today I'd probably talk about all of

85
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">these but obviously what we're going to</font>

86
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,169
focus on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea of breach</font>

87
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,690
assessment trying to analyze what's

88
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,970
happened in your environment and work

89
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,880
out you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what actions or</font>

90
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,590
Consequences you need to take but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,849
broader world we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at</font>

92
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,269
this kind of thing developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

93
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:18,120
incident response plan conducting an

94
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,849
incident response readiness review live

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,250
breach assessment so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

96
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,260
something's happening post intrusion

97
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,580
analysis so after the fact trying to

98
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,539
understand what's happened after the

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,698
fact forensics and now we're analysis is

100
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,650
a big part of this process if you do the

101
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,270
full cycle and obviously you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

102
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,239
specialisms and specialists that get

103
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,950
involved in various things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then this</font>

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,740
concept of developing your own sock

105
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,370
security operations center and obviously

106
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the not</font>

107
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,630
everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own sock but</font>

108
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,229
everyone probably likes needs sock like

109
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">activities within their organization so</font>

110
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:58,280
who's developed an incident response

111
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:00,150
plan in this room your hands yep great

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,830
who's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> our instant response</font>

113
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,510
readiness review<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it'd be the</font>

114
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,229
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either do or don't have that</font>

115
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,210
plan testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that plan right it's kind</font>

116
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">of interesting to see what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens right</font>

117
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,510
when you take the fury and try to put it

118
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:18,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> practice but let's start with this</font>

119
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,400
concept of just what is a breach

120
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,940
assessment for the purposes of this this

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,888
discussion this session will will say

122
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,060
that it's an activity that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do in</font>

123
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,710
either a proactive or a reactive way

124
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,000
essentially it's this searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

125
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,000
evidence of current<font color="#E5E5E5"> or previous</font>

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,680
compromise on your enterprise network

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,990
sounds easy right this you know stolen

128
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,180
diagram number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one shows me or number</font>

129
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,680
two shows you that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that</font>

130
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,300
this can either be proactive or reactive

131
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,340
you're either doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to try to</font>

132
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,099
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your capabilities are in</font>

133
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,409
incident response or you're being<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced</font>

134
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:57,150
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack but</font>

135
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,710
really all i wanted to show here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

136
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,030
when all said and done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the dust</font>

137
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,039
settles and hopefully there wasn't too

138
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,409
much dust you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get this kind of</font>

139
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,050
thing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it right you find out how</font>

140
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,610
ready you were for a breach doing it

141
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,650
proactively is obviously better than

142
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,630
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out reactively breach assessment</font>

143
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,039
so within any organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a process</font>

144
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,270
that you'll definitely change you'll

145
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,130
have to adapt right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

146
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,580

147
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,919
what's happening so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

148
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,719
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get hung up too much on what the</font>

149
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,698

<font color="#E5E5E5">might do for a bridge assessment but</font>

151
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,479
it's definitely worth us kind of trying

152
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:41,310
to understand from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level what it</font>

153
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:43,650
is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as a people that work for</font>

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations in a blue team capacity or</font>

and a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk management capacity</font>

156
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,320
or whatever you maybe you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

157
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of idea you need to understand</font>

158
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,940
your external baseline what if things

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,570
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your organization on any</font>

163
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,940
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really recognize when</font>

164
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,889
something's wrong right searching for

165
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,710
anomalous behavior is essentially what a

166
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,870
breach assessment is that's the process

167
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">really working out if a machine is</font>

behaving in a suspicious way or working

out if traffic looks suspicious or looks

170
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:27,060
malicious we look at traffic hitting key

171

the motivations of your threat actors

181
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,568
are going to dictate the kinds of things

you are going to be probably slightly

00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,410
different we may see less now we're

208
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,089
involved in that maybe we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

into the human activity the Hume<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act</font>

and take<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of it anyone from ICS</font>

sector here I mean that's obviously kind

218
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,569
of a big thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we worry about</font>

control of power<font color="#CCCCCC"> plants and substations</font>

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,110
and all that kind of thing but it may be

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,420
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you may be in the</font>

financial sector or any of the other any

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,759
vertical you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of if I can take</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">control of your business process well</font>

225
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,779
it's probably a bad thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,130
because I can influence it I'm not going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to help you by my influence damage is</font>

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that we're most familiar with</font>

from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> angle of hacktivists right d</font>

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,430
dos defacement these types of things we

231
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:01,829
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new kind of or emerging area</font>

of scorched earth or salted earth style

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,449
attacks where things data is deleted

nothing will ever grow here again type

235
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:13,709
ideas so on unfortunately we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

236
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,329
worry about those as well so from a high

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with a couple of slides here that</font>

00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:28,860
again on my best guess at entry points

243
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,099
I've try to cover all of them if I can

244
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,750
but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there are others</font>

malicious websites we all have users in

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,050
our organization that's really the part

251
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,970
of the problem we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really control</font>

what they try to do or rather we can but

down a rabbit hole that was just

basically from a traffic perspective

267
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,610
created because a user was looking at

268

ebay and the images that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were on ebay</font>

269
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,790
was sourced from various countries that

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,530
made it look kinda

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,810
suspicious from a pure traffic analysis

272
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,930

338
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,560
looks like something I couldn't draw

354
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,410
the thing that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be focusing on</font>

355
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,660
if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chase malware situ</font>

data regress all those types of things

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:47,730
this guy is incredibly important sure

358
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,170
everybody everybody gets that so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

359
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,930
will abort if this is the border we have

360
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,120
to also imagine the internal network

361
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like this right faceless brainless</font>

362
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,820
users but actually from an attackers

363
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,380
perspective looks like this right

364
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,270
everything is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what I</font>

365
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,160
want and when I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test this is the</font>

366
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,770
whole point I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

367
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,150
treasure trove whatever the data is

368
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

369
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,079
important data in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your organization</font>

370
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,950
right now right it's not on a DMZ server

371
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,010
right it's on the internal network clear

372
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,210
so all of these angles you know other

373
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,069
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to look at when</font>

374
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:27,500
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breach assessment internal</font>

375
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,670
external traversal everything so

376
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,350
successful breach assessment is

377
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:36,209
essentially telemetry<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus aggregation</font>

378
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:40,020
so telemetry is this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sensors</font>

379
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:42,300
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs AV whatever it might be where</font>

380
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,890
you're getting your raw data from an

381
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,880
aggregation is the idea of bringing it

382
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">all together so that you have a hope</font>

383
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,520
hope of a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figuring out what's</font>

384
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,000
happening in a

385
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:57,090
usable amount of time you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

386
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,770
have sensors without aggregation but you

387
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,990
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately how useful it will it be</font>

388
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,280
too are you able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what's</font>

389
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,990
going on are you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do fret</font>

390
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,959
correlation so this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> about telemetry</font>

391
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,240
though does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it need to be yours or can</font>

392
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,760
it be somebody else's we have seen a

393
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,190
trend of like I are specific firms right

394
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,420
we can all think of big box I<font color="#CCCCCC"> our firms</font>

395
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:24,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist now or maybe one of them and</font>

396
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,800
you know they will have a way of looking

397
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,630
at this where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will bring in their</font>

398
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,979
own equipment equipment and either allow

399
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,980
you to manage it or they'll manage it

400
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,570
for you when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started looking at</font>

401
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,520
breach assessments and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reach</font>

402
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,530
assessments I thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really</font>

403
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,500
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea if all this was just kind of a</font>

404
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,390
money-making idea and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

405
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be way better to do it with your</font>

406
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">own telemetry boy was I wrong it really</font>

407
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,360
depends of course but for a lot of

408
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,000
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fee mere</font>

409
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this they don't</font>

410
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,750
have enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> data gathering going on for</font>

411
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,500
me to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them a reasonable</font>

412
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,490
idea of what's happening sucks but is

413
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,440
true but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we mean by telemetry we</font>

414
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,079
probably need to have quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

415
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">things right I don't know what</font>

416
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,708
organizations you guys are all from but

417
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,870
I would hazard that you have these are

418
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:19,230
the two slides it has to have some of

419
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:21,359
these maybe you have all of them but

420
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:24,209
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of firms I go into to do I</font>

421
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,129
are and breach assessments in they don't

422
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,440
have many of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> points so it's like</font>

423
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:32,430
mm-hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to do</font>

424
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,350
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> content filtering tracing</font>

425
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,420
website and domain access basically as

426
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,340
it leaves your organization products

427
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,370
like websense<font color="#CCCCCC"> barracuda there are tons</font>

428
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,629
right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that users get</font>

429
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,550
annoyed at when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to go to</font>

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook and it says well yeah you can't</font>

432
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,160
you know it's obviously also blocking a

lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you can define</font>

important<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping that list up to date</font>

well when you're defending the network

dns server logs these are pretty

440
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,730
important as well and really

on your relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your ISP or</font>

work however they can also be the early

encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers to do that as</font>

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,310
for you right hopefully not but when it

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,900
comes to breach assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,050
important ideas about what's happening

482
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,880
or what may have happened if you're like

483
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,680
you know 99% of everybody else in the

484
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,500
world then your internal enterprise is

485
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,390
managed by Microsoft Active Directory

486
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,440
yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know you have that's Bill</font>

488
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,820
know I know you have other operating

490
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,149
you have linux you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX you have</font>

491
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,790
dusty stuff that you can't walk next to

492
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,220
you because it's so flaky but most of

493
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,930
the administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> and management in</font>

494
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,720
most environments that we walk into nay

495
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,550
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are ad so tracing events in</font>

496
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,920
active directory is pretty important if

497
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,600
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see some potential malicious</font>

498
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,610
malicious activity

499
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,559
however it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just about ad right I</font>

500
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,059
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trace it at a local host level I</font>

501
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,860
need to understand what's happening on

502
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,620
member servers or workstations that

503
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,280
aren't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't the side that doesn't</font>

504
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,010
represent an action in ad it's locally

505
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,139
why well because you know pen test and

506
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,210
hacking activity may not be affecting ad

507
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,950
initially it may be affecting the local

508
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,640
machine in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can't creation</font>

509
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,980
for example I can't do this work without

510
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,720
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at traffic for anomalies now</font>

511
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,429
there are lots of ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

512
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,250
traffic there's lots in terms of like

513
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,990
what domains is the traffic going to and

514
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,340
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocol is it but at some</font>

515
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,190
point when you get down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weeds</font>

516
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,959
of trying to analyze a breach you have

517
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,850
to have dpi right you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

518
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual deep packet inspection and</font>

519
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,709
see what the request was what the

520
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,200
response was is encrypted is it funky

521
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,330
you know all these types of things the

522
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,600
last area that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost can't avoid</font>

523
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:15,539
now is forensic capture acquisition of

524
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">the drives or memory capture for hosts</font>

525
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,320
that you think have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> infected or</font>

526
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,850
have been touched in some way this is an

527
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,610
area that you may or may not do

528
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,559
internally but you probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

529
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,240
this if you're determined about finding

530
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,270
out what the malware was and what it was

531
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,530
doing you may not be you may have

532
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,650
figured out that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a very</font>

533
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,480
well-known variant of something and you

534
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,350
just clean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on it life's too</font>

535
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,380
short it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a well-known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> variant</font>

536
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it may have been a targeted piece of</font>

537
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,000
malware that was written<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for you</font>

538
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,189
you probably want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

539
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,140
some examples content filtering like I

540
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,419
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example of some</font>

541
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,539
screenshots from web sensor it's not the

542
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:00,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one out there you can see here that</font>

543
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,789
it categorizes things very nicely what I

544
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like about a lot of these products</font>

545
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">though and another theme that runs</font>

546
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,459
through this is the ability to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

547
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,610
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and get data out of it in a</font>

548
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,890
fast way now like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have</font>

549
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,719
the luxury of doing this for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

550
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,730
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own company so I don't have</font>

551
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,830
influence on purchasing power or

552
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,419
anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I have to go into</font>

553
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:25,939
firms and really make do with what

554
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:28,140
they've got boy that's tough

555
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,640
because obviously you have customers

556
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,550
that have a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have customers</font>

557
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,110
have a little but they both examples of

558
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,149
those customers both expect the same

559
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,830
thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to tell them what on</font>

560
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:43,020
earth's happened dns this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

provide fret intelligence on malware

564

591
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,090
cool if you scan your workstations and

592
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,470
you see all these vulnerabilities then

593
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,270
you get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> indication of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the types of</font>

malware that use those vulnerabilities

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,770
and therefore when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to</font>

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at a workstation that's doing</font>

597
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,970
something crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you correlate this</font>

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,650
stuff together<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see how this may</font>

599
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,530
be because they're not patched against

600
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,980
such and such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java bug or Adobe or</font>

601
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,930
whatever it might be this is only useful

602
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,600
though if you scan your workstations a

603
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,490
lot of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with they do</font>

604
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,939
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> great enterprise scanning platforms</font>

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,370
in place like Nessus or or an expose but

606
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,830
they scan their servers only that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

607
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,989
great from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective of a breach</font>

608
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,429
assessment because most malware that

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at and tracing is not</font>

610
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:37,940
happening on servers hopefully it's

611
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,940
happening more on workstations

612
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,090
so active directory events these are

613
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:46,910
fantastic who uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk in their</font>

614
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,730
organization excellent I don't see any

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:52,700
t-shirts though it's usually t-shirts in

616
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">the organ so splunk is pretty cool but</font>

617
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,420
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just an example of us</font>

618
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,419
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to look into what's happening</font>

00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,520
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad and I've got some other examples</font>

620
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,510
in a bit about the types of things that

621
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,040
we do with this but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> powerful</font>

623
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,230
examples so remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about this</font>

624
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:15,790
idea of host access anomalies trying to

625
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,919
trace activity that is actually

626
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,480
malicious now obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> this varies</font>

627
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,760
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what kind of activity</font>

628
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,950
you're tracing if it's if it's malware

629
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,010
we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at beaconing if it's</font>

630

huemac if its actual hackers or pen

631
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,929
testers or whatever then we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

632
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,820
look for a behavioral analysis and

633
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,470
anomaly detection based upon what

634
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,530
systems are accessing what and what

635
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,419
they're asking to do analyzing ad is

636
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,889
really is really cool for that what I

637
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:44,510
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an example of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just running</font>

640
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,260
was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the use of a</font>

absolutely not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just say you</font>

645
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,980
did it's quite important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

646
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,250
understand where those are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

647
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,230
from why well because hopefully normal

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:11,960
analysis and normal patterns of usage

649
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:15,140
for that account are quite predictable

650
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,299
what hosts are accessing using that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

651
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,429
what I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is an example of</font>

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,770
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it stand out like a</font>

it's nothing none absolutely nothing at

00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:33,769
all I would suggest you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

682
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:36,199
if you can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect that because we</font>

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,029
know good old-fashioned forensic capture

716
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:51,769
and analysis is a good way to do it if

717
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,749
you're in a virtual environment then

718
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:55,399
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's way easier but if you're</font>

719
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you're in a traditional kind of disk</font>

720
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:01,299
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> then break out the right</font>

721
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,780
blockers it's Christmas

722
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:07,960
so great telemetry great aggregation

723
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,040
great what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we actually looking for</font>

724
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,490
well here's some examples and I've

725
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,290
talked about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them already</font>

726
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:19,190
malware see to write bi-directional<font color="#E5E5E5"> c2</font>

727
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:21,350
we want to see evidence of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

728
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,090
are being communicated and controlled by

729
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,010
people outside of your organization I

730
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:26,629
mean we don't want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

731
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,360
that's what the breach assessment will

732
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,190
probably show traditional reverse shells

733
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,309
maybe maybe we'll see some stuff being

734
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,780
pushed out interestingly now we're

735
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:38,500
obviously also looking at trying to

736
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,660
inspect their traffic that sometimes

737
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,340
potentially legitimate so you know when

738
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,590
I do pen tests we often write like

739
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,899
custom malware and see to that that does

740
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,370
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> c2 over Twitter or github or any of</font>

741
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,290
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> feature rich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> websites that you</font>

742
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:54,820
probably do allow your your users to

743
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,960
access so depending if we have any

744
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,580
indication that something particularly

745
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,140
sneaky is going on then maybe we have to

746
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,570
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of access as well as</font>

747
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,049
the blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah that are you stuff</font>

748
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will see in the logs access and</font>

749
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:10,340
destruction yeah this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

750
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,679
important so wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you keep your key</font>

751
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,299
data your most important data I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

752
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,549
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the logs on who's accessed that</font>

753
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:18,320
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about data</font>

754
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,970
egress at this point it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

755
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,770
which users in your organization have

756
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,480
accessed the database with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the powerful</font>

757
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:28,220
data in so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good area to look</font>

758
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,480
encrypted protocols yes and no most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

759
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,030
the tunneling was seeing is just over

760
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,230
SSL most of the time so but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw</font>

761
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,910
something non-standard that would

762
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,910
probably be pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

763
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,380
indicator of something significant

764
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:41,299
obviously we are still looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

765
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,010
old kind of stuff of like evidence of

766
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:44,450
application attacks so if you have

767
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,520
logging on your web servers and your

768
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,350
database servers we're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

769
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,879
are we seeing an injection vulnerability

770
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:53,000
being exploited these types of things

771
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,100
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know anything against</font>

772
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,630
internal servers or servers in general

773
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,730
this really comes down to whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

774
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:03,020
have the capability in your organization

775
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:06,400
to show me scanning activity or not what

776
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,450
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like well yeah ultimately</font>

777
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,730
it could look like a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things but</font>

778
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically human activity looks different</font>

779
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,470
to malware in my experience so you can

780
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,510
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

781
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:19,049
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of pattern to actually</font>

782
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,640
follow one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things here I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

783
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,080
Josh mentioned it before as well as

784
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,659
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIF collective intelligence</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">experience of this so far is that the</font>

788
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,110

789
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you I don't know if anybody uses it here</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP and domain information you</font>

791
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,399
get firstly you just get like domain

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in date from the perspective of</font>

794
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,669
like eighty-five percent of what you see

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip that your correlate to that your</font>

for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular organization will be</font>

798
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,299
like pointing to things like AWS ec2 or

799
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:59,190
this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff right obviously those</font>

800
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:01,168
IPS and those domains have been you know

801
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,570
recycled about five hundred times before

802
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,460
I actually went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> siff and at</font>

805
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,959
says it's bad forever this is a tough

806
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:14,940
problem I don't know of particularly

807
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">great threat intelligence feeds at the</font>

808
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,390

think are good it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tough but it</font>

811
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,610
will still work especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you see a</font>

812
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,710
lot of browsing activity or traffic

813
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:31,709
activity from a single host and they are

814
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,720
they are on SIF in multiple places but

815
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,309
I'm you know ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying like just</font>

816
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

817
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:39,450
indicator of definite compromise because

818
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,159
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be raising a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of alarms for a</font>

819
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:46,530
lot of false positives in my personal

820
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:49,590
experience so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from a high</font>

821
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:51,149
level case study of typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,270
will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> for something that looks like</font>

823
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,940

<font color="#E5E5E5">unquote odd destinations this is about</font>

826
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,320
destinations odd though right you have

827
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,940
to obviously kind of have an

828
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,980
understanding first and foremost of your

829
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,350
organization's baseline traffic and what

830
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are doing legitimately and then</font>

831
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,370
you can correlate against threat

832
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,799
intelligence feeds as well and then

833
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,090
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things like country</font>

834
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,320
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other things but really</font>

835
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:22,199
you know that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you have</font>

836
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,000
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go deeper polling</font>

837
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,770
or beaconing of traffic absolutely if

838
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,360
it's traced back to work stations this

839
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a generally like in</font>

840
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,320
of one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it's an indication</font>

841
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,719
of malware or it's an indication of a

842
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,149
user with bad browsing habits which one

843
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,860
do you think comes up more it's usually

844
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the user that's browsing to stuff</font>

845
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to browse to and</font>

846
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:44,610
it's not great you know or it's linking

847
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:46,950
to content that's not great the ebay

848
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,649
example comes up a lot you know images

849
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">are being sourced from other areas that</font>

850
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:55,710
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a kind of TLD perspective or</font>

851
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:58,049
traffic expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

852
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,520
ultimately can't get away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this idea</font>

853
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:01,799
though if you get enough indications of

854
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,660
potential compromise you have to get

855
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,150
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dpi you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

856
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,639
traffic was because a lot of times the

857
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,918

<font color="#CCCCCC">as like an obstacle request or something</font>

859
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,368
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can kind of reach</font>

860
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,440
out to intelligence feeds like

before if you have a product like fire I

865
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,419
it does quite a bit of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you but</font>

are non-standard if you have a standard

naming convention for your host names of

884
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,500
in your organization that's not you know

885
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,970
we don't suggest a standard naming

886
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,790
convention for host name is just because

887
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,109
it's annoying we suggest it because it

888
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,840
then allows you to see stuff that

889
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,460
doesn't have it and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> onto site</font>

00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,050
named in a very like deliberate way

893
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,279
either with our company name in it or

<font color="#E5E5E5">hacker or something like that because</font>

895
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,790
ultimately I want blue team members to

00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,560
bust<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the door and ask me what's</font>

almost never happens in my entire career

has only happened once and they call the

902
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:51,808
police that was a communications mistake

903
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:53,400
and a language barrier I think you

shouldn't have the main admins being

would tell us all about you know which

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at odd locations right you</font>

932
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,700
good indicator of compromise if

933
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:59,430
something's happening you should be able

934
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,019
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it based on location shares map</font>

935
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,339
to domain controllers that's a good one

936
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,549
that's probably me stealing your Sam

database or something like that right

938
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:08,249
gratuitous use of PowerShell i would

939
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,900
suggest that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attacker not an admin</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell the</font>

most to properly pen testers or

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:18,269
attackers and hopefully it will also<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:20,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">sis admins more and more so I'm pretty</font>

944
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:23,098
straightforward right well obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

945
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:26,700
why I'm running out of time so 99

946
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:28,349
problems yeah tons of problems and this

947
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,269
is why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate that I can't just</font>

948
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:33,559
say to you do all of this thank you

949

<font color="#CCCCCC">goodnight is tough cost is a huge thing</font>

950
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,950
I was making suggestions to the types of

951
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:39,660
things that particular client recently

952
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,729
should be logging in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there splunk</font>

953
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,769
instance and they paused and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

954
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it may be cheaper for us to</font>

955
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:50,549
purchase<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk as a company then then</font>

956
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:53,609
do what you're suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Splunk</font>

00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:56,160
fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> by splint however</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BB</font>

958
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:58,440
cognizant of the fact that their

959
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,390
licensing model currently means that it

960
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,549
can be very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to log down and</font>

961
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,019
correlate things like create process or

00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:06,180
something because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data you</font>

00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:20,430
find blue teams that are set up around

just looking at logs and just looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,180
trouble tickets as they come up but

without the concept of understanding

972
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,220
fret correlation what this Plus this

973
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:31,289
Plus this probably means that's a

974
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,609
knowledge gap thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately and it</font>

975
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,200
kind of needs somebody from the red team

976
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:36,839
side and some of them or someone that's

977

trained in<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks to be able to piece a</font>

978
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,549
lot of that stuff together which I

00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:43,349
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be the blue team's job</font>

00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:46,829
you should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that know about</font>

fret correlation data accessibility and

00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:51,390
data aggregation accessibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real</font>

983
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,819
pain I end up having to write a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

984
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,549
Python on the fly to interface with the

985
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:58,589
api's of telemetry products because if

986
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:01,288
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an API if there isn't an API</font>

987
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:03,269
and like it's literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can only</font>

988
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:08,220
export via a GUI to an Excel spreadsheet

989
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:09,779
I mean a like a really big problem the

990
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,339
number that was being said recently in

991
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,230
the last talk was like a billion flow as

992
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,690
a day or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that right try</font>

993
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:17,160
doing that with an Excel spreadsheet

994
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,989
exporting all of that data so when

995
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,149
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> picking your products you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

996
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:23,369
have an eye on that like how extensible

997
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,410
is it how interoperable is it does it

998
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:27,119
have an API that is fully fledged so

999
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,089
that you can get this data out for

1000
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,989
analysis when we go into firms it ranges

1001
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:35,999

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem the speed of which i</font>

1003
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,149
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data item analysis</font>

1004
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:41,099
analyze it in a post compromised

situation may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as fast as in a</font>

1006
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,440
live compromised situation it really

1007
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:48,269
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's happening I cloud for</font>

1008
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,670
anyone who's playing bingo yeah clouds a

1009
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:52,049
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> wise quite a problem well if</font>

1010
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,749
you're like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of companies and your</font>

1011
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:58,049
offsetting quite a bit of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

1012
00:39:53,749 --> 00:40:00,419
company into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud then good luck</font>

1013
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting those logs sometimes I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1014
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,829
going to say that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely always</font>

1015
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,660
but sometimes and good<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck getting</font>

1016
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disk images right</font>

1017
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,399
so when you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> csps and</font>

1018
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:15,000
you've got one<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IR find out if</font>

1019
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,970
they let you get that data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

1020
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI this is an example</font>

1021
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:24,209
of the log stash<font color="#E5E5E5"> cabana get GUI or or is</font>

1022
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,560
it I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they look pretty similar</font>

1023
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,720
right one is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is free one is not free</font>

1024
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,340
so if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into this but</font>

1025
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,140
you have budget constraints and you

1026
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,330
think that some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1027
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,160
too high in a bar for you then take a

1028
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:41,009
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the like the Alaska search stuff</font>

1029
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,899
right log stash is just phenomenal it

1030
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,240
can do in my experience so far it and do

1031
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,800
a lot of the things that's plunks doing

1032
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,970
but with no support right so you better

1033
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,880
be ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to roll up your sleeves so is</font>

1034
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it worth it yeah it's definitely worth</font>

1035
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,320
doing briefly for each assessment right

1036
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,440
you will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> breeches but you will also</font>

1037
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,820
find a heck of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> false positives</font>

1038
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,560
and then the main thing that you'll find

1039
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">out when you do a breach assessment is</font>

1040
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,020
your gaps what data did you not have

1041
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,390
false positives are an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing</font>

1042
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,950
sheep in wolves clothing remember this

1043
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,569
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> from before that was making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1044
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,160
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> beaconing requests out to all</font>

1045
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:18,660
these foreign countries that made us all

1046
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,990
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were doing the assessment were</font>

1047
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,940
like got it this is the one no it was an

1048
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:26,160
RSA envision server it was a security

1049
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,680
product security products often look

1050
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,240
like malicious products right so the RSA

1051
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">envisioned server was analyzing a</font>

1052
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,870
company's firewall probes for all the

1053
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,790
stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was being dropped</font>

1054
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,740
successfully at the border and then was

1055
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:41,490
doing reverse lookups<font color="#E5E5E5"> row stresses</font>

1056
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,319
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a beacon acoso</font>

1057
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,779
um you know one of the things that

1058
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,310
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find here is everything looks</font>

1059
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:52,440
like a breach when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

1060
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:54,240
breaches right the gaps this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1061
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,530
the big one a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1062
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,819
audience I suspect that are thinking

1063
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">about their organization will be</font>

1064
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,140
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do and don't</font>

1065
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">have so if i come and you've asked me to</font>

1066
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,650
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ir gig and do a breach</font>

1067
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,419
assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to be saying okay</font>

1068
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,940
where's the data what's what data do I

1069
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,140
have I'm not cutting fiber and looking

1070
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a light right i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to actually</font>

1071
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,259
see that would work her tuna does our

1072
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,090
example i need to actually see the data

1073
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:23,430
so think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1074
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:26,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">really absolutely make sure that this</font>

1075
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:30,690
works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you consider the compromises</font>

1076
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:34,050
and consider the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fret actors so wrapping</font>

1077
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:35,460
up what's next you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> design a</font>

1078
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,900
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will find real attacks</font>

1079
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,880
figure out what the attacks are for your

1080
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,500
organization they'll be pretty standard

1081
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,830
in some cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> specialist in others</font>

1082
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,860
and design your telemetry and your IR

1083
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:49,740
system if you will around that you

1084
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:52,740
ultimately need to test it proactively

1085
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,600
within your organization this slide

1086
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,990
always comes out really weird test it

1087
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,549
soft really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard but the point is you</font>

1088
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,319
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test it within your organization</font>

1089
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:02,880
to make sure it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you need</font>

1090
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get somebody else outside of your</font>

1091
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,180
organization to test it that's not me up

1092
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,640
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's me being real it</font>

1093
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,230
realistic have somebody put your blue

1094
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,029
team in their sensor system through its

1095
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:16,080
paces it's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you're going to</font>

1096
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out if it works one of my</font>

1097
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,880
final quotes to haunt everybody is does

1098
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:23,640
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye our plan meet your dr plan at</font>

1099
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,830
some point your breach may be so bad

1100
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to enact dr like</font>

1101
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,240
procedures we're all used to dr we're

1102
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,890
all used to the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a flash flood</font>

1103
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,770
comes through our data center we switch

1104
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,629
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other five that we've got</font>

1105
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,280
but is anyone making that process and

1106
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,980
policy decision in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization to</font>

1107
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,790
have that kind of response to a to a

1108
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,410
breach to an attack when you know if you

1109
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,000
want to case study stuff that went for

1110
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:50,310
when it really goes bad you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1111
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,410
at like saudi aramco and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shamu right</font>

1112
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">30,000 workstation hard drives replace</font>

1113
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:59,879
you all guys have plans for that right

1114
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,220
so lastly of course when's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best time</font>

1115
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,280
to find out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were not ready for</font>

1116
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,589
ir when you've proactively testing it

1117
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,360
not during a life breach right companies

1118
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,440
do this pre up proactively and they

1119
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,090
bring us in to help them with that

1120
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,230
sometimes and they bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> us into drill</font>

1121
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:15,510
it there are people doing this

1122
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,190
proactively but it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same</font>

1123
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,600
category of the number of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1124
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:23,510
are using honey pots right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>
