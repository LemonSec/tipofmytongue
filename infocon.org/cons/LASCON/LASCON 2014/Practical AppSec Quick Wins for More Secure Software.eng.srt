00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,189
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to talk about some quick</font>

2
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:25,810
wins or more secure software this is

3
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:28,419
probably like the least technical talk

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,859
I've ever really done it's kind of I've

5
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:33,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">been at my company for about a year</font>

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:35,860
saber and I've kind of been introduced

7
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:39,190
to the enterprise IT security world and

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,790
how to how they kind of clash with

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,470
development so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to be a developer</font>

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,000
but now that I'm an IT security I

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,559
actually see kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> friction that</font>

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
happened so i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about some</font>

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,769
maybe some easy things some quick wins

demonstrate the return on investment to

78
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:17,250
the executives and in just in general EU

that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

thing in terms of the maturity level

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,970
it's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't happen overnight it's a</font>

84
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,520
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just took a few sample</font>

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,090
charts from various maturity models and

86
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and other marketing information about</font>

87
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,710
how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start off with kind of an ad hoc</font>

88
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,000
approach and ultimately on the most

89
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,130
mature level you've got everything

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">working smoothly your you have an</font>

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,850
optimized program and everything's

92
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,340
working nicely however you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

93
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the advantages that that you need</font>

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:06,479
in terms of budget resources time to do

95
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,460
such a great job so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,950
about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complications that I</font>

97
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,229
mean I've seen and I know other

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,599
organizations around the world are

99
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,530
seeing as well first of all you may not

100
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,020
have a mandate from executives a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

101
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,940
times well I would say most<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the</font>

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,250
grassroots approach to application

103
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,830
security where maybe the IT security

104
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,350
team or some developers decide they're

105
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,789
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a program going and they're</font>

106
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a grassroots effort to get</font>

107
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going not necessarily going to work</font>

108
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,650
because the the development side is

109
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,820
there not being graded on the security

110
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,349
of their applications they're going to

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,230
you know grade it on the performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

112
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,340
it done on time does it work

113
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,560
if there's no mandate from their

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,419
management to include security<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,340
why would they listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people or</font>

116
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,110
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT security guys saying that they</font>

117
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,260
want to improve the security of the

118
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,690
software there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of applications</font>

119
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,700
and your organization many websites web

123
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,530

125
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,419
security team that's kind of why I ended

126
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">up there however</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to be honest I'm</font>

127
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,630
feeling a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit overwhelmed right</font>

128
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,849
now because we're a huge software

129
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,760
technology company we write a lot of

130
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,760
code and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm looking for</font>

131
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,800
ways to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difference right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

132
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,140
I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and individual teams that I work</font>

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,540
with but in a company-wide feel like I

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:48,210
need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff and more expertise in</font>

135
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:50,790
application security in terms of mixing

136
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,549
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the development teams like I said</font>

137
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">without the development side having a</font>

138
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,320
mandate to include security a lot of

139
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,369
times you'll get resistance to

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,500
suggestions how they might improve their

141
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,150
processes or improve their security of

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,160
their code or heaven forbid you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

143
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:10,650
vulnerabilities in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you tell</font>

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:16,500
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some general</font>

201
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,260
the pro version is only two hundred

we use other tools for web apps scanning

tool that I use we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font>

209
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,170

210
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:18,300
scanner part you know what's an

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,399
interesting URL it's a URL with a query

212

there's a lot of parameters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the body</font>

anywhere where that information was kept

235
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,199
I've had bits and pieces and drawed it

236
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,100

<font color="#E5E5E5">your external facing web presence</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">one of the things that is really easy to</font>

247
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,170
times when I've found applications that

00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:04,049
are still<font color="#CCCCCC"> running there's newer versions</font>

250
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,259
older version is still running because

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">there might be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or two customers</font>

252
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,499
using it and the business well we can't

turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off we still have a couple</font>

255
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well okay let's talk to the</font>

256
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">business and the team about the</font>

advantages of reducing your surf attack

surface

259
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,760
because then you don't even need to test

260
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,550
that out you can just make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away</font>

261
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,950
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful consolidate consolidating</font>

262
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,589
duplicate apps turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> off functionality</font>

263
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,960
that's not needed there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of times</font>

264
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:38,000
I've talked two teams and I've asked

265
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,710
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what is this part of era do oh</font>

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we don't use that anymore but</font>

267
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,180
it's still there and it's still running

268
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,209
so you know remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from the build</font>

269
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,229
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have that code even</font>

270
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:54,110
visible anymore and superfluous content

271
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:59,120
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily functionality</font>

272
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:02,450
but its its documentation static files

273
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,370
that have made their way onto a web

274
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,470
server and it's externally facing and

275
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,880
it's potentially information disclosure

276
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:13,070
type of type of an issue so how do you

277
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,530
find your attack surface well of course

discovery service let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

288
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,920
google hacking on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure everyone</font>

289
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows this but the advanced search</font>

290
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,540
operators can really help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i happen</font>

291
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not long after target</font>

292
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,579
on got breached well this was probably

293
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:52,220
like this past summer I decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

294
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,960
target got breached you know they've

295
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,630
probably really locked things down at

296
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,640
this point so I just went to Google I

297
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,590
wanted to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of web</font>

298
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,470
content is out there facing the internet

299
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,120
so i did site colon target com and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font>

300
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">a list one of the ones that look</font>

301
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,050
interesting to me was this coupons the

302
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,240
third one down so i decided to kind of

303
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,060
refine my google hacking searched and I

304
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,420
searched for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word login and only the</font>

305
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,420
coupons at target.com host and very

306
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,800
quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found an interesting what this</font>

307
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,579
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to me this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where I</font>

308
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,589
stopped but i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cold fusion site</font>

309
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,830
cold fusion site that has a

310
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:35,589
authentication and it's some sort of

311
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,610
administrator related

312
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,990
functionality because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found all those</font>

313
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:44,180
words are there I don't know if that's

314
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,600
vulnerable not but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

315
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,779
thing that you can do to find content at

316
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,220
your organization by the way is everyone

317
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:55,580
know that there are actually cold fusion

318
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,890
conferences still happening they

319
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,720
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in fact I was in last Las</font>

320
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,699
Vegas last week and I happen to be right

321
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,880
next to one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a screenshot here</font>

322
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:11,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took a screenshot of the agenda and</font>

323
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,490
one of the items at 130pm was don't

324
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,709
throw out don't throw that out bringing

325
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,860
legacy it showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> up bringing legacy cold</font>

326
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:21,260
fusion code into this century so there

327
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:26,860
are still active developers out there in

328
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,860
coldfusion that was a surprise to me

329
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,410
it's had its problem in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

330
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> derp buster um has anyone ever</font>

331
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,219
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> door buster okay some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

332
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,779
really easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there's</font>

333
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing like complex about it it</font>

334
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:44,660
basically has a huge file list of common

335
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,750
directory and file names you fire it up

336
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,209
it's a java application java desktop

337
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,470
application you fire it up you point it

338
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:56,479
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL the target site and it's</font>

339
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a file and directory brute</font>

340
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,060
forcer and so you can specify here the

341
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,300
if you want to brute force files as well

342
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,449
as directories you can specify a file

343
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,010
extension you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell it if you want to</font>

344
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,260
be recursive or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if it finds a</font>

345
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,910
directory it'll start searching sub

346
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,100
directories under there so basically

347
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,910
you're just looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for content that</font>

348
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe have interesting or possibly</font>

349
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,020
vulnerable functionality or anything

350
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe not supposed to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's</font>

351
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,240
amazingly adept at finding content that

352
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,029
maybe you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find manually by</font>

353
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,730
guessing a lot of it has to do with the

354
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,380
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> list that they come with with der</font>

355
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,180
buster I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of refined it over</font>

356
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,709
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've added to it I've taken some</font>

357
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,839
stuff away like the file list actually

358
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,489
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like I kind of porn</font>

359
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,400
related words that I don't even want to

360
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,089
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for so I remove all those I add a</font>

361
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,490
bunch of others that I'm

362
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:52,709
that I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're often out there</font>

363
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,829
and now I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that over the years so</font>

364
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:57,300
I have a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good list right now that</font>

365
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,739
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should put on my blog</font>

366
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,649
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something sometime other people might</font>

367
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">find it useful but you just fire fire</font>

368
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:06,329
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buster and it goes and it</font>

369
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:10,470
gives you a nice tree directory listing

370
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:12,658
of everything it finds so that was quick

371
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,480
win number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it was reduce</font>

372
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:20,819
your attack surface quick win number to

373
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,339
shore up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl configuration now I</font>

374
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,438
put hardly on here only because there's

375
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,418
actually in brand new version of openssl

376
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,809
about came out about a week ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

377
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:33,990
point 0 point 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> J I'm not exactly sure</font>

378
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:36,000
what security fixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

379
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,710
know that it mentions there are some in

380
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this version so I thought it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

381
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,960
good to just make make mention of that

382
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:50,580
obviously anything built anything before

383
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:54,870
one point 01<font color="#CCCCCC"> f is bad also testing your</font>

384
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSL configuration is really easy to do</font>

385
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:02,279
there's not there's several options here

386
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:05,190
a long time ago I use th see SSL check

387

freak it's pearl<font color="#CCCCCC"> command-line tool you</font>

401
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,140
can grab it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this URL and you fire it</font>

402
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,820
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has all kinds of interesting</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your SSL configuration</font>

404
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,110
it's it's almost overwhelming actually

405
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,889
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can really geeked out with any</font>

406
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:03,080
information that it provides the qualys

407

<font color="#CCCCCC">SSL test is at that URL there</font>

408
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,049
three quick and easy nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> report really</font>

409
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,129
nice report you can print out and send

410
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:12,629
to someone that's to explain the problem

411
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:14,519
you know it'll check for things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font>

412
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:17,370
v2 and heart bleed and poodle and all

413
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,129
these other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing is</font>

414
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:24,330
if you do put in your host here you're

415
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:26,580
the site you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i always like</font>

416
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">to check the checkbox that says do not</font>

417
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,299
show the results on the boards otherwise

418
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,919
you get result everyone goes to this

419
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,918
page can see the results of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your skin</font>

420
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,210
yeah i'm not sure why that's not checked

421
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:41,879
by default maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> qualis wants to just</font>

422
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,889
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> available to everyone but even</font>

423

said you know these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most recent</font>

425
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably somebody screen scraping this</font>

426
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:55,490
like every hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and collecting all that</font>

427
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,809
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real simple one is uh you</font>

Firefox developer extension is a quick

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,240
way to check if it's mark secure or not

434
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,519
and HTTP only it shows you both of those

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:26,220
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do view cookies alright so that</font>

your SSL configuration number three is

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,939
quashed the number one battie which is

439

sequel injection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to gym</font>

444
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,820
easy to fix um if developers do this one

445
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,980
thing which is use parameterize queries

446
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,408
then all the problems with sequel

447
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,879
injection go away if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

448
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,590
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have sequel injection so</font>

449
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:59,699
it's very black and white it's not

450
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,590
difficult to fix but you know if your

451
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,259
organization has a lot of code that's

452
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,120
been written over the years it's

453
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:08,970
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if you might have</font>

454
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,729
sequel injection in that code and so you

455
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,909
need to test for it how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

456
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,360
it on kind of a you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know budget if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font>

458
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,139
budget-conscious and don't have you

459
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,970
can't pay pen testers and you can't buy

460
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,110
the top of line tools or whatever well

461
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,270
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different ways you can</font>

462
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,879
grab this firefox extension called

463
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,520
sequel inject me that will test an

464
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,190
individual page or a form you can

465
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,200
download this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parker or community</font>

466
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,210
if anyone use nets marker it's a

467
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,850
scanning tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> i may have not heard about</font>

468
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:43,020
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's you know similar to web</font>

469
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,290
inspect apps can but there's a community

470
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,059
edition and it actually does full checks

471
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:51,418
for cross-site scripting and sequel

472
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,750
injection so you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good way</font>

473
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:57,390

it to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate there's</font>

478
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,149
like you can't generate a report on like

479
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,399
a PDF report so it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's</font>

480
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,480
it's been a handicapped on purpose but

481
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you find sequel injection</font>

482
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,530
obviously the unauthenticated surface

area is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your number one priority so if</font>

that stuff this from the unauthenticated

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,679
attacks so it doesn't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

495
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,000
just look at sequel errors that come

496
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:55,230
back in the response to know if they're

497
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,790
sequel injection there a little bit more

498
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:03,049
advanced than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so like I</font>

499
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:06,600
said developers do have the power here

500
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:11,190
the sequel injection cheat cheat sheet

501
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,780
on a wasp is very good I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

502
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for if you're if you're talking</font>

503

<font color="#E5E5E5">to a development team and they don't</font>

504
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,399
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font>

505
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have some guidance on how to fix it</font>

506
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,130
this is some information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can give</font>

507
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,169
them video nice of you video tutorial

00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:27,620
Jerry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hoff did that and it's only ten</font>

509
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:27,620
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

510
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four quash unauthenticated</font>

511
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,640
XSS so again i'm looking here at

512
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,900
cross-site scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure it's</font>

513
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,760
fixed from an unauthenticated

514
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,010
perspective those were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

515
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,500
an order of magnitude worse because

516
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,059
they're perfect for fishing and so

517
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,860
getting that fixed from the

518
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,908
unauthenticated point of view is

519
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,199
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ross's app now I haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

520
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,840
apple off but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really good things</font>

521
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it so have you guys used it yeah</font>

522
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,280
so um I notice how it's a lot of

523
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,630
advancements lately I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was a</font>

524
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:13,350
fork from<font color="#CCCCCC"> perros back in the day which i</font>

525
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:17,070
used long time ago but it has a free

526
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,959
scanner for XSS and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nets Parker</font>

527
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,320
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned also can test for XSS</font>

528
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,260
and the pro version the pro version of

529
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:30,418
its scanner is very good at testing for

530
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:33,360
XSS so fixing is not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> as simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

531
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,679
sequel injection unfortunately encoding

532
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,928
is really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

533
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,429
where Jim manic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh is really good at</font>

534
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:42,120
explaining the types of encoding that

535
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:46,740
you need to do and blacklisting is a big

536
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,580
no-no I know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one of our teams</font>

537
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,980
start we're fixing some a lot of the

538
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:56,520
event handlers like onmouseover and on

539
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,900
click and all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

540
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,270
some issues with cross-site scripting

541
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:05,400
there and so uh unfortunately a

542
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:07,799
blacklist was being used and I mean

543
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,140
there's probably three dozen different

544
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,720
mouse events that can fire in various

545
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,409
browsers and it was like chit you know

546
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to chase chase your tail trying</font>

547
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:22,650
to get every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance of the</font>

548
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,929
mouse events to to return an air on if

549
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,059
you see it in the request so obviously

550
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:29,940
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data is much much better</font>

551
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:34,080
approach also content security policy

552
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:37,049
it's an HTTP response header that every

553
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,800
web application can set and tells the

554
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,050
browsers that only<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript code</font>

555
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:48,419
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular site is going to be</font>

558
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:58,050
content security policy in about an hour

559
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,120
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually at one I think and there's a</font>

560
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">video tutorial on cross-site scripting</font>

561
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,429
inner as well so I in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome as you</font>

562
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,720
probably know have some built-in

563
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,910
protection against cross-site scripting

564
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,220
on because one of the things that's

565
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,570
important is to demonstrate to the

566
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,610
developers or whoever is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

568
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:19,679
what you can do demonstrate to them how

569
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,300
to problem so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually it's important to</font>

570
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,350
use firefox with that unless they turn

571
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:28,649
off the the filters the xss fit I think

572
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:31,320
IE it's called XSS filter chrome<font color="#CCCCCC"> chrome</font>

573
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,430
it's called XSS auditor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox doesn't</font>

574
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,750
really have anything built in a lot of

575
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">people use no script its accomplishment</font>

576
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,940
to demonstrate cross-site scripting as

577
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,680
possible and make it impactful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

578
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,690
so they see look this is bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

579
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,030
could do this now historically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

580
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,390
been done with the alert pop-up box

581
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,879
right not very exciting so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommend</font>

582
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">some other options one of my favorites</font>

583
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is uh this is something that I put</font>

584
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:05,190
together to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show more impact to</font>

585
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:08,940
developers so I have a first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all i'm</font>

586
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:10,650
using there's like several sites out on

587
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,960
the web that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have vulnerabilities on</font>

588
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,260
purpose one of them by IBM<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tnt</font>

589
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,530
objectives and a kinetics so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

590
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've all seen the boring alert box</font>

591
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:27,480
right not too interesting like

592
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:30,270
developers ask why is that a problem so

593
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">i put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together a little alternative</font>

594
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:38,550
which is the unicorns and rainbow<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font>

595
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:41,910
cross-site scripting and it just fills

596
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,919
your screen and you don't know why it's

597
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,270
doing that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have onmouseover events</font>

598
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,860
so every time you mouse over one of the

599
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,300
images it fires a new image and it just

600
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,350
fills<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen soon that's one option</font>

601
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,970
by the way I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this working on</font>

602
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">every every one of the demo site</font>

603
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,280
another option is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

604
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,310
someone can redirect you very seamlessly

605
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,420
to another site like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing site and</font>

606
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,419
the big one<font color="#CCCCCC"> diggin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is rickrolling</font>

607
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,910
birth my other buddy you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally here</font>

608
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:32,030
long way from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sandlot ok there's my</font>

609
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:34,550
rickrolling and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last one I have</font>

610
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:39,350
is not quite as<font color="#E5E5E5"> dramatic but it's just</font>

611
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:43,240
creating a fake new story oh and you so

612
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,240
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so</font>

613
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,459
all right

614
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:58,160
so quick win number<font color="#CCCCCC"> five implement some</font>

615
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these nifty new security related HTTP</font>

616
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,120
response headers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already mentioned</font>

617
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,620
content security policy and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

618
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn all about that at one o'clock I</font>

619
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:09,290
think it's over in the Magnolia room

620
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">x-frame options is kind of an anti</font>

621
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:14,720
clickjacking defense or where you your

622
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:18,350
site gets framed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another site you can</font>

623
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex frame options header can prevent</font>

624
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:24,730
those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks strict security</font>

625
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:27,820
policy is going to tell browsers that

626
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:31,309
this request if it's going HTTP

627
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,809
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> convert it to https that's</font>

628
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:36,770
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> H that's another header that you can</font>

629
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:40,730
use and see if if it's easy in your

630
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:43,280
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know if changing</font>

631
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,470
code on the functional side is difficult

632
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,240
maybe adding these response headers is

633
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,160
going to be easier and now you can get

634
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that done without with a lot of out a</font>

635
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:56,360
lot of effort another quick win just

636
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,980
make sure your web servers and app

637
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,530
server software is up to date so this

638
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,090
goes back to your patching process how

639
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,990
efficient is that how's it working i

640
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,178
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the bottom line is</font>

641
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">attackers know the vulnerabilities and</font>

642
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:12,890
old versions of code or products out

643
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:14,929
there you know if you run some tests and

644
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see server banners coming back with</font>

645

<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six apache2 tomcat five PHP 5.2 any</font>

646
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:25,490
of these response headers that you see

647
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:27,350
it's probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you're patching</font>

648
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,670
is probably not working or at least it

649
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:35,240
fell through the cracks on on those

650
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:37,670
sites quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> win number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven so engaged</font>

651
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,820
developers and development managers this

652
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,300
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my primary objectives</font>

653
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:47,300
since i started at Sabre<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font>

654
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:52,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure they're keeping security in</font>

655
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:54,080
mind the we're not a financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

656
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,379
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a government contractor or</font>

657
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,780
anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's</font>

658
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:03,200
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their minds up till now so it's</font>

659
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:05,240
a slow process but I'm making<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress</font>

660
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,980
also identifying some champions within

661
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,019
the development organization if I see

662
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,880
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm in a meeting or talking</font>

663
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to someone and they express an interest</font>

664
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,429
or seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to express interest asked</font>

665
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,279
questions about security I make a note

666
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:21,260
of them and kind of my plan is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

667
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,700
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them later make them a champion</font>

668
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,460
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization the development</font>

669
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,470
organization and really avoid the

670
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,840
adversarial relationships Zane Lackey

671
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:34,039
had a good talk yesterday on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

672
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,389
it's like ten o'clock about this make

673
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,889
sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a jerk</font>

674
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:40,309
basically when you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

675
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:41,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers and because that'll they'll</font>

676
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:45,590
shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and they will never talk to</font>

677
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:47,779
you again do lunch and learns have guest

678
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,990
speakers come in at Sabre we have this

679
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:52,250
series that we call security tech talks

680
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:55,370
they're really targeted for developers

681
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:58,399
that anybody can come in fact Joel Joel

682
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:01,489
Escambray or ear came to Sabre and did a

683
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,928
talk for us so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are kind of things</font>

684
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,409
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to keep everyone</font>

685
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:10,340
in engaged hacking demonstrations

686
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:12,860
internal bug bounties so I'm difficult

687
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do because you don't want to end up</font>

688
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,449
with developers writing their own code

689
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:22,539
to have a buy a minivan but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

690
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,250
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some things that can be done</font>

691
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:28,399
you know maybe badges badges for

692
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:31,490
developers that bring an issue to you

693
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,899
that they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to encourage</font>

694
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:38,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive reinforcement on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

695
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:39,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">I got about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes here five</font>

696
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,690
minutes so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of run</font>

697
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:44,120
through this but I'm so I kind of

698
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,940
mentioned early on that in a perfect

699
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can roll out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a program</font>

700
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,070
formalized program everybody's attuned

701
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:56,150
to what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

702
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:58,909
it's directed from above so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is</font>

703
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,390
that on with a maturity<font color="#E5E5E5"> model you want</font>

704
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:04,250
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to define and measure your</font>

705
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,590
security related activities in your

706
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:10,010
development and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> track that over</font>

707
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:12,980
time to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it improves open Sam are</font>

708
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,770
just Sam<font color="#CCCCCC"> software assurance maturity</font>

709
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,820
model from from a wasp is a good option

710
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,110
it's kind of a prescriptive approach to

711
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:25,909
introducing security elements into your

712
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:27,439
sdlc it provides the building blocks for

713
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:32,540
implementing an application security

714
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:35,710
program it's like the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal is a</font>

715
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:39,310
mature application security posture and

716
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,920
that happens over probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> years at any</font>

717
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:45,169
organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has any kind of size</font>

718
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:47,300
and so with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> maturity model like Sam</font>

719
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:51,500
you can demonstrate measurable

720
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:54,980
improvements and incremental

721
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,100
improvements over time so let me talk

722
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an open Sam there's four</font>

723
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,490
business functions divided into

724
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,129
governance construction verification and

725
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:07,460
deployment of software under each

726
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,020
there's three security practices and

727
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,490
it's nicely color-coded so you can

728
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:15,440
quickly see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here so to</font>

729
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:19,399
evaluate where you are in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

730
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">SEC maturity you get rated or scored on</font>

731
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,690
each security practice and the possible

732
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,279
scores are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 to 3 so if you're doing</font>

733
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,080
anything in that particular practice

734
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,910
you're probably going to get a 1 you can

735
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:34,969
also give 1.5 2.5 but you can measure

736
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:37,520
yourself and see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

737
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,319
time as you implement and roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> out new</font>

738
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,270
activities a new activity might be

739
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,100
threat modeling early in the life cycle

740
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,320
it might be defining security

741
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,449
requirements for every project these

742
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> all go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the improving your</font>

743
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,819
maturity over time and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

744
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see for each practice area this</font>

745
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where if it's plotted over</font>

746
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:02,080
time you should see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that improve and get</font>

747
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,080
higher

748
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,130
so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick overview</font>

749
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:14,490
of open Sam there's more here at this

750
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:17,940
URL it's a no boss project there's

751
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,319
alternatives that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one the</font>

752
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,240
one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most familiar with</font>

753
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:24,058
is the BCM and building security and

754
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,308
maturity model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very similar to</font>

755
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,960
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam many of the same activities can</font>

756
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:31,829
be tracked over time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how you're</font>

757

doing but it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a survey a survey</font>

758

of dozens of companies and what they're

00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:42,180
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with application security and then</font>

760
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,519
that can also be tracked over time with

761
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,799
spider charts spider charts allow you to

762
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:48,959
see where you are just like those last

763
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:50,670
graphs I showed and you can see yourself

764
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and compare yourself against other</font>

companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft has a really heavy</font>

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously it's improved their security</font>

over the years and a wasp<font color="#CCCCCC"> another has an</font>

older one called clasp focusing on

770
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,689
unauthenticated for XSS the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

771
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:15,058
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is only due to limited time and</font>

772
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:19,499
resources because if you have an

773
00:36:15,059 --> 00:36:22,710
unauthenticated xss vulnerability the

774
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:25,980
thing that that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes you</font>

775
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:29,220
vulnerable is the possibility of fishing

776
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,529
because you can send<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone an email</font>

777
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,450
with a link that has a link to it the

778
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:35,789
unauthenticated page that has the

779
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,230
vulnerability that can maybe seamlessly

780
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:39,210
redirect them just like the rig rolling

781
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,920
it can seamlessly redirect them to like

782
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:45,089
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing site that looks exactly the</font>

783
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,279
same and they might they might get fish

784
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:50,069
successfully that way if it's an

785
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:52,710
authenticated vulnerability if that page

786
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:55,230
that vulnerability is under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nfa the</font>

787
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,450
authenticated surface area the user is

788
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a login page and they're</font>

they may that may not work as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

792
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,308
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main reason limited time and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">budget</font>

794
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:16,460
all right I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see anything else</font>
