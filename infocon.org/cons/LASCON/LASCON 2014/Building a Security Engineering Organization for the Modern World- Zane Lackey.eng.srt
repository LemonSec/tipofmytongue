1
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so this talk is about building a</font>

2
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,020
building a modern security team and

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what this is is this this talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,859
the talk that I wish I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given</font>

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,599
myself what three and a half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

6
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,120
and when i started at etsy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">building the team there it's really like</font>

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,110
learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my pain right like what</font>

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,970
everything in here probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some</font>

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,680
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subtle mistake that I learned</font>

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,300
from behind it or things like that so

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,960
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the hope of sharing</font>

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,309
this and then yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> like said recently</font>

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,489
helped co-found signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> sciences that's</font>

15
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:53,080
not what this is about at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all actually</font>

16
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,209
so this is really around the the lessons

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,010
learned in building and really adapting

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,350
a team and I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adapting</font>

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,890
part that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to a lot</font>

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:04,540
of folks really across organizations so

21
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,520
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the world has really</font>

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,479
changed for three fundamental ways for

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,210
the way in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've approached</font>

24
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,420
security over the last decade 15 years

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,339
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and the first is the the shift to</font>

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,640
continuous deployment or instantaneous

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,020
deployment and really that shift is so

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,310
fundamental in the way that we've

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,560
thought about application security

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,840
because we've we've really I'll go into

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this in a minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we've really</font>

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,900
approached security as a a gating

33
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,610
function and a blocking function in long

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,740
development cycle so you have no

35
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,080
waterfall and maybe your development

36
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,729
cycle is six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 12 months or 18</font>

37
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">months and somewhere along the way</font>

38
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,520
security is a gate in that and that's

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,900
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,420
things actually operate anymore and the

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,220
way in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

42
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,049
other is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of that you get to watch</font>

43
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,429
me dance around not saying dev app dev

44
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,860
ops<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bullet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right here this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

45
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">development in operations side to do</font>

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,180
that good of a job it really means

47
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,920
especially in startups it means more

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,590
people with access to production right

49
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you have it the superset of</font>

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,569
operations and a lot of development as

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,069
well now has has access there so how do

52
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:15,040
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that from security and</font>

53
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:18,010
then from the offensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> side the cost of</font>

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,560
attack has really gone to not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

55
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,689
but has significantly dropped and and

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,030
what I mean out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are really the</font>

57
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:28,630
proliferation of both tooling techniques

58
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,210
and the attack base<font color="#E5E5E5"> just increasing so</font>

59
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of the agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the talk</font>

60
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,000
going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> through how do you think</font>

61
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">about security and continuous deployment</font>

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,310
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about security in dev</font>

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,530
ops and in a world where more people

64
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,590
have access and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally how do we</font>

65
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,240
use cost of attack not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as a scary</font>

66
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,250
bullet point but actually as a thing

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,930
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a feedback loop into our</font>

68
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,000
security programs in which we really

69
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,520
start to drive good change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make make</font>

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,470
use of that so first what do I mean by

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,660
say near instantaneous deployment I've

72
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,280
got a highly technical chart from how

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,870
deployment used to happen which was you

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,340
would take the bits and you would shovel

75
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,200
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the bit cart and it would go</font>

76
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">down the Oregon Trail and if no one got</font>

77
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,459
cholera oh and 42<font color="#E5E5E5"> River just fine they</font>

78
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,550
would make it to production in about 12

79
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,830
to 18 months and then you'd repeat this

80
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,390
all over again in a axle would break and

81
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,880
then you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an out of and match and</font>

82
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:20,459
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that would be fun what</font>

83
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,680
is this shifting to so i use<font color="#E5E5E5"> etsy as a</font>

84
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,100
case study here but really replace at

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,750
sea in any of this with really any not

86
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,269
just technical organization but with a

87
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,190
lot of organizations so let's see as a

88
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,230
case study deploys the production about

89
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,510
30<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a day on average now this isn't</font>

90
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,030
30 pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code that go to production</font>

91
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,920
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 30 deployments to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> production so</font>

92
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,390
each deployment probably contains

93
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,049
anywhere from like five to eight

94
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">different change sets and you do the</font>

95
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:51,390
shift here is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of what</font>

96
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,460
we used to do in development and much

97
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,559
earlier stages you now actually do live

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,780
in production and so the three kind of

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,320
buckets that that falls into our feature

100
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">flags ramp-up sin na be testing um</font>

101
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,950
everyone calls feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> flags something</font>

102
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,360
something slightly different and same

103
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,429
with ramp up say be testing is a pretty

104
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,440
standard term<font color="#CCCCCC"> though so what I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

105
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is and what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by really</font>

106
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,130
iteration in production is let's say

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,789
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some feature that you're</font>

108
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on and the first thing that you</font>

109
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,330
do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feature is basically write a</font>

110
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,520
giant if statement that says if this is

111
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,770
turned on if this feature flag is turned

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,900
on then execute all the code in between

113
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,609
here and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is you push</font>

114
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,590
that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there into production and then</font>

115
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,760
you start checking in code in between

116
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,409
that if state and you're actually

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,940
pushing that code live<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Prague and</font>

118
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,500
you're testing it on your your

119
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,430
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs your development</font>

120
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,020
environment and stuff like that

121
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,490
beforehand but you're actually pushing

122
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,280
that live in did prod because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

123
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,139
execute

124
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,700
and proud then once you get to a point

125
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you're like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the super early</font>

126
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,840
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this feature is its kind of</font>

127
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,370
ready I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of testing</font>

128
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,020
locally and everything like that now

129
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,790
it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start what's called a ramp</font>

130
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,530
up and so what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing then is</font>

131
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,970
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's it turns out</font>

132
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if statement actually isn't a</font>

133
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,070
binary if statement of you know on or

134
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,440
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it actually is is okay is this</font>

135
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,960
enabled or not and now for enabled you

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,060
can say okay maybe its internal users

137
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,010
only enabled and so you can say okay now

138
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,570
all the employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the company start</font>

139
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,419
to execute this code path and start to

140
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,400
see this feature and so okay great<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

141
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,289
show glue some bugs now let's let's push

142
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,179
those to prod and fix them okay now we

143
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,700
feel confident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

144
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,950
some of our external users okay let's

145
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,349
let's turn that ramp up to now<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of</font>

146
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,640
traffic so now one percent of my the

147
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,010
traffic to my site is going to actually

148
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,440
execute this code<font color="#E5E5E5"> path and and see this</font>

149
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,000
feature and this is where it this is one

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,469
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things where when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see when</font>

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,419
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Facebook or Google or anything</font>

152
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,800
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you see a different screen</font>

153
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,450
for the same functionality than your

154
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,280
friends do what's either happening there

155
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,560
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> either a ramp up so it's either about</font>

156
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go to to 100% where everyone sees it</font>

157
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,790
or they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a be testing which I'll</font>

158
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,160
get into in a second which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> at its</font>

159
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,840
most fundamental level here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> version a</font>

160
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,570
of a page<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is version B of a page</font>

161
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,739
which one does better by some metric so

162
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,719
if you're an<font color="#E5E5E5"> e-commerce company which</font>

163
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,220
one gets people to buy more stuff if

164
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,470
you're a social network which one gets

165
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,210
people to click like more but you're

166
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,240
basically testing hey here's here's my

167
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,859
two hypotheses let's see which one

168
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,270
actually which one actually plays out

169
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,130
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

170
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,630
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so same with ramp ups you ramp up</font>

171
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,640
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one percent okay now ten</font>

172
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,680
percent oh it turns out it at forty

173
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,940
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually a bunch of</font>

174
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,650
performance issues that were super

175
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,020
subtle before actually really crept up

176
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,669
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of scale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's ramp it</font>

177
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,500
back down let's fix those let's ramp it

178
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,580
back up the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaway from the</font>

179
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,320
security side on all of this is that

180
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all happening in production now</font>

181
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,860
right this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big shift for us this</font>

182
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't the testing that you did over</font>

183
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,030
eight months or 18 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> internally</font>

184
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,310
before this ever went live this is all

185
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,359
out there and so just because it's

186
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,830
ramped up to one percent of people

187
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,990
doesn't mean that you know attackers

188
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,090
can't find that so this was my face on

189
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,130
day one of hearing all this in starting

190
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,869
an environment like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

191
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,920
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes against everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

192
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,290
thought of historically

193
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,430
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> app sec right this is oh my god</font>

194
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">what do you mean stuff goes to</font>

195
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,600
production not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day 30 times a</font>

196
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,340
day like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up how</font>

197
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,020
can you possibly code review that before

198
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,219
that goes live ignoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

199
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,810
you never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> code review to</font>

200
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,530
everything before I went live under any

201
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,030
other methodology anyway and oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god</font>

202
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,200
this just sounds terrifying right like

203
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,169
everyone's pushing proud all the time

204
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,300
what do we do so I've gone from that to

205
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,160
now drinking the kool-aid and dispensing

206
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,160
the kool-aid on stage which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

207
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,740
I genuinely feel that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much</font>

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">more secure environment that and it's I</font>

209
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,630
say that for for really one fundamental

210
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,430
reason is that and this is the thing

211
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took me an embarrassingly long time</font>

212
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,330
to figure out is that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not so much</font>

213
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,550
the speed of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> development that that</font>

214
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,140
really influences the vulnerability

215
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,080
count in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> code base or anything like</font>

216
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,880
that it's that bones occur in every

217
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,070
development methodology right short of

218
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,980
like formal proofs for control systems

219
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,380
that are some embedded system like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

220
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,480
for any development philosophy which we

221
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,820
all really follow in this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> Volans</font>

222
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,010
occur in those and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

223
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">change under continuous deployment and</font>

224
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,039
why I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a security</font>

225
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,770
feature and not a security liability is

226
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,120
that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually react in the other</font>

227
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,620
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't really have that ability</font>

228
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,030
to react there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such thing as an</font>

229
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,100
out-of-band how many people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

230
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,770
have lived through<font color="#E5E5E5"> out-of-band patches</font>

231
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,960
at your place of employment<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

232
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,090
and it's terrifying because<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok now page</font>

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,390
all of ops page a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dev</font>

234
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,669
page QA great now it's been at best like

235
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,860
four days rushing through this emergency

236
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,270
QA in it rushing it out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> door and you</font>

237
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,590
know everything's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break at the end</font>

238
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you tack on three more days</font>

239
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,569
of like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> now additional update point</font>

240
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,370
releases for that and continuous

241
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,500
deployment it's just another deployment

242
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,210
right it's no longer that scary

243
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,640
out-of-band patch you're ready to point

244
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 times every day and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what happens</font>

245
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
is when an issue comes in and this was

246
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,430
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword on former there was</font>

247
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,080
like okay great well we reported a

248
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,550
security issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to a vendor of ours</font>

249
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,950
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like okay we will drop</font>

250
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,050
everything we will rush an emergency fix

251
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,580
and it will get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in six weeks and</font>

252
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,319
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't like a fundamental</font>

253
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,990
architectural changes with XSS in the

254
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,270
search box like this was a one-line

255
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,950
change and it took them six weeks of

256
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,990
their release I

257
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh and that was them under like complete</font>

258
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,070
panic mode they're like well we'll push

259
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,880
up our our<font color="#CCCCCC"> six month release cycle to</font>

260
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,530
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks for this so what makes</font>

261
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,600
continuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department safe in all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

262
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I very deliberately say safe instead</font>

263
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,980
of secure is that the nice thing is that

264
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,930
what makes continuous deployment safe is

265
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,850
really from a whole lot of other angles

266
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,380
as well and security gets to latch onto

267
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,300
this like security doesn't have to drive

268
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this change which is completely</font>

269
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,140
amazing so what makes continuous

270
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,240
deployment safe is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little dark on</font>

271
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,040
there but the the instrumentation and

272
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,050
the monitoring and that can the

273
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,670
continuous level of instrumentation and

274
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,560
graphing and monitoring and metrics out

275
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,890
of this right if you have if you're an

276
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,689
e-commerce site again and you just push

277
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,699
the production and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the grid the money</font>

278
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,350
graph just goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

279
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">checkouts are happening you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

280
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,800
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> just went wrong right you have</font>

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to wait for customers to write a and say</font>

282
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,150
hey I can't buy items on your site that

283
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,010
graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> just went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

284
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,930
the same way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a really</font>

285
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,650
strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> parallel to that's even darker</font>

286
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,530
that's a plane so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a</font>

287
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,810
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong parallel to to aviation in</font>

288
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,189
this regard of you can push the

289
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,290
production without any of these graphs

290
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,480
just like you can fly without any of

291
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,430
these control without any of the the

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,810
instruments or anything like that it's

293
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,030
just landing becomes pretty difficult

294
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,619
right and the same way here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can push</font>

295
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,350
to prod you just don't know if you broke

296
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,450
everything or not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

297
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">same culture that is inherent to what</font>

298
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,950
you need out of continuous deployment

299
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,690
and out of a fast release cycle you get

300
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,400
to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security you don't</font>

actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the crazy driver of</font>

302
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,490
that and say no to know trust us we need

303
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,989
graphs everyone else already he says

304
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we need graphs to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

305
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,340
like great security needs grass<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and</font>

306
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,470
the the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson learned out of</font>

307
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,440
that was really not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> building things</font>

308
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,060
for the little security bubble that that

309
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,940
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security organizations tend to</font>

310
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,910
live in its surfacing it for the entire

311
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,440
organization the key is if you can

312
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice on here the key has include some</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is is not so much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the graph</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">itself as where you put this graph in</font>

318
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,390
your organization this is no longer the

319
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,880
ok this is on like

320
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,210
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop near me in my one area this is</font>

all of these other graphs that are going

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">on here all rights surfacing this</font>

324
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,010
because the thing that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going for</font>

325
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,930
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McHale process is really</font>

326
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,960
well is that don't treat security as a

327
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,910
binary event I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that that</font>

328
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,760
we end up the trap that we end up

329
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,199
falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> into his most organizations is</font>

330
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,140
seen like security<font color="#E5E5E5"> as one of two states</font>

331
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,430
either we are everything's fine or we're

332
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,230
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front page of the Washington John</font>

333
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,939
like Washington Post right and we're

334
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,030
either owned or not we're owned or not

335
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,830
and so surfacing them the million states

336
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,839
in between there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

337
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,040
most critical things you can do well

338
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,050
that's on the app check side of the net

339
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,579
sex ID or anything like that from from

340
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,949
the secured side surfacing that to the

341
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,760
rest of the organization is

342
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,640
fundamentally critical because what

343
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,360
happens is when what you're going for is

344
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,949
a shift from<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract to concrete you're</font>

345
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,900
going for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought of okay if</font>

346
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,910
I'm writing code if I'm a fungal web

347
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,380
developer at an organization and I'm

348
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing code I know what's going on the</font>

349
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to</font>

350
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,660
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> it abstractly I know I need to be</font>

351
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,980
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things like I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of</font>

352
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,480
cross-site scripting and sequel

353
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
injection all this sort of stuff it's

354
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,170
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different when you're walking by to</font>

355
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,280
grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> coffee and you're seeing a spike on</font>

356
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,050
a graph that's an order of magnitude

357
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,640
more than you've ever seen and you're

358
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,020
like what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is that like oh</font>

359
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,760
that's people<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for sequel</font>

360
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,829
injection in their app right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you</font>

361
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,380
shift from that abstract knowledge to

362
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,770
very concrete measurable things you say

363
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay no I get it now right like this</font>

364
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:50,420
this stuff is actually happening so how

365
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,490
do you build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the culture that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

366
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,110
invites it i'm sad the moment doesn't

367
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,170
come through quite well there but it's

368
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,330
it's fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way in which we shift</font>

369
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,680
to continuous deployment is by removing

370
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,510
all those blockers right you'd have a

371
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,280
six-week development cycle or a

372
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,110
six-month development cycle let's say

373
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,880
six months then you have two months to

374
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,590
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of QA then you'd have maybe</font>

375
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,990
that a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks of security and</font>

376
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,700
maybe some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other testing and then it</font>

377
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,950
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> go live and then stuff would break</font>

378
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,000
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would ping the developers</font>

379
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,650
from that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like that</font>

380
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,810
was eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what</font>

381
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:24,439
that code even does and you rinse and

382
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,359
repeat the the key here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that when</font>

383
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,779
we're removing all those blockers and

384
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,949
it's no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that huge sigh</font>

385
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,199
and you're writing code and your

386
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,729
shipping it to prod if security tries to

387
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,290
function in the same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being like oh</font>

388
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,720
we're the blocker where's your security

389
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,279
sign off it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter you get</font>

390
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,009
routed around right if I'm a developer

391
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,680
and I can commit and push to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prod and</font>

392
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,209
I'm a just random developer and security

393
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,378
shows up it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh no that's going to</font>

394
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,989
need a security of your view and we're

395
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:51,180
busy and that'll be like four weeks like

396
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,829
cool no no problem i'll i'll come back

397
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,620
to that total oops it's hump rod

398
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:57,269
surprise right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get routed</font>

399
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,410
around if you become the blocker in the

400
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,009
organization then you are the

401
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,600
bureaucracy that gets routed around so

402
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:05,009
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to what we need to focus on</font>

403
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,779
and this is really a shift in the way

404
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:09,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done security for a decade is</font>

405
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,009
that you now need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> incentivize people</font>

406
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,269
to reach out to you right it's no longer

407
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,089
the oh you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go get the security</font>

408
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:17,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">check box before it goes to prod now its</font>

409
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,410
interest goes to prod and did you talk

410
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,870
to security maybe maybe not and it was

411
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of to you so what were the the hard</font>

412
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,949
lessons learned out of that the first

413
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,160
one seems incredibly dumb but there is a

414
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why it's the first bullet up here</font>

415
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,420
it's that the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as a security</font>

416
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:35,040
team when someone comes to you with an

417
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,059
issue or even they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't come to you</font>

418
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,949
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue you find a vulnerability</font>

419
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,240
and you go to some development group and

420
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:40,949
you're like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dumbest thing</font>

421
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,949
I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen you see where you call</font>

422
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">eval on the get parameter like that is</font>

423
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,939
what what the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do that</font>

424
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,350
you not only lose that individual

425
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:53,939
developer you lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of their peers</font>

426
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,620
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment that people</font>

427
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:57,180
feel stupid talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and that</font>

428
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,559
you're a jerk they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not talking</font>

429
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,628
to you anymore and the worst part of

430
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,269
that is it fails silently like you don't

431
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:04,829
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lost that group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you're</font>

432
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,120
super busy anyway you don't even realize

433
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there they haven't talked to you in</font>

434
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,389
like eight months<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're like oh</font>

435
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,559
weird and it's kind of strange last time

436
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,730
I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them I made fun of them and</font>

437
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,990
they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back it's really</font>

438
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,040
really strange the other side is the

439
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,269
other side is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to actually</font>

440
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,290
make trade-offs I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

441
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,230
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we historically do a</font>

442
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,679
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad job of as security we tended</font>

443
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,839
to view it as i love<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alex thomas put</font>

444
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,249
this as security nihilism right if we

445
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,589
can't do everything there's no point in

446
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:34,290
anything and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if there's if there's</font>

447
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:36,329
we found 10 voles in this block of code

448
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:39,269
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 have to be fixed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before it goes</font>

449
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,689
to prod because because security and the

450
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,490
real

451
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,530
these a million shades of gray in

452
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,480
between and being able to make realistic

453
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,550
trades off<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-offs on that and be</font>

454
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,220
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like okay here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 issues</font>

455
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,719
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your code here's the two that</font>

456
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,980
actually matter like here's the two that

457
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,140
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get us owned right away</font>

458
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,360
because not only are they trivial<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

459
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,130
find their trivial to exploit so here's

460
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,990
why they here's why it matters and

461
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,420
here's the trade I'm willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make if</font>

462
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,300
you guys can can get to these two then

463
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,860
these other eight if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get to</font>

464
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,569
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the next few weeks after you</font>

465
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,950
ship that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair enough trade to me</font>

466
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">and here's why I think that's a fair</font>

467
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,620
trade because these other ones maybe

468
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,720
they're easy to find but they're

469
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,190
difficult to exploit or they're easy to

470
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,680
exploit but difficult to find or

471
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully difficult on both sides but</font>

472
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,400
you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that trade-off and</font>

473
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,860
you're you're demonstrating that it's

474
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,760
not it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you find security</font>

475
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,320
issues you're not going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

476
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,780
blocker about all you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

477
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,480
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-offs the other side of that</font>

478
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,449
is be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to really explain why so not</font>

479
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the oh because insert security term</font>

480
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,380
of the day here right oh this needs to

481
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,540
be fixed because that's improper input

482
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,610
validation like cool that doesn't

483
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,589
actually tell me anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

484
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell me if I'm a developer that doesn't</font>

485
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell me like okay why do I care yet that</font>

486
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,770
sounds bad because it's improper and

487
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,090
validation but why do I actually care

488
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,860
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the walk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and be</font>

489
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,290
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten here's the true</font>

490
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,850
that matter here's why this one when you

491
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,110
put in something like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

492
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,820
the user data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're able to get</font>

493
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of it so maybe in some cases this</font>

494
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,170
means like demonstrating an exploit for

495
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,149
something usually it doesn't actually

496
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,829
mean that usually it just means not

497
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,420
lapsing into security jargon and saying

498
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,490
like okay here's what this actually

499
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,319
means this is how you exploit it this is

500
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,390
what you get this is why it's easy and

501
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,470
then dumb culture stuff of just like

502
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">rewarding communication if you're trying</font>

503
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change behavior how do you change</font>

504
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,869
behavior you reward good behavior out of

505
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,060
this and what was what was hilarious<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

506
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,860
dumb to us was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the simple</font>

507
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,290
things that are really effective at at

508
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,909
this so we made a bunch of like security

509
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">team t-shirts and we would give them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

510
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,770
to bug bounty participants and things

511
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,360
like that but internally we would give

512
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,980
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> out if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you did something awesome</font>

513
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,449
for security so whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

514
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,490
come ask us a question about hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

515
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,230
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this feature I know I'm</font>

516
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,240
supposed to protect user data should I

517
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,500
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing hashing or encryption like</font>

518
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,270
awesome here's a t-shirt and

519
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,710
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down and walk through this we</font>

520
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,870
also do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing with gift cards</font>

521
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,700
as well like hey you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even talk to</font>

522
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,290
us about an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> it didn't have to be</font>

523
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own issue something hey I came</font>

524
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,230
across this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the code base this feels</font>

525
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,360
really weird you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind taking a look</font>

526
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,970
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like awesome here's a here's a</font>

527
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,979
gift card ah internally because you

528
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,170
actually get the reverse out of this of

529
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,150
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first bullet where when you're a</font>

530
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,190
jerk you not only lose them you'll lose

531
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">all their peers it's the reverse with</font>

532
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,820
this you not only get them you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

533
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,530
their peers to because they go back to

534
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,700
their desk with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your new t-shirt or a</font>

535
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,170
gift<font color="#E5E5E5"> card or anything like that like</font>

536
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,310
sweet the security just gave me a gift

537
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,080
card were just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some line</font>

538
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:30,520
of code over there like oh cool well

539
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,050
I've written a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs I'll go</font>

540
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,110
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them about that like that's call</font>

541
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,610
gonna get a ton of gift cards the most

542
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,909
controversial one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

543
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,810
really depends on organizational saws is

544
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,520
taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> false positive hit yourself</font>

545
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,200
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is something we've</font>

546
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,010
also historically done a really poor job

547
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,610
of you get the the magic security scan

548
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:54,100
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 10,000 pages and you hit</font>

549
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward on that to the lead developer of</font>

550
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:00,879
some group and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> security like fix</font>

551
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,199
that the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time you</font>

552
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people probably take it</font>

553
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,500
seriously and they're like okay great

554
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,750
here's this report oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000</font>

555
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,370
issues ah great let me start working

556
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,290
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get through the</font>

557
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,459
first 50 and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them</font>

558
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,980
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a false positive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

559
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,720
like cool now I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the issue is</font>

560
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,400
here the issue is i'm not flagging every

561
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,410
email from that security person as spam

562
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,470
right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you actually solve</font>

563
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,840
that problem as a rational organization

564
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,670
so as a security team taking the false

565
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,620
positive hit yourself now why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

566
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is controversial is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're what it</font>

567
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,949
feels like the trade-off is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

568
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is actually the trade-off it</font>

569
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,320
feels like you're trading time for value

570
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,149
in a sense because let's say your

571
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,500
security team is you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people</font>

572
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,270
and your development organization is

573
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,650
much bigger and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying okay well</font>

574
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,850
if we have to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these scam</font>

575
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,800
reports and everything like that before

576
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,750
we send it on that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> take us weeks</font>

577
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,620
versus if we just send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font>

578
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,480
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right away</font>

579
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,530
the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the underlying assumption</font>

580
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,730
there is totally wrong that they're

581
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right away that</font>

582
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,220
they're not spam filtering all that

583
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,709
stuff after you the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you set</font>

584
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,300
them at completely crap report so taking

585
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,160
that hit yourself actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

586
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,409
really is a trade-off why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that</font>

587
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,650
that really gets controversial is as

588
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,790
your organization scale

589
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,590
you have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a bit differently</font>

590
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,210
right as you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from hundreds of</font>

591
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,250
developers to thousands to tens of

592
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,780
thousands this starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

593
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,890
well how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really take the false</font>

594
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive hit ourselves when our</font>

595
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,040
development organization is 20,000

596
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,140
people the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font>

597
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,730
scale on that is and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way typically</font>

598
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,950
people do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a central</font>

599
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,630
security team that sets policy then you

600
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,190
have embedded teams at kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that the</font>

601
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,990
individual business unit or vertical

602
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,000
level and then you have individual teams

603
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,920
usually even at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point in that the</font>

604
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,480
individual product level and so you

605
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,010
actually can scale with that by

606
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,480
embedding teams and other organizations

607
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,900
that's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> nother talk in and of</font>

608
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,690
itself how you scale effectively kind of

609
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,150
in between there is you go via your team

610
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,680
leaves so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation which you're</font>

611
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid is that it doesn't</font>

612
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,890
matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're hiring security</font>

613
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,230
people you're hiring other engineering

614
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,450
folks faster right so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though let's</font>

615
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,470
say let's say you start and you do a

616
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">great job of convincing your</font>

617
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,390
organization that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font>

618
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,920
to security six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months from now your</font>

619
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,200
organization is different is wildly

620
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,970
different and so the way in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

621
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the way which we found this to be</font>

622
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,540
effective is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> via the team lead so</font>

623
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,460
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and building relationships with</font>

624
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teammates now I say leads</font>

625
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,750
that doesn't mean the team manager that

626
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,590
doesn't mean the the technical lead of

627
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,790
that team it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just the most</font>

628
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,379
developer on that team it could be

629
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,629
whoever is kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the influential</font>

630
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,360
figure of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> team because what you're</font>

631
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:32,090
going for there is when a new engineer

632
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,139
joins that team and goes to do something

633
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,730
in production whether they're shipping

634
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,530
code or they're making a production

635
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,910
change on some system and the

636
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,350
influential person of that team says

637
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,300
cool what security have to say about it

638
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and their first reaction is probably a</font>

639
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,649
fairly rational one of like why would

640
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,389
you ever talk to those guys and then the

641
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,560
team goes back and says no no we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

642
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,110
here so go bounce it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they're</font>

643
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,100
not going to block you and go back to it

644
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,500
off them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then come back and let us</font>

645
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,939
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they say you never had to have</font>

646
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,380
that training conversation with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

647
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,990
developer somebody else did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for you</font>

648
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,210
and so you're able to scale that way

649
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so second section of the talk</font>

650
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,520
really the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of DevOps side of things</font>

651
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so its up front it's very simple access</font>

652
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,629
control in startups there is no and

653
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,700
startups you should really air quote

654
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:17,870
here because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like most</font>

655
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,750
organizations the thing is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you grow</font>

656
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:21,679
or as different things happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

657
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,870
I have pressure whether that's

658
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,520
regulatory whether that's compliance

659
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,770
whether that's just you're trying to

660
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,090
you're now a you were a group of five

661
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,040
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now you're a group of five</font>

662
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,090
hundred and not everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font>

663
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,180
access to the production database

664
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,580
anymore the biggest lesson learn out of

665
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,430
this is don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take away capabilities</font>

666
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,199
take away access so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give a</font>

667
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,790
methodology for this and then i'm going

668
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give like a specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of this</font>

669
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:49,250
so the key is figure out what the

670
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,680
capability is like what's needed and why

671
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,480
so it's not just people just ssh into

672
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,920
production web systems they're not doing

673
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,270
it just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're bored they're</font>

674
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it to get their job done so</font>

675
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,800
figuring out what they're actually doing

676
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for is the first step build then</font>

677
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,639
this is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the big like</font>

678
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,770
all-encompassing step is go build an

679
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,300
alternate method for that right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

680
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,550
may take you six hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may take you</font>

681
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,050
six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on what it is but</font>

682
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go build the way in which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's</font>

683
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,280
actually safe you transition the

684
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,530
organization over from from the unsafe

685
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,639
to the safe and then you either this is

686
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,070
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a bit fuzzy either you</font>

687
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,020
alert on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old unsafe way or you shut</font>

688
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">off access or things like that so some</font>

689
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,920
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the example i've seen over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

690
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,969
over and over at different organizations

691
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,590
is ssh access to prod one of the most

692
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,390
common reasons why it's done is oh you

693
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,730
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go debug something you got some</font>

694
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">some report from customer support or</font>

695
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,300
something like that there's no real

696
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,830
repro steps in it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some info</font>

697
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,720
where you could go like grab the error

698
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,899
log off of production web and start to

699
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,240
debug that way at least what's the

700
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,320
approach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay from security</font>

701
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,780
securities freaked out because everyone

702
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,980
has access to prod but the development

703
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,660
organization needs to do this to be able

704
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do their job so the way what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

705
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,870
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is okay well what you</font>

706
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,850
actually need access to our the logs you

707
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,590
don't need access to production so

708
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,780
building that alternate approach up ok

709
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,790
let's syslog it to a central box that

710
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,310
central box is either elasticsearch or

711
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">splunk or whatever you know tail and</font>

712
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,840
grep then you publicize that too when

713
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,310
you say okay look this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you need</font>

714
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do your like this is what you needed</font>

715
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get your job done before here's an</font>

716
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,860
even more efficient way hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought</font>

717
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,870
to go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and now you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for</font>

718
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,610
like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> box you off to SSH into one of</font>

719
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prods now you can actually</font>

720
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">just get it from the central source and</font>

721
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,030
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where you can start to fail</font>

722
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you can start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fail</font>

723
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,860
softly at first so you could start

724
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,510
this bullet I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put like 18</font>

725
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,250
on a on a slide but this actually

726
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,740
becomes like five different ones and you

727
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,830
can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> First Alert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just alert on</font>

728
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,659
anyone accessing prod okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> now people</font>

729
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really transitioned over so access you</font>

730
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,159
know alert on anyone who's not supposed

731
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:54,190
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it ok now let's roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out to</font>

732
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,840
factor but still allow access<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

733
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,730
at this point like the organization has

734
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,320
changed enough where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even need</font>

735
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,400
to allow access<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore and so you can</font>

736
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,139
kind of soft a grade rather than just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

737
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,419
elasticsearch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cabala are alive next</font>

738
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">day access to prod is gone right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

739
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:10,750
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you end up taking away</font>

740
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,610
capabilities at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz people</font>

741
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">aren't used to the new to the new</font>

742
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,168
approach okay final section<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally</font>

743
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,070
a corgi slide it's taking us way too

744
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,960
long to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one specifically on bug</font>

745
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,470
bounties and then on attack simulations

746
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,120
and pen testing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug back does anyone</font>

747
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,590
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here run like a public but Daniel or</font>

748
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,959
is involved in a public bug bounty

749
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,959
program sweet so yeah so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost</font>

750
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">slept a couple years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago right so</font>

751
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,620
they're tremendously useful and I really

752
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe this they're tremendously useful</font>

753
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,969
with a few caveats and I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

754
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,950
with you after and more depth on this

755
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,059
the the caveat is don't just rush into

756
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,380
it because everyone's doing it like

757
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,639
you're making very realistic trade-offs

758
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,230
here and you need to understand what

759
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,960
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting into but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you do that</font>

760
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,730
they're incredibly useful the two most

761
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,590
common ones that the two most common

762
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,330
concerns I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from talking with</font>

763
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:00,850
organizations working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on launching</font>

764
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,830
there's are either budgetary or risk so

765
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,299
budgetary the funny thing is almost no

766
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,970
one who's involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bounty program</font>

767
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:08,200
is primarily motivated by money as they

768
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,460
might be somewhat motivated by money

769
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,090
because no one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

770
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,830
money but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see this over and over and</font>

771
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,330
over again in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction with your</font>

772
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,399
different researchers that right in is

773
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,168
that what they want is Hall of Fame they

774
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,908
don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they they'll</font>

775
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:23,169
take the money but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you're</font>

776
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,789
like sorry there's no money for this bug

777
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:25,960
that great give me Hall of Fame or if

778
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,039
you even just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like now sorry this</font>

779
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,950
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on our whole fam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they like</font>

780
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,020
please but I tried like Hall of Fame is

781
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,090
what is what they want and then risk of

782
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,860
inviting attacks at this one's kind of

783
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,439
hilarious and in one sense is that like

784
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,779
you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet like yeah</font>

785
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,399
bet the the quote I love here is like

786
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,630
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the internet you already get a</font>

787
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,189
free pen test you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get the</font>

788
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,679
report now you do right

789
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,409
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big goals out of the the bug</font>

790
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,820
bounties are really three things it's

791
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,379
incentivizing people to report issues to

792
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,918
you in the first place this may seem a

793
00:26:54,379 --> 00:27:00,259
little a little crazy if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't</font>

794
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,990
really spent time on offense but there's

795
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,519
a fundamental fear on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

796
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,169
researcher and the offensive side so

797
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,059
that was all my background before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Etsy</font>

798
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:11,600
and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that even in this</font>

799
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,549
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2014 it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still in the mind of</font>

800
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,469
different offensive folks finding bugs

801
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:17,960
it's 5050 if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get sued if</font>

802
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,120
you report an issue right if you report

803
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,950
the safest way as a as a vulnerability

804
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,229
researcher or is any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of offensive</font>

805
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:26,330
researcher if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a bug in company X</font>

806
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,340
my safest way to do it is just to throw

807
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up on pastebin anonymously and like</font>

808
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,178
let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with the consequences</font>

809
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,740
they'll you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get fixed but</font>

810
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:36,289
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get sued and that's</font>

811
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,570
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary that that's always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

812
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,220
very scary thing and that's what the

813
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,408
whole responsible disclosure debates

814
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,240
came out of and what bug bounties came

815
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:46,129
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that is that this is a very</font>

816
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,200
explicit promise from<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

817
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,610
saying we are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to sue you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

818
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,379
you play by these rules and you send it

819
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to us rather than just sending it</font>

820
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:56,000
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the New York Times the</font>

821
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">other and this is really for your</font>

822
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,450
security program is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

823
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,879
drive up the cost of vulnerability

824
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,769
discovery and exploitation and the ways

825
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:06,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">in which you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really you really do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

826
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,100
are obviously on vulnerability discovery

827
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:09,799
you're hoping that you've got more

828
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,178
people looking that's trending down the

829
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,809
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug so hopefully it's more</font>

830
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to find bugs for some classes</font>

831
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,168
that's true for some that's kind of not

832
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,429
but then driving up costs of

833
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:20,419
exploitation the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

834
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,610
that is you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better as an</font>

835
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:24,350
organization responding your first time

836
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,969
and I'm jumping<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead a couple sides</font>

837
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,408
here but the the first time that you

838
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,730
have bug reports come in you're running

839
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">around with your hair</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on fire figuring</font>

840
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,669
out like okay what's the best way to

841
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,870
respond to all this by six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

842
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,929
you're like cool another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's liya</font>

843
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:38,029
the fixes live we're good and then

844
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,860
really providing the feedback loop of

845
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:42,289
where you're doing well and where you're

846
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,610
not this one's huge because you can you

847
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,990
can build all the metrics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

848
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,580
internally of oh look we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

849
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,409
vulnerability class trending down over

850
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,460
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got you know all these</font>

851
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:51,860
reports that said we're doing a good job

852
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,740
here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet has a way of</font>

853
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,779
disagreeing with your internal metrics

854
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,520
so seeing what actually comes in that's

855
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest thing getting this outside</font>

856
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,090
back loop in the same like in the same

857
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,470
way that you do with pen testing all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

858
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,510
times it seemed like okay well we did a

859
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,300
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff here let's see how that</font>

860
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,379
actually fared what you want to what you

861
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about before you launch</font>

862
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,670
one is recording what vulnerability

863
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,140
classes you expect to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what you</font>

864
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:18,260
don't so like hey we think we do a good

865
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,600
job of sequel injection a pretty good

866
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,450
job of stored XSS know k job of

867
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,000
reflected and a crappy job of<font color="#CCCCCC"> da max SS</font>

868
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,410
then see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when issues</font>

869
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in do they line up with</font>

870
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,990
what your expectations are because

871
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,030
that's your feedback loop of saying oh

872
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:34,040
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought we did a good job of this but</font>

873
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:35,450
a ton of issues just came in actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

874
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,460
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start approaching this in a more</font>

875
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,440
systemic way it's it's more systemic

876
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,410
that we thought let's go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really</font>

877
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">change our approach here the two metrics</font>

878
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,950
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want out of this and I talked</font>

879
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,450
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is your number of bugs and</font>

880
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,700
their severity these are the things you

881
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:52,370
want to trend down over time and then

882
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,380
same with time to remediation so first

883
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,729
time comes in you as an organization you

884
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,830
just haven't had to respond to as many

885
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,290
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get better and better and</font>

886
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,780
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this over time and so you want</font>

887
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to the if the same bug came in</font>

888
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,370
on day one of your bounty program and at

889
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:09,680
day 1 plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight months the time it</font>

890
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:13,459
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should be</font>

891
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:16,010
dramatically Aloha here's a key lesson

892
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,140
learned let everyone know not just your

893
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,430
engineering teams on this let everyone

894
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,500
know that you're about to launch a bug

895
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,820
bounty team especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that are</font>

896
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,000
not even technical teams like your

897
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,760
customer support team letting them know

898
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,530
that everyone is about to be attacked

899
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,590
and the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for us was</font>

900
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:35,300
that attacks start almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately</font>

901
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,860
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did do a super publicized</font>

902
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,210
launch we did a couple of us mentioned

903
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,129
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and then we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font>

904
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:43,760
blog post about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this was not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

905
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:46,070
big news event this was we just were

906
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,320
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right cool we're live tweeted</font>

907
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:53,060
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 minutes before the graphs went off</font>

908
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chart so the biggest takeaway out of</font>

909
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,179
these and this this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that I</font>

910
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,330
thought was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting was that</font>

911
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,970
in pretty much every organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

912
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,710
talked to it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really your first two to</font>

913
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,240
three weeks like ballpark<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out is your</font>

914
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,400
first month I'm curious like did you

915
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,220
guys see something similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that you</font>

916
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,220
see like first month yeah so like first

917
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,380
month is really where the mo

918
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,970
hectic time frame is and at about at

919
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,679
about a month out the pace<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

920
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,360
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point is really the</font>

921
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,520
pace that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on until</font>

922
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,990
you until you republish eyes it or you

923
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,870
like raise your vulnerability reward

924
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,190
level or something like that but those

925
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">first two three weeks are going to be</font>

926
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,299
intense and the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why I really</font>

927
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,428
mentioned that is know what you're

928
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,408
getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> so recognize that ok for</font>

929
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:37,270
those first couple like<font color="#E5E5E5"> two three weeks</font>

930
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:39,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">we really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit pause on a bunch</font>

931
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other projects and we need to have</font>

932
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,879
people ready like people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

933
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,140
ready not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> our security team but the</font>

934
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,059
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our engineering teams and that's</font>

935
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,620
really where you you give people heads

936
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:48,940
up on that say like look<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight years are</font>

937
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,789
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in and we're going to need</font>

938
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,520
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> fist fixed even faster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than we</font>

939
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,020
normally would because as a bug bounty

940
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,460
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> name gets made in your first couple</font>

941
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,260
weeks it's gonna be those first couple

942
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,700
blog posts that come out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say these</font>

943
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,679
guys were<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're terrible to deal with</font>

944
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,030
or they were they were great to deal

945
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,100
with and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> responded instantly and</font>

946
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,260
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back that very first bullet</font>

947
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,360
point of the the thing you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

948
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,250
do out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is incentivize people to</font>

949
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,049
talk to you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first place and if</font>

950
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,330
all the blog posts come out and they say

951
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey these guys were complete clowns to</font>

952
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,720
deal with and they took six months to

953
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,760
fix a symbol like simple issue and they

954
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,200
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to me about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

955
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,169
lose that whole incentive and you lose

956
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,620
the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your book back program this</font>

957
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:31,929
one's unfortunately has to be vague but

958
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,570
think about the systems which you rely

959
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,740
on as a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and go make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

960
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,570
they're not running at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine</font>

961
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,429
percent of capacity the day that you're

962
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,960
launching a bug bounty program because

963
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:45,039
when they fail three hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

964
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,140
hypothetically it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> annoying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

965
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,580
go take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like I said money</font>

966
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,770
the reason I brought this back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

967
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,449
that understanding when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

968
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,190
interaction with your researchers that

969
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,659
their motivation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

970
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,700
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like that's usually what we</font>

971
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:58,780
started out with of like okay are they

972
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to argue with us about them out</font>

973
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:04,750
and everything like that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

974
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:06,220
get into this afterwards but people

975
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,330
arguing with you about amounts and

976
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,429
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost never happens</font>

977
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:14,620
actually we had it happen well twice

978
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:17,890
once we're in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in like a year</font>

979
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a half once was where the researcher</font>

980
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,320
didn't understand the issue that they

981
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,700
had they thought they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a much more</font>

982
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,780
severe issue than they didn't so they're

983
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">like why you giving me almost nothing</font>

984
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,040
for this and like here's why here's the

985
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,540
exact

986
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pro steps for your bug here's the</font>

987
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">write up that you should have sent us</font>

988
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,490
for this bug here's what the actual

989
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,690
impact is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay get it and then the</font>

990
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,300
other was just from extortion attempt

991
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,540
and so those those are fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> too you can</font>

992
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,280
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that conversation over beers and</font>

993
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,139
then the key to interaction and the way

994
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,790
you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good name is just frequent</font>

995
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,840
communication this was I mean that

996
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,820
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious but let me give a</font>

997
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,179
specific example it doesn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

998
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,040
be your response time to the issue so

999
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,930
you can they can write in and you can

1000
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,760
you can say cool got your got your stuff

1001
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,390
we're investigating<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we investigated</font>

1002
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,560
we confirmed ok now we confirmed but

1003
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,540
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take us six months to</font>

1004
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,730
fix and that's kind of where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect</font>

1005
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to freak out six months why can't</font>

1006
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,060
you fix this immediately that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1007
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the thing if you can give them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1008
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,029
like a reasonable reason I hey or you

1009
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,230
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to given that much of</font>

1010
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,030
reason be like this is actually a much

1011
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,740
deeper issue than it looks it's going to

1012
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us six months to fix but here's</font>

1013
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,139
what we're going to do we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1014
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,428
keep in contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you throughout and</font>

1015
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,989
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1016
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,610
deadline slips and we're gonna let you

1017
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,810
know what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for those six months</font>

1018
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,400
once a month you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them an email</font>

1019
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,290
saying like hey this don't fall off our

1020
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,540
radar we're still working on this still

1021
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:31,460
looking like six months that's the key

1022
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,929
as long as you if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say up</font>

1023
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,449
front Oh looks like six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and then</font>

1024
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never write back I guarantee they're</font>

1025
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,290
going to set a calendar reminder for six

1026
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,790
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> from there go test it and if it</font>

1027
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,590
is not to the minute six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1028
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,590
there's going to be a blog post going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1029
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:48,380
of like oh they<font color="#CCCCCC"> brush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me off right okay</font>

1030
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:52,480
final section and it's got tuxedos so

1031
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:54,620
it's classy so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really a a</font>

1032
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,969
rethink of the way that we do pen

1033
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,620
testing and the problem with with pen

1034
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:02,779
testing is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were more pen</font>

1035
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:04,609
testers oh ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really feel that the</font>

1036
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,320
the problems with pen testing are very

1037
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:07,940
well understood from the offensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

1038
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,260
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pen test side and what I think</font>

1039
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it really boils down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and I'm</font>

1040
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,920
really speaking more on kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that the</font>

1041
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,460
network pen test side at this point is

1042
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,280
that that term has become so overloaded

1043
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,260
that it people your your customers that

1044
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,610
are buying a pen test think they're

1045
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,430
getting one thing and you're delivering

1046
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:27,560
another and that's not negative from

1047
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:30,649
from either side it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1048
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,570
terms have really gotten so confused so

1049
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,610
at this point what pen test typically

1050
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,120
mean is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is more properly</font>

1051
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,400
called vulnerability numero

1052
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,440
you go a numerate a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs you</font>

1053
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,700
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a report and you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1054
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,980
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your blog to soar high mediums</font>

1055
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">lows here's your steps to reproduce them</font>

1056
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,960
all that the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the</font>

1057
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,910
customer takes at and well in reality

1058
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,750
fix it fixes almost none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them what</font>

1059
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,210
tells you they're going to go fix a

1060
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,590
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and they start working</font>

1061
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,750
their way through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that</font>

1062
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not how attackers actually</font>

1063
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,140
operate against your environment right

1064
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,370
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go scan and go okay well</font>

1065
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,509
here's all my house and then I'm going

1066
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work my way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through those and then</font>

1067
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,630
like started<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about mediums and</font>

1068
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,430
all that in reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that owns</font>

1069
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,560
you up as organ as like owns us up as

1070
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,700
organizations is usually half the time

1071
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,440
like a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowes all chained</font>

1072
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,169
together stuff that never even shows up

1073
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,400
in the report in the first place so the

1074
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,920
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about</font>

1075
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,380
running actual attack simulations is

1076
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,540
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to see how real</font>

1077
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,370
attackers achieve your goals against

1078
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,440
your organization it's not just showing

1079
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh what compromise was possible if you</font>

1080
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an organization compromise is</font>

1081
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,890
possible full stop and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1082
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,170
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way that bug bounties are</font>

1083
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,520
really good feedback into your app set

1084
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,500
program of what's working what's not

1085
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,900
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good feedback into your</font>

1086
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,610
net sec program of really both what's

1087
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,170
working what's not like where did we

1088
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,670
thought we have really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good detection</font>

1089
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:50,160
mechanisms that did not work at all in

1090
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,480
practice these compliments everything

1091
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,279
else that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing of enumeration</font>

1092
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,100
and compliance and all that fun stuff

1093
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,040
but these are in addition to these are

1094
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,330
not replacement<font color="#CCCCCC"> of so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four I tried</font>

1095
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,500
to distill it down into four things that

1096
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we learned running a bunch of these</font>

1097
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,970
first is make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal-oriented so</font>

1098
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,030
obtained domain admin read CEOs email

1099
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,529
whatever the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one was</font>

1100
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,610
asking your attack team four goals<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1101
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,990
don't just go to them and say like

1102
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,240
here's the four goals aware that we're

1103
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,500
worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ask them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they would</font>

1104
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,669
do if they were targeting an

1105
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,900
organization like you because I

1106
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,860
guarantee they're going to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of that</font>

1108
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,270
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been just as damaging this is</font>

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> far the most controversial and</font>

toughest one up here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> full</font>

1111
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,120
organization in scope so I expect a

1112
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,589
couple chuckles under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the breath of</font>

everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the offensive side and</font>

1114
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,760
from the defensive side I expect a bunch

1115
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,770
of migraines to instantly appear because

1116
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,680
you probably want this too and it's

1117
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,910
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough and what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by for</font>

1118
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,830
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> in scope is that</font>

1119
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,629
traditionally pen tests are done with

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your two by two so</font>

here's you two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two weeks</font>

1122
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,859
here's your scope you can target

1123
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,330
these development systems and this

1124
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,920
network but don't touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything over</font>

1125
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,140
here and definitely don't touch anything

over here meanwhile your attacker

1127
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more hilarious to your</font>

1128
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,430
attackers than the concept of scope

1129
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">right because they don't have any of</font>

1130
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're like oh yeah cool no I'll</font>

1131
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,520
definitely go for your dev systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yeah</font>

1132
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,560
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on production right and so the</font>

1133
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,509
the keys in which we tried to mitigate

1134
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,350
risk out of this is how do you because

1135
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,180
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're worried about from</font>

1136
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the defensive side is great I want to</font>

1137
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,919
understand the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hopefully</font>

1138
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,259
how do I mitigate risk because I know

1139
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,580
with my luck the first time I run one of

1140
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,860
these someone's going to crash a prod DB

1141
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:27,130
and I'm never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get one to run</font>

1142
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:29,050
one of these again<font color="#E5E5E5"> at best so what we</font>

1143
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:32,320
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that is like first this in a case</font>

1144
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:35,770
like okay they had gotten to a point in

1145
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">our network where they were now they</font>

1146
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,370
could now hit like a production database

1147
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,640
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cool we've gotta gotta know</font>

1148
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:44,080
day for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it lands like</font>

1149
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighty-five percent of the time and if</font>

1150
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,319
this was actually a real thing where we

1151
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,359
were talking yeah we'd throw that

1152
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,860
because we like those odds but you know

1153
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,780
the odds of actually testing like

1154
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,790
Murphy's Law it would crash<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time</font>

1155
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,320
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool here's what we're</font>

1156
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,600
going to do we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simulate as</font>

1157
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,740
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> went forward with that step but</font>

1158
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,910
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate the risk of it</font>

1159
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,830
so what we're going to do is we're going

1160
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:05,140
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local account on that box as</font>

1161
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,850
the my sequel user and give you ssh

1162
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,890
creds for them so now you get to move

1163
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward to that box but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font>

1164
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,490
to throw an exploit that might knock out

1165
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,649
a production DB and you get to then move

1166
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward and so how do you see like okay</font>

1167
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,470
and this is what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend the</font>

1168
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,390
time working ahead of time with your

1169
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,370
your team<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same like okay when you</font>

1170
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,440
get too risky points like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

1171
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,660
someone either directly on the security

1172
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,250
team who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> their contact or as you can</font>

1173
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,660
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and start to have more fun</font>

1174
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,460
where the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually in</font>

1175
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,170
the dark about this testing they call a

1176
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and they call cut out say hey</font>

1177
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,650
we're at a certain point and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut</font>

1178
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">out says okay great let me get you</font>

1179
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,710
access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because the security team</font>

1180
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,540
is trying to hunt you right now anyway

1181
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,520
and if you told<font color="#CCCCCC"> them where you were</font>

1182
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,759
about to hit they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go focus on</font>

1183
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,440
that the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> estate this is the whole</font>

1184
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,810
basis i should start this part earlier

1185
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the whole basis of like what the</font>

1186
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,350
tax aims actually are which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is realistic</font>

1187
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:56,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise patterns how we're actually</font>

1188
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:58,420
getting owned his<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that</font>

1189
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,740
means if you want to simulate a client

1190
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,550
side or a fishing campaign or anything

1191
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,799
like that start them on a standard

1192
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,930
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laptop or a desktop this whole</font>

1193
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,790
concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of starting external or you know</font>

1194
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,680
perimeter or anything like that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

1195
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:13,100
it was even<font color="#E5E5E5"> true in the first place it's</font>

1196
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,480
certainly not true today and then the

1197
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,220
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of like oo days like that</font>

1198
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,510
was cheating like you have a ride yes

1199
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,580
but it couldn't detect that Eau de like

1200
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,530
the reality that's not that's not

1201
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,290
cheating doll if they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a shell</font>

1202
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,670
it's not cheating and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally break</font>

1203
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,350
this is just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the logistic side</font>

1204
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,210
is typically these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> done like I</font>

1205
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,440
mentioned before I two by twos and then

1206
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,810
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a status report at the end of</font>

1207
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first week and you get a deliverable</font>

1208
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,160
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second week in reality</font>

1209
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,700
it takes way way less time to actually

1210
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,170
own organizations so in especially to

1211
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,490
achieve those different goals so it's

1212
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,320
like oh my goal was to read the CEOs

1213
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,899
email yeah I got that in like 36 hours

1214
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,910
right and so what you want to be

1215
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,410
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about on this is talking with</font>

1216
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,299
your attack team's I'm saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay as</font>

1217
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">you hit goals either do one of two</font>

1218
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,920
things either then start again and go

1219
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,440
for a different goal or start again

1220
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that same goal in a different</font>

1221
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,890
way or start again for that same goal

1222
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,419
but with a different team so maybe

1223
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,279
there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> five consultants that are</font>

1224
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,510
lined up but<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one or two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

1225
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,730
operating at time and as they achieve a

1226
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,440
goal swap another one in because what

1227
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,380
you're trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of all of this</font>

1228
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,090
is data you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as much data</font>

1229
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,680
given that you're constricted by budget

1230
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,020
that you can't run these sort of things

1231
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,049
all day every day forever you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1232
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,910
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year at best get as much</font>

1233
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,650
data out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you possibly can and</font>

1234
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,029
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is not the oh there is a</font>

1235
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,830
bug here and there's a bug here in its

1236
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,320
bug here that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter bugs are</font>

1237
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,330
actually really<font color="#CCCCCC"> irrelevant if there's a</font>

1238
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,040
controversial and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say bugs actually</font>

1239
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,560
irrelevant in this case of what you're

1240
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,020
really looking for is how do people move

1241
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,670
right and so much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lateral movement is</font>

1242
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,080
you know compromising credentials at

1243
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,420
different points and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then moving as your</font>

1244
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,790
legitimate users actually do and so what

1245
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,310
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is why how and why</font>

1246
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,470
did your attackers go from A to B to C D

1247
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,570
and just as importantly what they didn't

1248
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,980
do so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have built a bunch of</font>

1249
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,720
like really good detection stuff and

1250
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,400
you're like at this point in the network

1251
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,290
like haha we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to totally detect</font>

1252
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,730
these guys and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may get an email</font>

1253
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:06,259
like three days later and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

1254
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,060
and they were super slow why<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't we</font>

1255
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,230
detected them yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and three days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

1256
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,558
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email that I cool we're done</font>

1257
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,599
we got all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

1258
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,609
great detection mechanism like how did

1259
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">we not catch you there and it turns out</font>

1260
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:18,519
like oh well maybe if you built a

1261
00:42:17,229 --> 00:42:20,618
detection mechanism to see how people

1262
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing network enumeration and</font>

1263
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:23,890
figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out your network but you forgot</font>

1264
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,569
that your internal wiki is totally

1265
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,459
authenticated and your net ops group

1266
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:29,140
posted all the network diagrams in that

1267
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:30,279
totally unauthenticated and your

1268
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,420
attacker the first thing they did was go

1269
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:33,279
to the wiki and just look at the network

1270
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,079
diagrams and be like I never need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

1271
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:36,969
a single network enumeration thing in my

1272
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,410
life I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly where every box is</font>

1273
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:41,249
then they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go trigger your</font>

1274
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:43,899
your different detection mechanisms cool

1275
00:42:41,249 --> 00:42:46,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides here I'm</font>

1276
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:48,069
totally over so i'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like a</font>

1277
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:49,629
question and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll just hang out</font>

1278
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:51,849
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the talk right out there so</font>

1279
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,799
if there's any questions like I said

1280
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're really going for realistic attack</font>

1281
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:57,819
behaviors and patterns and different

1282
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,439
profiles so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other thing is</font>

1283
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:01,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your attackers are all not all one</font>

1284
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,979
in the same both in skill level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1285
00:43:01,239 --> 00:43:04,930
profiles so their objectives<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

1286
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">smash-and-grab get the database they</font>

1287
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,259
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> care if you detect them and</font>

1288
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:10,299
get out it may be just maintain

1289
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,739
persistence to an organization for when

1290
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,630
you want to achieve different objectives

1291
00:43:11,739 --> 00:43:16,029
later you want to simulate both of those

1292
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:19,119
because what you're looking for is what

1293
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:20,349
signals overlap of those where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1294
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,789
detection points where it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

1295
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,099
that their objective was just a maintain

1296
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:25,809
persistence or was to smash and grab at

1297
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,519
a certain point<font color="#E5E5E5"> they went through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Point</font>

1298
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:29,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">C and that's where you start building</font>

1299
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:32,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">your detection mechanisms so in</font>

1300
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:34,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">conclusion the way in which we adapt to</font>

1301
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps in continuous deployment are</font>

1302
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:38,259
surfacing security monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1303
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:40,179
metrics to the entire organization not

1304
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:42,969
just to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> security teams you really</font>

1305
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:44,380
need to shift from this this thought of

1306
00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:45,849
security being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blocker because that's</font>

1307
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually going away and how do we</font>

1308
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:49,420
incentivize teams to come talk to us and

1309
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:51,459
then don't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away capabilities take</font>

1310
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,539
away access and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the way in</font>

1311
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:55,239
which you start to really drive up

1312
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,859
attacker cost is through feedback loops

1313
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,239
of realistic data of how people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1314
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,859
actually compromising<font color="#E5E5E5"> our systems</font>

1315
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,199
through bug bounties and through tax

1316
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:04,439
simulations and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome thank</font>

1317
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">you for coming</font>

1318
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,270
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a lot of organizations</font>

1319
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,590
you see a lot of network metrics up on

1320
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,120
TVs on the walls but you don't see

1321
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,220
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of those reasons might</font>

1322
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,509
be from the legal perspective that legal

1323
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,580
is worried about vulnerabilities and

1324
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,980
things like that can give you two

1325
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,360
answers the first is don't tell legal

1326
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:27,330
that one camera still on so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1327
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:30,390
with that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actual advice the</font>

1328
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:33,920
the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is that you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1329
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:36,240
to be surfacing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> detailed like</font>

1330
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,430
exploitation steps to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> surfacing good</font>

1331
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,529
info right you can service a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of info</font>

1332
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,759
in aggregate of here's how people are

1333
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,430
looking for vulnerabilities and things

1334
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,920
like that that I feel I mean I'm pretty

1335
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:51,450
far from a lawyer but I feel like are

1336
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,790
the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off of giving concrete</font>

1337
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,740
info to folks without giving like hey

1338
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:57,150
here's brand new vulnerability X and

1339
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,500
here's how you exploit it in anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1340
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,840
walks by gets to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it even if they're</font>

1341
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a guest visiting for lunch right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1342
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that there's because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1343
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,759
that's a real concern i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1344
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,160
that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid question is that you</font>

1345
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,660
still want the absolute details of of

1346
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,009
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kept within the</font>

1347
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,020
security team or shared kind of as

1348
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,570
needed but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that all of</font>

1349
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,610
the info right like somebody somebody

1350
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:19,620
looking for sequel injection and the

1351
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,450
exact payload that's going to dump out

1352
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:25,440
your users table are two different

1353
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:28,319
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that side Nancy Cruzan cool</font>

1354
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:32,060
all right I'm gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> off stage but I</font>

1355
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,060
will be right<font color="#CCCCCC"> back there</font>

1356
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,089
you
