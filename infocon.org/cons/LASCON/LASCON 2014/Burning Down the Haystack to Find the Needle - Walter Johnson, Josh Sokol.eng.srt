1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,990
so today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:25,660
security analytics and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">security analyst program at an eye for a</font>

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:32,019
couple years now 23 years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

5
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:34,480
that we've gotten to be really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

6
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:36,010
because we have so few people on the

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,690
team in fact you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the two</font>

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,750
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the security team at</font>

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,260
national instruments so what we found is

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,839
by doing security analytics by running

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,790
analytics on our environment that we're

12
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,280
actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the work of many</font>

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,750
many more people so hopefully by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,910
of this talk you guys will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

15
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,530
tips you'll have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific things</font>

16
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you guys can run in your</font>

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment they'll get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you up and</font>

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,390
running and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make your job easier so</font>

19
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,800
Who am I I'm Josh<font color="#CCCCCC"> sokol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a member of</font>

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,509
called simple risk and I'm the

information security program owner at

25
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,560
national instruments i also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,450
mention real quick if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you flip your</font>

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,569
badge over to the side that doesn't have

28
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,789
your name on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a QR code there</font>

29
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:26,739
there's also some pretty pictures and

30
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:29,319
whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comm badge game</font>

31
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:32,640
and so far the UT ISO group is the only

32
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:35,770
one who is actually competed in and

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,060
completed the last comm badge game so if

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,649
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are interested it shouldn't</font>

35
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,360
take very long it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

36
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,890
can do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your phone we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:48,429
cool prize for everybody who completes

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:52,750
it just saying I am Walter pushed but it

39
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:54,910
is long is it testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you go I am</font>

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,330
Walter and this is my I forgot to give

41
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,340
Josh a bio slide slide so he just filled

42
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,929
it out for me as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,440
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> him at national instruments I'm</font>

44
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:08,289
doing security analytics I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the shirts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the badges for the</font>

46
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,569
most recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> last cons like past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,569
years

48
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,000
I do enjoy long walks on the beach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,800
candlelit dinners and they made me

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">remove my tattoos but I am a former</font>

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,580
Yakuza assassin yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here</font>

52
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,400
is visibility right when we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

53
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,320
at our environments there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this</font>

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,150
complete lack of visibility into what's

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,700
going on in our environments in our case

56
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,770
we've got a global company 100-plus

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,239
branch offices around the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

58
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,060
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">answers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these questions up here can</font>

60
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys honestly look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this list of</font>

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,180
questions up here and say yes I can

62
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,980
answer all those and my goal here is at

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,630
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the presentation you should</font>

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,220
be able to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things when you</font>

65
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,829
go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your environment now the</font>

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,900
solution here is going to be that we

67
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,910
have to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ecosystem of security</font>

68
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,820
tools we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be able to take all of</font>

69
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,380
our tools break them out of their

70
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,109
individual silos and get them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

71
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,820
together to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer these questions we</font>

72
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">need tools are able to kind of talk to</font>

73
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,410
each other to leverage data from one

74
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,120
tool to the next data we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform</font>

75
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,269
that enables the analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all that</font>

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,950
data in near real time so that we can

77
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,050
see what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in our environment</font>

78
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so what we really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need is Korean</font>

79
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,860
Linux most of your environments are

80
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,080
probably going to look something like

81
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,090
this you're going to have lots of

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,070
different tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's awesome but</font>

83
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,830
those tools sit within a silo and

84
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,630
because they sit within that silo one

85
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,790
platform doesn't talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another doesn't</font>

86
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,410
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another but the fact is data</font>

87
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,530
from my firewall can actually be used

88
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,690
for my IPS system or data from my

89
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,430
vulnerability management scans can be

90
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,670
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine whether an attack is</font>

91
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,800
valid through my IPS system so all these

92
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">things really should be working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

93
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,820
but the fact is in most environments

94
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,859
they're not we have things like

95
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,750
proprietary protocols we have platforms

96
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,280
that say give me gimme gimme but don't

97
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,019
give back and we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,550
duplication of functionality so what

99
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,120
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out is how we</font>

100
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:12,459
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of that I gave a talk a few</font>

101
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back talking a little bit about</font>

102
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,478
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff called the magic of symbiotic</font>

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,100
security and in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk way it is I</font>

104
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,519
kind of broke this out in terms of

105
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,130
providers and providers were systems

106
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,469
that like to give data things with open

107
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,040
API is open<font color="#E5E5E5"> databases the ability to</font>

108
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,660
export

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,570
out and then I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font>

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,640
consumers and consumers were able to

111
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,159
consume that data so they looked at

112
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,830
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> and alerts and SNMP and syslog</font>

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,600
and things like that and by kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

114
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,880
classifying tools in terms of these two

115
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,220
categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got a much better feel for</font>

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,690
what our environment was capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some</font>

117
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,810
of our tools are consumers some are

118
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,390
providers some are both one note<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

119
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,580
consumers can be greedy and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

120
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,740
by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have a lot of um a</font>

121
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,409
lot of platforms especially when you're

122
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,060
talking sim or log management where they

123
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,570
say gimme gimme gimme but they're not

124
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,010
willing to give back and so we need to

125
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,830
we need to try and avoid those common

126
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,380
platforms because that those kind of

127
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,510
platforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't help us if our</font>

128
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,280
goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create symbiosis in our</font>

129
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,110
environment so we do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

130
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,750
and leads to something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I refer to</font>

131
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,520
as symbiotic security we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

132
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,350
able to take all of our tools in our

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,590
environment we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to assemble kind</font>

134
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,570
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> arsenal best-of-breed tools and</font>

135
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:33,340
even smaller tools can have a very large

136
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:36,070
impact in our environment this guy right

137
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,260
here by the way is an Egyptian plover

138
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,900
bird and he actually has a very

139
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,719
symbiotic relationship with the

140
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,219
crocodile this guy so the crocodile will

141
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,250
go and he'll eat you know whatever

142
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,810
animal it eats that day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wednes up</font>

143
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,090
happening is that meat gets stuck over

144
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,740
you know left over his teeth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that</font>

145
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,630
meat were to stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> his teeth it would</font>

146
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,460
rot in his teeth teeth would rot and it

147
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,670
would fall out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this little bird comes</font>

148
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,049
along he eats that meat off of there and

149
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,270
he removes that he's basically like the

150
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">dentist for this guy but the same time</font>

151
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,659
he gets its food it's a very symbiotic

152
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,539
relationship and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

153
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,910
trying to accomplish in our environment

154
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,370
so different questions will require

155
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,470
different types of data and so that's

156
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,270
kind of what what this is looking at is

157
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,590
all the different questions that you

158
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">would want to have answered in your</font>

159
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,669
environment and where that data is

160
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,530
probably seeing in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment so</font>

161
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,290
if the question is do I trust the source

162
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,940
of some traffic in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my environment I may</font>

163
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,340
want to look at reputation data and

164
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,890
there's love sources that you could go

165
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,219
to for that information or a feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

166
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,599
question is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who do I trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,390
who trust me maybe

168
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some sort of a hierarchy or what</font>

169
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,110
can I access there's probably some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,970
of authorization data so all these

171
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,590
different questions have different

172
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,810
answers and those answers are usually

173
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,130
sitting in those silos somewhere what we

174
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,990
need to figure out is how do we take

175
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,850
that data break it out of those silos

176
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:02,530
kind of feed it off and do do work on it

177
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:06,550
have any of you guys ever heard of flow

178
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:10,440
or net flow good that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic so</font>

179
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,540
what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we've used flow data</font>

180
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,630
for a lot of this what we've looked at

181
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,540
is the ability of NetFlow data or<font color="#CCCCCC"> J flow</font>

182
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,010
or just flow in general this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a common</font>

183
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,320
feature for modern routers and switches

184
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,450
so if you go out you buy an air prize

185
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,310
grade you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco router or something</font>

186
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,159
like that chances are high that that's

187
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to do net flow</font>

188
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,580
net flow is a summary protocol it

189
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:39,730
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks it looks at IP source IP</font>

190
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,190
destination ports protocols volume of

191
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:44,380
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data itself so</font>

192
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,360
you will never get from net flow what

193
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happened on the network but</font>

194
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,930
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know where it went how</font>

195
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,820
it went what ports it went to things

196
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,530
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's proving to be</font>

197
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,080
extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the day</font>

198
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,239
itself won't be valuable but<font color="#CCCCCC"> when space</font>

199
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,169
is a hot<font color="#CCCCCC"> commodity and you know dis</font>

200
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,140
space is expensive at times you know

201
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:08,770
this actually it's a quick easy cheap

202
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,560
way to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gil live data of it</font>

203
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,659
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a lot of data for</font>

204
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,060
reasonable amount of storage and our

205
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,260
data via net flow can help make our

206
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,940
security decisions far easier so what I

207
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,159
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the course of</font>

208
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,260
this presentation we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a</font>

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,450
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we're using the flow day</font>

210
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,980
afore how we're taking data from some of

211
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,990
those silos kind of pulling it in

212
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,969
looking at the data across our whole

213
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,180
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I wanted to get started</font>

214
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a really simple example to kind of</font>

215
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,699
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> elaborate on this so a while back HD</font>

216
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,530
Moore wrote a paper i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

217
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">security flaws</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and universal plug</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in pet</font>

218
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,839
play and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what HD said is he</font>

219
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,000
scanned the internet and he found over

220
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,890
23 million ip's that were vulnerable to

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,430
remote code execution through a single

222
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,589
UDP

223
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,810
packet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought oh you know that's</font>

224
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting I work in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a company</font>

225
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,459
that does measurement testing automation

226
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,440
national instruments that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

227
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we would probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have and I</font>

228
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,110
thought man we may have exposure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

229
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some guy over an RD who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

230
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">through for a hole through the firewall</font>

231
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,140
going to some system singing as desk and

232
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,689
what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ramifications if this</font>

233
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,660
this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an exposure point for</font>

234
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">us so this particular vulnerability I</font>

235
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,529
effects ssdp simple service discovery

236
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,450
protocol which runs on UDP 1900 so you

237
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:34,899
know we had a pre finite set of

238
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,930
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> its UDP it support 1900 so</font>

239
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,940
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our people actively scan</font>

240
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,529
my network in order to exploit this flaw

241
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,959
is somebody trying to find this are

242
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,330
there barbarians at my gate so to speak

243
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,459
and so the first step in answering this

244
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,610
question is to define<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it is that</font>

245
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:54,099
we're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so to do this what</font>

246
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:56,770
I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I created a simple query I said</font>

247
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok my source address is going to be</font>

248
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,949
something outside my networks I'm

249
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,050
looking for people scanning me for this

250
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,480
my destination is going to be an IP

251
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,930
address inside my network and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

252
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,540
find anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that range where the</font>

253
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:14,199
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses UDP which is protocol 17</font>

254
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,110
on port 1900 ssdp sounds extremely

255
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,060
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan and so what I've done this</font>

256
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,860
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the tool that we use it's</font>

257
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,930
called links and I'm not a Salesman for

258
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,910
Langston or anything like that but this

259
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the tool that we've chosen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do net</font>

260
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,610
flow analysis and integration with some

261
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,860
of our systems and so this language

262
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,779
right here is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> pql its pattern</font>

263
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,940
query language it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

264
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">started basically at the top here we</font>

265
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,860
create an instance in our instance is

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,990
each of the different pieces that we're

267
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,640
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to query on so in this case I've</font>

268
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,310
created an instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a source address</font>

269
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,529
where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not internal I've created an</font>

270
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,660
instance for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a destination address where</font>

271
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,700
it is internal and then I've said give

272
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,459
me a network connection where it's UDP

273
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,890
port 1900 very simple I think everybody

274
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,540
can understand that here we define what

275
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,650
connects to what so we say the source

276
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,569
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the source address</font>

277
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,579
destination connects the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

278
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we say when you give me the</font>

279
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,199
results I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the source address</font>

280
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,390
in

281
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,540
the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> address very very simple</font>

282
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,160
query all the queries are like this so

283
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,810
it's really easy to kind of you know

284
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,120
create a pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

285
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get results on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so the</font>

286
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,660
results that we end up game back<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font>

287
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,850
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pattern</font>

288
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">search of our net flow data just net</font>

289
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:31,600
flow at this point over the past 24

290
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,790
hours and it returned 539 results and

291
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,040
that query took about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute and 38</font>

292
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,810
seconds or so which isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> too bad you</font>

293
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,810
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go get a cup of coffee come</font>

294
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,699
back and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data right the end</font>

295
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,140
results look something like this there's

296
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,080
a tabular view and then there's the

297
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,280
ability to look at the actual graph

298
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,190
analysis and what you see are these kind

299
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cool patterns it's almost like an art</font>

300
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,420
project or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

301
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,880
interesting to look at but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see this</font>

302
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of hub and spoke model and what you</font>

303
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,110
have is a single system<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the</font>

304
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle with a whole lot of other systems</font>

305
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,950
all connecting of that single system so

306
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,480
it's a graphical view of what this

307
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,590
connection looks like it's all the

308
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,690
patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found in our</font>

309
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,250
environment so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to zoom in on</font>

310
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,830
this a little bit this is what it looks

311
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,660
like so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a system our network</font>

312
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,870
right here you can see you know it's a

313
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,939
little computer screen there and then

314
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,490
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these guys around here I removed</font>

315
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,110
a bunch of the extraneous data but each

316
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,300
of these guys on the outside are

317
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,970
somebody outside of our network trying

318
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,250
to connect to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine via UDP port</font>

319
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,200
1900 these are the guys these are the

320
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,000
barbarians arrogate these are the guys

321
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,890
who are actively<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploits and</font>

322
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,320
it has some nice features we're gonna

323
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,530
give us flags and whatnot you know us

324
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,450
would never attack us right so that

325
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here and so I'll</font>

326
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,810
give you another<font color="#CCCCCC"> example here just to</font>

327
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,430
come now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point home so in this case</font>

328
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,260
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a source address</font>

329
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,359
that's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our network we're looking for</font>

330
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,760
a destination address that's external to

331
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,800
my network and we want a destination IP

332
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,180
that's listed in the mail or domain list

333
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,550
are you guys familiar with Mallory

334
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,680
domain list if not you probably should

335
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,229
be it's free you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware domain list</font>

336
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">comm and basically what they have on</font>

337
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> site is a list of all the systems</font>

338
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,570
that they've recognized as being our

339
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,400
domain either host or command and

340
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,670
control servers it's a list of IP

341
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,069
addresses its list

342
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,199
domains and you can take that data and

343
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,660
then you can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries against it so</font>

344
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a report that will run</font>

345
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,030
on a daily basis in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environment and</font>

346
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we look at the results on a daily basis</font>

347
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,510
because we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there are any</font>

348
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,290
systems in our environment that been

349
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,439
compromised I and our communicate with

350
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,480
these systems on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> command and control</font>

351
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,520
so we look for source address our

352
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,260
network destination addresses external

353
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,810
and then things in the mail or domain

354
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,350
list so very simple source address is

355
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,180
internal destination is not internal we

356
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,120
bring in another event here which is the

357
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:02,239
event from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a malware event</font>

358
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,430
basically and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at the source</font>

359
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,930
address destination address and then the

360
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,670
malware target and actually when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

361
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,880
looking at this I'm knowing that this

362
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:14,150
query does not actually do this so we

363
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,360
messed up in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that slide but the</font>

364
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:19,910
end result looks something like this so

365
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pattern search for a net</font>

366
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,890
flow and this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> our mail or</font>

367
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,610
prevention clients or fire I system over

368
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,650
the past hour I returned 134 results two

369
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,960
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and four seconds and it's really</font>

370
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:36,199
interesting because what you see is this

371
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,570
is how our system in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

372
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,270
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bomb here that means that that</font>

373
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is not our system</font>

374
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,960
this is the system they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> connecting to</font>

375
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,670
this little bomb is associated with that

376
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,530
that's the actual malware target and

377
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,449
then these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all the systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

378
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that are connecting to that guy</font>

379
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:56,870
right so that's a surefire sign that

380
00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:00,709
there may be an issue there closer

381
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,870
inspection some detail removed again in

382
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,760
this case here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one system there</font>

383
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,380
that everybody's talking to you here's

384
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,120
all the systems on our network that are

385
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,520
talking to that and then that's the

386
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,230
malware event the guy that's associated

387
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,750
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's go and talk</font>

388
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some useful security networks talk</font>

389
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:24,350
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dark Knight one you are so</font>

390
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,170
this is another report that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

391
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,120
run on a daily basis what we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

392
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,459
we've created a list so we have a very

393
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">large you know I p</font>

394
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,230
range internally and what I did is I

395
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,650
went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said okay out of this</font>

396
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,020
huge range we're obviously not using

397
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,030
every single IP address out there so

398
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,949
let's look at the ranges within that

399
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,199
range the sub ranges that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

400
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,750
using that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have systems on and</font>

401
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,430
then let's look for all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

402
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,050
systems in our environment that are

403
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,400
talking to those IP ranges and it

404
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,930
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter if there's a system there</font>

405
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,000
or not we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to see if</font>

406
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,949
somebody's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so what</font>

407
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,140
we do is we create create that list of

408
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,580
unused IP addresses we look for those

409
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,110
internal systems that are making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

410
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,240
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> connections to the IP and the way</font>

411
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we say our source is</font>

412
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,920
going to be internal our<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination is</font>

413
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,839
internal as well and the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is</font>

414
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,990
in this list that I've created<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

415
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:20,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">our darknet IP space and then we run</font>

416
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> query we export and then we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

417
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,670
results back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us a count</font>

418
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,189
of the number of times a system our

419
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,770
network has attempted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect to a</font>

420
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,380
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in that dark necklace now</font>

421
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,569
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely useful where you have</font>

422
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,790
a system that's been compromised and all

423
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,100
of a science doing scanning activity so

424
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,110
you will see this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll go it</font>

425
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't know which ip's have stuff in</font>

426
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,390
which I PS don't and inevitably<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

427
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit an IP address in this dark</font>

428
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,189
net space so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can very easily detect</font>

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,110
when that happens and we can find those

430
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,270
machines so anything that connects to

431
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,160
one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems in the dark net is</font>

432
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,620
either misconfigured and probably should

433
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,910
be addressed or<font color="#CCCCCC"> its compromised very</font>

434
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:07,569
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple another way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

435
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,730
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS requests so depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

436
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,490
your environment is set up this can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

437
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:15,700
this can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really useful or it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

438
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,959
really really troublesome what we're

439
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,420
trying to do here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

440
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,610
look for systems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environment that</font>

441
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,950
aren't connecting to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers so</font>

442
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully most enterprises environment</font>

443
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,970
will have an internal dns server all of

444
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,290
your internal systems will connect to

445
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that guy maybe it's a domain controller</font>

446
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,280
or something like that and then that one

447
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,200
system makes all the app bound request

448
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,600
on behalf of your organization that's

449
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,240
typically how it works and so what we're

450
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is any system that's</font>

451
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,570
actually making calls to a different DNA

452
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,850
server not our dns server so an external

453
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,158
query and so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do this is</font>

454
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,080
we look for a source that's internal we

455
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,690
look for a destination that's not and

456
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,408
then we look for anything using UDP 53

457
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,149
that should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS query right and so</font>

458
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:03,100
by doing this we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to run that</font>

459
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,959
that query we look for anything for the

460
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,730
destination IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the number of</font>

461
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,009
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we're able to get that</font>

462
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,740
list of systems that are making those

463
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:14,169
external DNS requests and for us you

464
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,659
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's going to google and</font>

465
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:19,240
maybe we don't care you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe it's</font>

466
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:21,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some other weird dns server and</font>

467
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,129
we do care so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a good way to</font>

468
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,409
detect certain types of malware but it

469
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:28,959
does require your environment to have

470
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:31,360
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locked down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS on your desktop</font>

471
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,860
level by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way if anybody has</font>

472
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,498
questions feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to raise your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

473
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:41,289
interrupt us and happy to answer oh yeah

474
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:44,259
yeah we find stuff i would say at least

475
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:47,529
on a weekly basis will find systems with

476
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:49,179
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> analytics absolutely in fact i</font>

477
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,679
would i would argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these kind of</font>

478
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,990
analytics they work better than

479
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:56,740
antivirus they were probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font>

480
00:18:52,990 --> 00:19:02,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">even our fire I system so Jeb becoming</font>

481
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,690
what's the query this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah p ql</font>

482
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:07,059
having query language is what the

483
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,249
language is called well we'll take that

484
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah i don't want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

485
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:14,289
Salesman I don't sell the product they

486
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,110
don't pay me to pitch it so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

487
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:20,740
point of this presentation were we're

488
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking generalities all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

489
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:27,999
we talked about this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns a data</font>

490
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:30,399
exfiltration so this one has has proven

491
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:33,249
to be valuable in certain cases in kind

492
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:35,018
of a time suck in other cases but here

493
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:37,149
what we're doing is we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

494
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:41,409
all the data that's leaving the company

495
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:45,428
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm creating here a top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 list of</font>

496
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:47,169
the most data that's being sent at you

497
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:49,119
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you'll find false</font>

498
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:52,240
positives you'll find especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

499
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,908
environment we have a lot of engineers

500
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,080
who will<font color="#E5E5E5"> send you know large ISO images</font>

501
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,669
to a customer things

502
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,529
like that so we do find some false

503
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:01,330
positives with this but we also find

504
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,340
some stuff we're like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's a</font>

505
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,110
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of data going to some IP</font>

506
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,049
address in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia what's up with that</font>

507
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,490
right so in this case we're looking for

508
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,620
a source address that's on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

509
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,779
we're looking for a destination address

510
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,129
that's external to our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

511
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,260
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is being sent</font>

512
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,360
outside and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sum up the</font>

513
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,879
number of bytes sent and we get the top

514
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,029
25 that boil up so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this works in</font>

515
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">PQ el we limit 25 that says just show us</font>

516
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:31,149
the top 25 results is internal it's true

517
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,559
for the source address it's false for

518
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,320
the destination address we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

519
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,149
connections and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we run the the</font>

520
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,830
results we look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source the</font>

521
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:41,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination we actually pull in the</font>

522
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,019
country code the destination ports we

523
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,450
know which ports it's going to the count

524
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,010
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sum and the the content</font>

525
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,470
actually ends up being interesting

526
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,389
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see if there's a lot of</font>

527
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,429
little bits of data over you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

528
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:57,158
large time make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up or if it's just</font>

529
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,269
like 50 packets were you know a hundred

530
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">gays right so that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helps out a lot</font>

531
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:06,159
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find a lot of stuff with the day</font>

532
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,230
exfiltration especially in the lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

533
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,139
overseas branch offices where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

534
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,820
have have the same my detection

535
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanisms that we would our corporate</font>

536
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,720
office yeah so then we have network

537
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,720
reconnaissance this report right here

538
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:31,360
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right I told Walter just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I can</font>

539
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,190
keep talking forever right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

540
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,678
so network reconnaissance so in this

541
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,360
case we're looking for systems that have

542
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,039
been compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're scanning our</font>

543
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,860
network for stuff and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be like</font>

544
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">a nmap scan or you know something like</font>

545
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,969
that and NASA is so you know somebody

546
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing discovery on our network basically</font>

547
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,630
so in this case we're looking for source

548
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,490
address that's on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network we're</font>

549
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,649
looking for a destination address that's

550
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,720
not on our network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we want to</font>

551
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the count of connections AIP makes</font>

552
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,970
any other IP address and so I very

553
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,750
simple we've got all those different

554
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:07,419
pieces here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we export sensor</font>

555
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,240
ipv4 this simple fan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex of what we're</font>

556
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing here is we're</font>

557
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,730
we doing a nested search it will run

558
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:16,730
over that and they'll do a research of

559
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,640
that data to give us the count and the

560
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,320
sensor IP so the sensor IP is actually

561
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually kind of an interesting data</font>

562
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,649
point what happens is your net flow

563
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,110
comes from multiple points on your

564
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and so depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where your</font>

565
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,879
sensors are you may see data across

566
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,980
multiple net flow sensors so what this

567
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,860
guy is telling me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here is which</font>

568
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,510
sensor we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding that data on and so</font>

569
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,370
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see traffic in multiple senses</font>

570
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,940
this will actually show up in two

571
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,129
separate areas so this this actually

572
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,110
ends up being kind of interesting when

573
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,420
we have weird IP addresses that show up

574
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,889
on here things like that we're actually

575
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,690
able to track it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to the exact</font>

576
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:01,640
device that that traffic was passing

577
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">through all right so here's one for</font>

578
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,190
system analysis this is outbound

579
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:09,530
connections by protocol so in this case

580
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,480
we're looking for a source IP that we're

581
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,700
going to specify and so if I have a

582
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,250
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and I'm thinking man</font>

583
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,040
maybe that system is compromised maybe I

584
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,020
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look more into what that thing</font>

585
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,990
is actually talking to this is the great

586
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,600
way I do it so in this case we look at

587
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,850
source address that we we specify we

588
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,709
look for a destination address and we

589
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically run that over and the end</font>

590
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">result is what ports is that guy talking</font>

591
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,090
to and then the sum of the data that

592
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:41,000
that guy's talking to you and so we can

593
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,010
see this one system where most of the

594
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,500
day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being sent to which ports where</font>

595
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:48,110
is it communique most and so you know if

596
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,240
a if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect the system being</font>

597
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,059
compromised and we'd run this report and

598
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,270
we see you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real weird port on</font>

599
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:59,240
there you know three 1337 with a whole

600
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,500
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> day going out to that chances are</font>

601
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,240
pretty high that that system is

602
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,880
compromised and we have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

603
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,040
look into here yeah so the way it's set

604
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
up in our environment is each of these

605
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,610
different net flow sensors all

606
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,559
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world are all forwarding</font>

607
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,419
into a single system and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

608
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,290
system we're basically able to redirect

609
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,970
it into multiple feeds wherever we want

610
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,100
you can actually you know consumed in

611
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,260
multiple places we<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward that on to</font>

612
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">our tool and then our tool basically</font>

613
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,400
stores that NetFlow data in the database

614
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,710
and gives us the ability to report on

615
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as well as taking other pieces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

616
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:39,730
data and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as</font>

617
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:43,840
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the major limitation is going to</font>

618
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,450
be displaced so if you end database<font color="#E5E5E5"> size</font>

619
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,820
I guess so if you have lots of disk

620
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,800
space you can save a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data if you</font>

621
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,679
have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little disk space then you</font>

622
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,510
know not so much so so we don't use bro

623
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,640
at ni it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

624
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,260
at specifically with the security onion

625
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,510
stuff and the components bro that

626
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,330
integrate with that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be</font>

627
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing some of that stuff next year but</font>

628
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,010
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I have some more stuff</font>

629
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,220
coming up where I show it in tandem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

630
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:15,610
some of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> other tools so let's let's</font>

631
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,890
push forward on that yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of</font>

632
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,919
times you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll kind of filter it</font>

633
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,720
so we're only two guys will try and

634
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter it based on number of connections</font>

635
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,890
and by doing that well it will see

636
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,810
something you know it made one request

637
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,190
to a malware domain list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pee for me</font>

638
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,500
that's not something that I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

639
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what I'm going to be looking</font>

640
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,980
for is like multiple callbacks

641
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:38,380
commanding control servers things like

642
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,330
that so if I see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred connections</font>

643
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,830
to IP is listed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the malware domain</font>

644
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,300
list now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden I'm more</font>

645
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,460
interested and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a lot</font>

646
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,770
more attention to that so you kind of

647
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's 12 it's</font>

648
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a system that talk to something</font>

649
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it didn't get compromised you know I'm</font>

650
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">not gonna waste my time trying to track</font>

651
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,390
that down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I see repetitive if I</font>

652
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,100
see you know day after day if I see your

653
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,810
continual traffic or large volumes of

654
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,909
traffic those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that we're</font>

655
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and run the ground all</font>

656
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,720
right let's keep going and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

657
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,960
about performing in st. detection and

658
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,710
response with flow data so what I did is

659
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,060
is I took an actual situation at ni

660
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,250
where we had some alerts and you'll see

661
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:22,060
kind of what our daily alerts look like

662
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,260
with some data filtered out and I wanted

663
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,389
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of throw this out there cuz I</font>

664
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,360
want to see what you guys

665
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,700
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation so in our situation we</font>

666
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,179
saw this this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark net IP</font>

667
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,210
address report I've kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of filtered out</font>

668
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:39,180
the initial part but this is 75 27 and

669
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,030
we saw 641 connections to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> darknet IP</font>

670
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,160
space so my first question is who would

671
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,590
see this how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys would</font>

672
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,240
actually see this in your environment

673
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,370
yeah that's kind of what I thought so

674
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,990
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right I now</font>

675
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,679
have an IP address in my environment

676
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:57,960
that's talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dark net space that so</font>

677
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,710
this guy is either misconfigured at this

678
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,720
point or compromised probably cuz normal

679
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,450
IPS or normal systems on my network

680
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:10,320
aren't going to talk to blank space so

681
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:12,390
641 connections to dark net space so

682
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,899
what about this that's that same system

683
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,580
75 27 this is our simple fan report

684
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,200
which basically looks for scanning

685
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,179
activity it's a system that talks to

686
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,790
lots of other systems on the network and

687
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,250
now we know it's all it's already

688
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:30,330
talking to 600 + IP is in dark net space

689
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:33,330
but now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2866</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connections to just</font>

690
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,560
ain system right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all how</font>

691
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be able to detect</font>

692
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,639
this got few<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok awesome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a few</font>

693
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:46,200
can detect the scanning and then

694
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,790
secondly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a system here that at</font>

695
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,100
this point I'm thinking this is

696
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,899
compromised right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy he's doing</font>

697
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,459
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> skinnys talking to IPS they</font>

698
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,230
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be this guy's probably</font>

699
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,740
compromised but then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this a step</font>

700
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:00,450
further and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy too this is</font>

701
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,350
a search that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> created to look 40</font>

702
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,490
access and it's this one does tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

703
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,949
have some false positives because

704
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,770
basically I'm looking for is connections

705
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,400
from an internal system<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ports these</font>

706
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:16,110
guys right via UDP and this was just a

707
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,460
quick quick and dirty signature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

708
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,800
rolled out just based on some

709
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,870
observations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero access and said</font>

710
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right show me a system that's making</font>

711
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,949
these kind of connections so how many of

712
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys could do this kind of thing you</font>

713
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,330
can say pork-based you know show me

714
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything talking of that all right few</font>

715
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:37,560
more good so in this case that same

716
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,690
system we see 68 times was

717
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,260
making queries that match this pattern

718
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,150
so for me I know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system is</font>

719
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,820
compromised at this point scanning

720
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:51,150
activity talking IPS that don't even

721
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,510
exist and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero access search i'm</font>

722
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:58,470
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that this guy's compromised</font>

723
00:28:53,510 --> 00:29:00,629
so all right so assuming that you could

724
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,800
detect this you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font>

725
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys could actually answer these</font>

726
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,970
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we know most of</font>

727
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,740
the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room probably can't</font>

728
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,200
answer these questions yet and so this

729
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,360
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so important for us to be</font>

730
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,690
doing these level of security analytics

731
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,179
so question one was connecting this IP

732
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,510
address we create a simple pattern right

733
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,910
we say let's use a target we specify

734
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:26,310
this particular IP address show me any

735
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,740
case where this guy where anything is

736
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,600
connecting to this IP address and then

737
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,780
give me the count of who's talking to it

738
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I specify a time range well I</font>

739
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,889
know when this is doing it I run the

740
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,199
search pattern for that IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

741
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:42,810
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get back and I see five hundred</font>

742
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,780
thousand feet excuse me are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

743
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:47,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address and there's my results</font>

744
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,590
and so I can see the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it</font>

745
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,810
talks I can see the the source IP

746
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,580
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just kind of pulled out</font>

747
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,820
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say wow you know</font>

748
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is dejuan communication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no</font>

749
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea what dhawan is a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

750
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,840
stuff is like Amazon whatnots knew they

751
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,699
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that kind of stuff</font>

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then Facebook all right this guy</font>

753
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,060
likes facebook cool so question number

754
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,000
two what is this IP address connecting

755
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,889
to and so in this case we created a very

756
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar query in this case we just swap</font>

757
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:21,720
it we say ipv4 addresses target on the

758
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:24,030
source same kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at the</font>

759
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,680
destination the count now and with this

760
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,740
we write we get eight hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

761
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,350
forty-six thousand results and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

762
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">results so we see a few IPS at the top</font>

763
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:37,709
that it's talking to Amazon Web Services

764
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,960
some weird Farrell hosting I don't know

765
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,110
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> duong communications again</font>

766
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,330
this must be some back and forth

767
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">softlayer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> com not sure</font>

768
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:49,870
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one looked interesting post did</font>

769
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:53,140
dash by IHC dot are you that's weird

770
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:55,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to those guys before</font>

771
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,890
so we get we know who this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

772
00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:00,350
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so question 3</font>

773
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,750
do I have any alerts associated with the

774
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,269
IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address so now I'll look at my other</font>

775
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,880
systems and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pulling data here so</font>

776
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:10,279
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is I said all right run me a</font>

777
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,360
search for any alerts from my fire Isis

778
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:16,250
don't run me a search from my IPS system

779
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,439
and then tell me you know if you find

780
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,059
anything in this case my answer was no

781
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,230
we don't have any alerts from those guys

782
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:25,879
cool and then question<font color="#E5E5E5"> four is there any</font>

783
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,929
significant mode at a loss from that

784
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if stuff's going up so I</font>

785
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,690
create that pattern I look for this

786
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,630
specific IP address I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all</font>

787
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:40,639
external connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to c country</font>

788
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,549
code destination port and then some of

789
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,918
the the bite sent and I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

790
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:48,350
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see this particular</font>

791
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,200
system I can see all the destinations I

792
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,449
can see what ports it's talking to and I

793
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,039
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data so in this</font>

794
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,230
case here's the list here's everything

795
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,289
that's talking to you and how much it's

796
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:05,500
sending and you know 18 Meg's to some

797
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:10,639
random IP address and was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Latvia</font>

798
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:12,710
that doesn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> good to me so we're by</font>

799
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,918
using this this tool this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

800
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:20,389
framework by doing analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of net flow</font>

801
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,500
by doing analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the devices our</font>

802
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:23,689
network kind of pulling it all together

803
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,909
we're able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer these questions and</font>

804
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,370
these are very important questions as

805
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:31,309
screw professionals for us to be asking

806
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and being able to be answered I wanted</font>

807
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make a quick note of the collective</font>

808
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:38,510
intelligence frame so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cyber</font>

809
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,549
threat intelligence management system

810
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to combine no malicious</font>

811
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,090
threaten formation from all sorts of

812
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">different sources they use information</font>

813
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:51,830
for identification detection and

814
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,409
mitigation and this is a free open

815
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,789
source and basically you can download

816
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,470
this zip guy

817
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,119
you can collect data from all these

818
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,919
different places you can collect it from

819
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,139
public sources you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can collect it from</font>

820
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,690
private sources and then you can use it

821
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:07,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">to push data to other systems so you can</font>

822
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually create your own collective</font>

823
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:10,729
intelligence framework and actually

824
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,399
harness data from all these other

825
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:18,049
sources and then use that to do your

826
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:20,330
report as well so quickly we're running

827
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:23,830
short on time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

828
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:26,960
some next steps here so in this case I

829
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can ask ourselves are their</font>

830
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,489
alerts associated with this host on my

831
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,869
IPS or other monitoring devices in this

832
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:35,119
case we've answered the question the

833
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:38,299
answer is no we can also do things like

834
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:41,478
reputation data so in our tool we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

835
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:45,049
queries for wap sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> josh Amish lab zaten</font>

836
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:48,019
very very active with modsecurity

837
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:50,119
created this service and it's free where

838
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:52,159
you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> in I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> query for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP</font>

839
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:54,349
address it comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tells you</font>

840
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,749
where it's located and you know work

841
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:58,519
like work what latitude and longitude it

842
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:00,649
has and it'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if there's spam</font>

843
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,749
associated with in things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

844
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:05,959
it gives you some valuable reputation

845
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:07,489
based data on that the mcafee threat

846
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,490
intelligence day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually interesting</font>

847
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:12,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to same kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you send it an IP</font>

848
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,989
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it says here's the email</font>

849
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,418
reputation here's the web reputation so

850
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:19,638
for this particular IP address this

851
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:22,190
stuff is kind of coming up cloudy to me

852
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,710
this looks like you know nobody else has

853
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,809
really seen this IP address before you

854
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:31,609

apt but ya know and for this particular

856
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:35,960
one which wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that we're</font>

857
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:38,299
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at earlier this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is a</font>

858
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,710
false positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my my opinion because</font>

859
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:45,139
you know we don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

860
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:47,389
reputation stuff there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what else for</font>

861
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:49,700
real-time decision making you can ask

862
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions like should I accept packets</font>

863
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,158
from random IPS and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

864
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,989
this tool is more after the fact but

865
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get with this</font>

866
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:01,629
kind of data we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to take</font>

867
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,940
our reputation data all right

868
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,170
data vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> death or asset data</font>

869
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,059
and any information about trust

870
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,460
boundaries and bubble that up to be able

871
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:11,650
to say yes I should accept data from

872
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,990
that guy I trust him it's from a known

873
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,109
source it's from a source that hasn't

874
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,450
attacked me before or no that guy is

875
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:21,819
being shown on my IPS alerts I see

876
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,680
alerts from my fire I that system is bad

877
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,049
don't trust any data from there that's

878
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,700
where we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know</font>

879
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,619
show I allow some person to download a

880
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,328
file well what's the day of

881
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:33,819
classification that file what's the

882
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,589
reputation data the authentication day

883
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:37,599
authorization trust boundaries things

884
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,828
like that so we need to figure out where

885
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,079
the right questions that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

886
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:43,480
asking where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that data set and then</font>

887
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,759
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to combine that data into you know a</font>

888
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,720
query that returns meaningful results

889
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:51,490
for us in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking action so we</font>

890
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,799
can do all sorts of things when we have

891
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,390
these results we could block an IP

892
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:58,660
address with some sort of firewall or

893
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:00,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">IPS cisco we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get back a list of things</font>

894
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,680
that they're doing wrong send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that off</font>

895
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,500
to our IPS or a firewall and just say

896
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,960
let's block them we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> create waffles</font>

897
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,490
based on attack data and if we you know

898
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,920
seeing certain types of attacks we can

899
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:14,109
feed that day back in we could ban a

900
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,150
system from communicating our network we

901
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:18,038
could require some sort of additional

902
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,420
authentication and you know say okay

903
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,160
well you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some</font>

904
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,660
suspicious stuff our networks and now

905
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,390
let's do multi-factor authentication

906
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,029
require you to you enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pin off your</font>

907
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:31,359
phone or something you know some might

908
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:33,849
even say attack back this was the former

909
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,950
CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> of HP gary said the bad guys are so</font>

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:44,410
fighting back by hacking the hacker

914
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,960
hacker becomes a hacky obviously some

legal challenges here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not going to</font>

00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:53,410
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that</font>

918
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:56,200
other people are so to kind of summarize

919
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,730
this lot of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think are</font>

920
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,799
suffering<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a lack of visibility into</font>

critical security threats<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that</font>

922
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:03,630
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the lack of hands when we ask</font>

923
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,609
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions kind of sums that up</font>

scuri<font color="#E5E5E5"> alex allow us to see and react to</font>

925
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:11,200
those threats the ideal tools are ones

926
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,930
that have both the provider and consumer

927
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,220
capability

928
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,620
because they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of air mix</font>

929
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,390
intermingle we want to combine tooled

930
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,830
attics together because that gives us

931
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,350
the context that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can use to make</font>

932
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">informed decisions and then in our case</font>

933
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,970
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> network flow days is really the</font>

934
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,589
glue that ties all these different

935
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,450
events together and helps us kill

936
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">illustrate the attack progression so</font>

937
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,689
we're that's how we're able to do that

938
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,700
do we see any<font color="#CCCCCC"> future in terms of being</font>

939
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,980
able to automate you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

940
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,259
of detection to the point of responding

941
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,140
to this and my answer is yes I think

942
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:45,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're we're kind of</font>

943
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,299
pushing the the the limit on in terms of

944
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,250
what the tool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology is able to</font>

945
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,810
do but as an industry that's where we're

946
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,460
moving we want to be able to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

947
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,049
questions from real time we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

948
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,090
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer these questions in real</font>

949
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,160
time we want to be able to act in real

950
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,410
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so absolutely this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we need</font>

951
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go as an industry if our tools aren't</font>

952
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,600
taking us there then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to figure</font>

953
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,910
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to get there so yes and no we</font>

954
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have full pcap through this tool</font>

955
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:14,870
it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in terms of</font>

956
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:17,299
searchability I we are able to pretty

957
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:20,839
much run any search that we want to to

958
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,790
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this look suspicious the problem</font>

959
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've had by not having pcap is</font>

960
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,800
moving beyond that oftentimes you'll get

961
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,060
to a point where you're like you know

962
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,490
you run all these queries and you're

963
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,340
like damn that system looks infected but

964
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,080
you know I want to know what what data

965
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,270
it's sending you I see data exfiltration

966
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,770
you know what was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file name what was</font>

967
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data within that file and</font>

968
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,500
unfortunately it's very difficult to get

969
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that so if I if I had my druthers I</font>

970
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,100
absolutely would like to have the pcap

971
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:51,020
day as well which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we're looking</font>

972
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,270
at things like security onion to be able

973
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually capture some of that data in</font>

974
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the flow data and things</font>

975
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,100
like that our goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get more and</font>

976
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,020
more granular<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get this closer and</font>

977
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,520
closer real time but we are still in

978
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,070
addition to these<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are kind of</font>

979
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,450
supplementary we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all the</font>

980
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,550
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard stuff that you would be</font>

981
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,109
doing so we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> antivirus</font>

982
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,270
stuff we're looking at malware detection

983
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:13,220
as we're looking at IPS firewall logs

984
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,080
you know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other stuff everybody</font>

985
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">else is doing this is just stuff that</font>

986
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,529
we're doing in addition and the

987
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,320
unfortunate thing is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that other</font>

988
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,390
stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a sieve so when that</font>

989
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,410
stuff kind of you know let's stuff

990
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,440
leaked through

991
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:29,870
this is where we're catching up<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow</font>

992
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,780
is very small it's very simple it's easy

993
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:34,069
to run searches on and it's quick so so

994
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,840
if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get quick and dirty</font>

995
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,060
that is a great way to do it if you're

996
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to get deep into the weeds it is</font>

997
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,350
not I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all know that that</font>

998
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,600
antivirus went signature-based you know

999
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,160

1000
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,880
the speed debates you<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard my my</font>

1001
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,480
response to that yesterday yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1002
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,250

1003
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,220
regardless what<font color="#E5E5E5"> new Christine tries to</font>

1004
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,110
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we in a speed debate you know we</font>

1005
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,939

1006
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:05,420
analysis in order to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1007

1009
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,540
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot they've done much</font>

1010
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,220
