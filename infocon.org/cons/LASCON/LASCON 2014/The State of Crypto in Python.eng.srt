00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,250
my name is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring I'm the cloud</font>

2
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,869
security actually I'm adjusting security

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,490
product manager at Rackspace down so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

4
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,349
own all customer base security products

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,299
or for all Rackspace customers that's

6
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:31,300
public and private and cloud and

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,110
dedicated these days today we're gonna

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,780
be talking about the state of

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,699
cryptography and Python or if we like to

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,949
term it a story about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who make</font>

11
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:39,970
bad life decisions because for those of

12
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,440
you who have worked on Krypto in the

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,269
past it can be quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult I</font>

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
normally I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CO speaker Paul Kerr</font>

15
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:47,320
who is enjoying himself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font>

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ignoring me at the moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font>

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to proceed without him so</font>

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,539
basically how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we kind of get into the</font>

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:01:00,219
space for us so I started a project

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:06,160
about a year and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

21
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:09,270
sounds like Kevin in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other room it</font>

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,160
does sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Kevin um anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sue</font>

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,350
started a project in OpenStack that we

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,789
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> bbqing and basically the reason</font>

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,350
we started Barbican is we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

26
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,640
OpenStack there were a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,280
ovid stack that wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer</font>

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,250
encryption right so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,470
familiar with OpenStack first okay so

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,450
about half so<font color="#E5E5E5"> open stacks an open source</font>

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,009
free cloud platform right so it allows

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,840
you to kind of build your own clouds

33
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,490
mostly aimed at building private clouds

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,329
for folks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> rackspace's public cloud</font>

35
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,949
also runs on top of OpenStack so we were

36
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:40,600
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you've got cloud servers for</font>

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,680
compute you've got storage and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,350
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> other aspects that you would</font>

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,869
expect in a cloud like AWS and a lot of

40
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers one or a lot of developers and</font>

41
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,469
product manager stuff want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

42
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">offer scription and so to be able offer</font>

43
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,199
encryption they needed some kind of key

44
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,520
management platforms right so we looked

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,110
at all of these these guys that wanted

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer encryption and we looked it you</font>

47
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,780
know here's their diagrams and all this

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,039
they're all super complicated and

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,390
detailed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom right-hand corner</font>

50
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,700
there was just this little box that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

51
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,110
team manager right and we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

52
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask them hey what's the key manager and</font>

53
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,070
they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like what we'll figure that</font>

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,449
out okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hard</font>

55
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,700
part so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go figure that out</font>

56
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">for you at the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time Rackspace was</font>

57
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,929
looking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> revamp an existing offering</font>

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we offer to customers around ssl</font>

59
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">certificate so we sell us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sell</font>

60
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,070
against customers it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

61
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,989
business for us but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,970
customers need a and so we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

63
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:26,680
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for them and we wanted to</font>

64
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,109
revamp that both to offer some new

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,050
products offered cloud customers and

66
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,310
there was some

67
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,680
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more secure from a</font>

68
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,080
internal perspective and more isolated

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,720
and some of the types of things and so

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">barbican was kind of bored right so as</font>

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,540
we were looking at building Barbicane if

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,700
you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenStack it needs</font>

73
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,799
to be built<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Python so as we started</font>

74
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at what what we were going to</font>

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,440
need in Python to do this obviously

76
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to do a lot of</font>

77
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,359
cryptographic operations and so we

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,920
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go investigate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,340
where's crypto on Python right how

80
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,530
capable are we of doing all of this work

81
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,020
you are a tease montage and then we

82
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,930
ended up with this right so what we

83
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,150
wanted out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

84
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,980
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the algorithm support</font>

85
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,930
that we wanted barbican needs to operate

86
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,519
as an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source product across a wide</font>

87
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,170
variety of platforms for wide variety of

88
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,300
customers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a wide variety of</font>

89
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,859
needs right so we couldn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

90
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,300
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> prescriptive as to what algorithm</font>

91
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,070
choices they wanted some people want to

92
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">use some pretty fancy stuff from DJ B</font>

93
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,549
and a few other things and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

94
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,960
nice some people are under phipps

95
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,310
requirements and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

96
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,780
list of the things that they're allowed

97
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,610
to use and they can't use anything else

98
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,470
so we wanted to be able to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

99
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,930
off those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standard operations</font>

100
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,670
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of wider operations we</font>

101
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,260
wanted to be open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> rackspace big</font>

102
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,910
open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan obviously OpenStack is</font>

103
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,140
open source as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so it had to be</font>

104
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,730
something that we distributed without

105
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,559
too much pain from a licensing

106
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,570
perspective we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be</font>

107
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,890
maintained and tested so we wanted it to

108
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> updated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the last</font>

109
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,820
five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> we maintained by more than</font>

110
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,590
one guy in his spare time and actually

111
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,010
have some tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of prove that it</font>

112
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,180
was working and functional and finally

113
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,630
we want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it supported</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

114
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,250
wide variety of pythons and so we have a

115
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,180
lot of folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> run pi PI impact we</font>

116
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,520
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the core contributors that</font>

117
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">work for rackspace we want to be able to</font>

118
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,350
run in<font color="#E5E5E5"> PI 2 and PI 3 and all of the</font>

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,489
various different environments depending

120
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,040
on what customers wanted to be able to

121
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:17,209
do and so we wanted to be able to kind

122
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,380
of find that stuff so fundamentally what

123
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,269
we're looking for is a library<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

124
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,310
could trust to kind of meet all of these

125
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,210
needs for us right so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we're</font>

126
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,660
gonna spend a lot of time talking about

127
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">today is is C right and it's an</font>

128
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,050
unfortunate side effect so as a quick

129
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,750
rounder for this view they haven't dealt

130
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,640
too much in<font color="#CCCCCC"> python and soothe and crypto</font>

131
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,380
in general at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day almost</font>

132
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,930
all actual cryptographic primitives are

133
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,770
implemented in see there is now a big

134
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,300
big push to implement a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

135
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Adam Langley and his team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at Google did</font>

136
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,990
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on that very very cool</font>

137
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,949
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> edem at even Adam is not really</font>

138
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,120
recommending that people use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

139
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,550
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think he's</font>

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,919
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little overly modest there but</font>

141
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,030
I'm anyway so from an implementation

142
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,639
standpoint there's a lot of very

143
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,599
important things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to have</font>

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,720

145
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:07,620
algorithms correctly and you can't make

recover key material or data material

152
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,590

153
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,448

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,609
really strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation or really</font>

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,199
of these types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so those</font>

158
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,020
kind of constant algorithms matter a lot

159
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,729
all good crypto is already written in C

160
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,310
and writing good crypto is really really

161
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,960
really difficult and so we didn't want

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so you're pretty much always</font>

basically we ended up with this list of

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at all these</font>

196
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,029

198
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,759
at those we've got this list of

obviously is kind of happening at the

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:53,909
hill NSS is another big option so NSS

202

was the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> mozilla our original</font>

and then it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla basically made</font>

is surprisingly popular was one of the

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,560
big surprises for us in this was how

217
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,300
popular lib g crypt actually was and it

218
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,530
actually comes down to a licensing fight

219
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,540
between Debbie and then the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

220
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,919
world and so a lot of Debian packages

221
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,410
use lib decrypt because they don't like

222
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,090
open SSL and then finally we added

223
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,710
Liberty SSL because it's the the new

ripping out large chunks of it comments

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,010
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add that one and we kind of</font>

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
graded them across how how open source

229
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,130
are they right whether they're open

230

source or not cross-platform whether

231
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,790
they're maintained or not how ubiquitous

232
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,929
are they how many machines will actually

233
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,330
have them without<font color="#CCCCCC"> us having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

through hoops to get them installed

whether they supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular case and they're</font>

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a lot of good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff right openssl</font>

283
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,470
they're also doing some stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

284
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,210
it impossible for most people to use it

285
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,820
it's getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

platform that's great one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

287
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,970
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did is they went they ripped out</font>

288
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,380
all of the custom ASM code that openssl

289
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,640
had written so libris is all this points

290
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,970
about twenty to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty percent slower</font>

291
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,620
than openssl at most major cryptographic

292
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,820
functions that basically renders it

293
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,370
useless for most actual production

294
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,050
scenarios it's getting better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll</font>

295
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,730
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their argument is</font>

296
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,990
that over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be able to to</font>

297
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,610
tune it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> various other ways that'll</font>

298
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,710
get that feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that they are</font>

299
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful in that because you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

300
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,220
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good maintained c library version</font>

301
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,110
of up in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell would be really great</font>

302
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,160
for everybody so so we're hoping on that

303
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,600
one we'll see how it goes and then

304
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously since they ripped out all the</font>

305
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,480
fifth stuff they lost their cribs

306
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,500
compliance to be honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't care</font>

307
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this anymore i think it's</font>

308
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,770
basically a waste of effort to worry

309
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,500
about it but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some companies</font>

310
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,520
don't have an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

311
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,530
not going to read this at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

312
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,030
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover for it so now that we know</font>

313
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,020
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the c library state was it was</font>

314
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,850
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look at how those see</font>

315
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,710
libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> map to python cool finally get</font>

316
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,420
to where we want to be so again we

317
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked through a whole set of libraries</font>

318
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,069
and we kind of put them by okay well

319
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,900
what's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end are they using right</font>

320
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,910
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care about that whether they</font>

321
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain or not what versions of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font>

322
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,000
they support whether they've ever been

323
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,280
reviewed by anybody from a cryptographic

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,770
standpoint and then just kind of general

325
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,470
completeness so we looked at em to these

326
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,650
are all the kind of more famous once we

327
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,270
look to em to crypto which uses openssl

328
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,590
it been dead for a really really really

329
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,060
long time somebody picked it up recently

330
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:57,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I got a building again but they're not</font>

332
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,310
of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common cryptographic library</font>

333
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,220
outside of cryptography which we'll talk

334
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a little bit pi crypto had uses</font>

335
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,720
bespoke see on the back end they wrote

their own see back end that see back end

337
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,420
has never been looked at by anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

338
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,490
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the most popular in</font>

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python it has never been reviewed from a</font>

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,590
security perspective not saying it's

341
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,010
good or bad just said it has

342
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,230
been done they don't support pi PI right

343
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,370
now there were some things that they

344
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,320
didn't support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last time we looked</font>

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,000
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like authenticated ciphers and</font>

349
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,660
pretty good used to just talk to openssl

350
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,760
directly it sits on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA grassina</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">python NSS fine but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really thin</font>

wrapper around NSS and then botan like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

353
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,699
said was great but getting it installing

354
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,020
installed was you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pick</font>

355
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,060
install it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you have to hand build</font>

356
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,020
all this crap as a real pig and so we

357
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,089
kind of stay away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one I think</font>

358
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main piece that came with most of</font>

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">these is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that even if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were in a</font>

360
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,750
relatively good<font color="#CCCCCC"> state they're just been</font>

361
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,430
Python wrappers around the sea so to be

362
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,380
able to use the pipe on you had to

363
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand the seed library it wasn't</font>

364
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,950
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

365
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,110
all those seed libraries have really

366
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharp edges so if you really</font>

367
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what you're doing right which</font>

368
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,750
no one knows what they're doing when

369
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're talking about openssl right you</font>

370
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,590
will screw it up right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even those of</font>

371
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,510
us spend like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cryptography guys we</font>

372
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,430
spend weeks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> months like digging</font>

373
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,340
through openssl code and we still

374
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,870
everyday wear it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense right</font>

375
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,000
it's really hard to understand how those

376
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,290
see libraries work and so expecting

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python people to be able to just use a</font>

378
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python lib that really just wraps the C</font>

379
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,000
library just means that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

380
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,060
understand openssl which most people

381
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,020
don't and so it brings so at the end of

382
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we came up with the fact that</font>

383
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:45,360
really what we needed was a native

384
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python library right and when I mean</font>

385
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,490
native I don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were going to</font>

386
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,310
write all the cryptographic code in

387
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,560
Python I mean that the library<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to</font>

388
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,770
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python code right not like C</font>

389
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,500
code and so we wrote cryptography and so

390
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,400
the goal of her photography<font color="#CCCCCC"> was with</font>

391
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,320
support from modern algorithm so we

392
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,050
wanted to be able to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> psg</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CM and</font>

393
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,630
some of the new age kid gaps and various

394
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,459
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we love it out there</font>

395
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,170
we want to be able to improve the

396
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,760
ability to debug and test the actual

397
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,890
libraries almost all of the sea<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

398
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,319
Python libraries we saw had almost no

399
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,040
testing the Python libraries obviously

400
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,260
we're better but see basically had none

401
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,110
with the exception<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bhutan and the</font>

402
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,870
Python libraries were spotty at best we

403
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,800
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sane secure API</font>

404
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,930
basically with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea if you use the</font>

405
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">API you will it will do the right thing</font>

406
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,769
by default and you have to work

407
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,939
hard to do the stupid thing right and

408
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,980
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of basically take the sharp edges</font>

409
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:39,420
away there are ways to delve underneath

410
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,709
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you really know what</font>

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and you know that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

413
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,300
the standard way of using all of it is

414
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,040
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use it and things work the</font>

way that you expect them to we want to

libraries and the Python libraries were

420
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:59,100
maintained by one guy in their spare

421
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,399
time and so the the level of movement on

422
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,629
these libraries was very very very slow

423
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,279
we wanted to encourage the use of kind

424
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:06,749
of the the newer type of algorithms get

425
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
away from some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that people</font>

426
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,959
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> use by default basically we</font>

427
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,329
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build cryptography for humans</font>

428
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,359
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we were we were time and</font>

429
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,998
aiming at so we started the PI CA the

430
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,959
Python cryptographic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Authority just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

431
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,879
of the organization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrap it</font>

432
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">around if you go to github / pi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CA has</font>

433
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,529
all the stuff for that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

434
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,850
so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we start a cryptography a</font>

435
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,079
whole group of people started a kind of

436
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,279
coalesce around people who were

437
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,739
interested in security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cryptography</font>

438
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,420
and also we're interested in Python and

439
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,579
so those were guys who maintained by

440
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,189
openssl and I to maintain pineapple and

441
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys who were service identity which</font>

442
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:44,040
is about hos main verification and the

443
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:44,939
bcrypt stuff like library and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pluto say</font>

444
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,259
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that were like</font>

445
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,519
maintaining all these things is onesies

446
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:49,199
and twosies started to kind of bring

447
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,730
them in and now we had this big group of

448
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that understood Python and</font>

449
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,819
cryptography and now we have six or

450
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,079
seven projects but at least now there's

451
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than one person who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can review</font>

452
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,508
patches and landing so we've actually

453
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,430
got a reasonable amount of stuff in

454
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:01,199
there it's made things move a lot faster

455
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,529
for all these projects that's pretty

456
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice so the way we structured the</font>

457
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,850
library is kind of we split it into

458
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,430
three parts we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have what we call a</font>

459
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,680
bindings layer this is the so we chose

460
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the pipe I group</font>

461
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,388
that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to bind to see right and</font>

462
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:20,579
that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to use we can support all</font>

463
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,929
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pythons so it's pi PI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> python to you</font>

464
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 compliant all that kind of</font>

465
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,829
stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice and so we have</font>

466
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,529
a binding layer and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very much</font>

467
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,609
like see in Python that's it so like you

468
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,499
can literally crash the Python

469
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,240
interpreter with like you know use after

470
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,670
free bugs you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the binding</font>

471
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,439
layer this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stuff that most people</font>

472
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,378
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably never touch but other</font>

473
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:42,120
libraries use that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty not six</font>

474
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:45,089
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so PI openssl that used to</font>

475
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,430
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to openssl now talks to</font>

476
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:47,020
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

477
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,790
layer and the binding layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> toxic</font>

478
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,980
openssl and that gave them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability</font>

479
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,829
to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python 3 and PI pi which they</font>

480
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,510
weren't able to do in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> right pi</font>

481
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,040
crypto is actually going to port on top

482
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,290
of cryptography relatively soon here

483
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">param eco the next major version of</font>

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,260
cryptography pretty soon here so

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,550
cryptography<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zack chua</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee were I've got</font>

487
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,649
a slide later that has some download

488
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,699
counts but it's it's getting very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

489
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,310
popular I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the top 200</font>

490
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">python packages now anyway so you got</font>

491
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,680
this basic bindings layer on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

492
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,149
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what we call the hazmat layer</font>

493
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,890
and the reason it's called a hazmat

494
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,310
layer is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

495
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,510
doing do not go in here right so these

496
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,300
are higher level cryptographic

497
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,620
primitives it's not sea level right but

498
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,599
these are still enough that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

499
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,649
know how to correctly put them in place

500
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,300
right if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to design</font>

501
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,310
the algorithm or design the construct

502
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,779
you will screw it up right so they're

503
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,790
still very sharp edges and the hazmat

504
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:39,100
layer most developers should never touch

505
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a but it is an abstract layer</font>

506
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,700
that sits on top of bindings so a big

507
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,560
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the library will talk about is</font>

508
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,020
we support multiple backends so it's not

509
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">just openssl right and so the hazmat</font>

510
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,290
layer gives you kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generic layer</font>

511
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,630
that you can say okay well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font>

512
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this AES cipher and that ASI fer</font>

513
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,810
will use a different binding layer to

514
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,430
map to whatever c library you happen to

515
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,719
be using then finally the thing that we

516
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,849
hope most people will use is the recipe

517
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,560
layer and recipes are more what you

518
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,790
would expect as a developer right if you

519
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to encrypt something there's a box</font>

520
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,809
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nun box call and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

521
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,250
it's very very simple it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar</font>

522
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,869
to kind of if you've ever used pineapple

523
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,579
it's very similar to some of those types

524
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:14,889
of things and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is it's a very</font>

525
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,448
high level API<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's aimed specifically</font>

526
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,069
at solving problems that developers have

527
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,140
I want to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

528
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,490
you know hash this or sign this or

529
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,050
whatever it is without<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to worry</font>

530
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,189
about what algorithms you have to choose

531
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,780
or what you know worrying about

532
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,280
algorithmic agility or how you generate

533
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,569
the keys or how you store the keys or

534
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,860
how you put the data together and where

535
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,330
you sign before you encrypt or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

536
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,159
before you sign you have to do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

537
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,960
that stuff right so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

538
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just say I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and it's</font>

539
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of opinionated admit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't for</font>

540
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:41,559
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so right now we support open a</font>

541
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,200
cell that's the primary back-end on all

542
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,580
of our all of our supported platforms we

543
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,020
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a back-end for common crypto</font>

544
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,428
so if you're using it on a mac that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

545
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,629
actually use common crypto you want to

546
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:54,100
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way we also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some work</font>

547
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,419
that's being done it's not done yet on

548
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile again that allows you to use</font>

549
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:58,279
multiple back ends at the same time and

550
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:59,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">where that</font>

551
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">becomes really valuable as if you want</font>

552
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,019
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like lemon is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl</font>

553
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:06,200
but i also want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use s correct well s</font>

554
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:07,519
crip doesn't exist in openssl so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

555
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,989
actually to see libraries that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

556
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bind at the same time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">call this and i want to call this and</font>

559
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,419
underneath the<font color="#E5E5E5"> covers we figure out how</font>

560
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:17,389
to make all that stuff bind together for

561
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:19,249
you and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at NEC backend</font>

562
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,799
being included a bunch of and they're

563
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:23,239
coming over we'll see how that goes

564
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,139
they're not too hard to bring in but

565
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:30,289
take some time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big goal for us was</font>

566
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,820
about testing and so we spend an

567
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:34,249
enormous amount of time and energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

568
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">rackspace grants a normal amount of</font>

569
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:37,639
money to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project's be able to run</font>

570
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,529
our testing infrastructure so that we

571
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:42,228
could test this library across a wide

572
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,089
variety of platforms and open SSL

573
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:47,299
versions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> os is and all kinds of</font>

574
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:50,059
stuff so you can't really read this but

575
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:52,940
so right now well as a con which was

576
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:56,839
April we run about 70 horses in tests

577
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,119
for each run there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 78 runs per build</font>

578
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,178
so every time that you put in a single

579
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,408
PR there are 78 like elements in that

580
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:05,509
build matrix and each one of those

581
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,029
elements is running about 74,000 tests

582
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:11,259
we run about 15 builds per day right now

583
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:14,389
it can go up or<font color="#E5E5E5"> down just about average</font>

584
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:17,479
so for each build we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 5.8</font>

585
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:19,758
million tests and then that works out to

586
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:22,879
about a little over 575 million tests

587
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:26,450
per week obviously so a lot of these

588
00:19:22,879 --> 00:19:28,189
tests are based on information that NIST

589
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,349
and various other groups publish that

590
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,149
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if you take this this key</font>

591
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:33,859
and this initialization vector and you

592
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:35,748
run this algorithm this number of times

593
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,039
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> result right and they have</font>

594
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:38,089
millions of those and so you pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

595
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,789
all in and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> check them every single</font>

596
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:42,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">time right and we run these across</font>

597
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:43,729
basically how we get this matrix is at

598
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,509
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run this</font>

599
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:46,609
across a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

600
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:48,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">versions of openssl a whole bunch of</font>

601
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:49,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> versions of Linux whole bunch</font>

602
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">of diversions of windows whole bunch of</font>

603
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,179
version of OSX right and so it's all

604
00:19:51,979 --> 00:19:54,589
these platforms and they start to

605
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,239
multiply and you get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ugly</font>

606
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:57,529
combinatorial problem where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

607
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:59,029
with lots and lots of stuff right so

608
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,679
Yosemite coming out means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

609
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:02,599
number is already gone significantly

610
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,279
higher because we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go build a</font>

611
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:05,570
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new builders on top of our dsx</font>

612
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:09,649
infrastructure to build all this stuff

613
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,779
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably about 30 VMS or so</font>

614
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,229
that are involved on the jenkins side

615
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,620
and then we

616
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:17,059
Travis to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff as well do</font>

617
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,030
45 documentation builds but anyway

618
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Travis gives us a lot of resources at</font>

619
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,340
this point we've kind of broken their

620
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,870
infrastructure so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

621
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to move off of it takes like 18</font>

622
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,090
hours now to run our builds off of

623
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,280
Travis which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of not okay anymore</font>

624
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,000
but they've been super cool and donated

625
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,980
an enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> press that's pretty awesome</font>

626
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,630
so lots of folks here I'm out scanner as

627
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,309
a core contributor for Python core

628

contributor for pi PI or contribute for

631
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:48,559
Paul's written the vast majority he

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,090
works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> rackspace with all of us he's</font>

633
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,270
busy hanging out San Francisco and being

634
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,830
a hipster David reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple other</font>

635
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,168
folks out stapleton a lot of these guys

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rackers a lot of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> art and then</font>

637
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,559
there's about 50 contributors all

638
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">together some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of which are pretty</font>

639
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,720
because already<font color="#E5E5E5"> active so we also have a</font>

640
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,030
whole group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hang out in</font>

641
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,200
the channel now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> help us with</font>

642
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,030
various things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily</font>

643
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,770
write code but our actual cryptographers

644
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,240
for example so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> matt green will pop</font>

645
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,650
in every once<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while and help us with a</font>

646
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,059
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's like oh hey like is</font>

647
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,150
this construct the right way to build

648
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:21,460
this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual cryptographic questions</font>

649
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:27,010
as opposed to implementation questions

650
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:30,250
it's the Sun time so you use

651
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:35,179
cryptography friendly what we support is

652
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:37,160
ciphers that you could want like you

653
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,380
know actually

654
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,640
call the the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would want</font>

655
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,640
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much there from a symmetric</font>

656
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,100
well I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting interference from the</font>

657
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:53,220
next group staff and then all hashing

658
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,870
you would want to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDFs the PDFs are</font>

659
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:02,309
all in there yeah thank you basically

660
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:03,239
are pretty much entirely there that's

661
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,770
right support is something we're still

662
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,630
actively working on so like there's a

663
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,250
lot of support there there's a lot of

664
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,809
functionality right now there's still

665
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,550
some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> around importing various key</font>

666
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,139
types and translating those key types

667
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,510
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> back ends that's kind of active</font>

668
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,760
work that's going on now from a

669
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recipes perspective we we</font>

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,570
support something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fernet just</font>

671
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,220
created by the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Heroku it's a</font>

672
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,020
nice boxed format so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

673
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,220
encrypt a piece of data customers email

address or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't want</font>

675
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,390
sitting unencrypted you basically just

676
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,070
kind of tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> fernet give me a key going</font>

677
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">crypt this data with this key you go</font>

678
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,610
store the key somewhere and then you

679
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dump this block that it gives you</font>

680
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,639
back into your database and you don't

681
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,929
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry that underneath and covers</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">burnett is doing a lot of stuff for you</font>

683
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,470
right it's actually inside this block

684
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,970
it's noting what algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's using</font>

685
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,929
and what work factors it's using and all

686
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,190
these other types and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those things</font>

687
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,360
can be tweaked and changed underneath

688
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,800
the covers and it has algorithmic

689
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,030
agility and work agility and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

690
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,620
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things but you as a</font>

691
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,629
developer to worry about any of that you

692
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,709
just tell it just box this up right

693
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,860
and it'll do it for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't</font>

694
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about pretty nice so</font>

695
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,169
anyway so you've got kind of big stuff

696
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,800
yeah we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> released point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 that has a</font>

697
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,080
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more around asymmetric stuff x509 is</font>

698
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,610
currently under major development and so

699
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
we should see a good majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> XY 1</font>

700
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,750
i'll and in point seventy should be

701
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,760
hopefully here in the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

702
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,250
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a little about downstream</font>

703
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,840

704
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,940
on us so if you're using pi openssl

705
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,250
you're already using cryptography pi

706

crypto is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> prototype phase it'll</font>

707
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,080
probably be moved over by the end of the

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,520
over as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so pretty soon this is</font>

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much the ballgame or actual</font>

717
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,129
so once these libraries move over pretty

<font color="#E5E5E5">much every major cryptographic library</font>

719
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,730
will so

720
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:56,100
oh these are kind of download<font color="#E5E5E5"> pout so</font>

721
00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:00,049
you can see like here's for 250 thousand

722
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:02,279
a month it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a week before Sarah</font>

723

we're downloading I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> our test</font>

724
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,330
infrastructure downloads it a lot too so

725
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:10,350
it could just be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> us that but you</font>

726
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:11,489
know internet points so say we had some

727
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,580
questions lots when we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

728
00:24:11,489 --> 00:24:18,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the licensing structure the</font>

729
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,340
project was licensed under apache2 there

730
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,779
was some concern in a couple of cases

731
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it couldn't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easily distributed</font>

732
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,470
in certain scenarios a big goal for all

00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,508
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us working on cryptography is that</font>

734
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,009
you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anywhere anytime no</font>

735
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,480
matter what restrictions you are under

736
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,159
from your company or whatever it happens

737
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,139
to be good crypto should be available

738
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">for everyone so we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to go</font>

739
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:41,039
back and also licensed it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

740
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,149
that's in process now we've had some

741
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have complained about the</font>

742
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,939
fact that we're doing that I don't know

743
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,769
but to say this is guy named van

it gets sued and all that kind of stuff

748
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,359
he works for rackspace we just dump this

749
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,350
in his lap and he told us what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so</font>

750
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,480
if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it you should just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

751
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,100
yell at him he's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

should definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes much as possible</font>

753
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,709
we like to give this presentation and

754
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,449
not tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it and</font>

755
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,220

759
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:15,720
original goals right did we get what we

760
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:17,549
wanted right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> multipack end and open</font>

761
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,929
to sell it'll left us to cover all of

762
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the major algorithms that anybody would</font>

763
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,809
want and multi back and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

764
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,210
extend that in whatever direction we

765
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:26,340
want we're not limited by a single c

766
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,169
library having to have everything right

767
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,519
that being said multi back end it turned

768
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:31,710
out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a lot harder than we thought</font>

769
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,080
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be so it hasn't entirely</font>

770
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,419
landed there are still weird edge cases

771
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,070
around what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when backends have</font>

772
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,179
two versions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same algorithm and</font>

773
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,980
what order do you want to load them in

774
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,739
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course for those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

775
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,450
have worked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the setuptools</font>

776
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:47,159
morass of nightmare makes it very

777
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,470
difficult to actually land a lot of this

778
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:51,480
stuff so a lot of work going on in it

779
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,039
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source stuff it's patchy to and bsd</font>

780
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,109
all this codes up on github you can pull

781
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,489
it tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> or today it's you can pip</font>

782
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,499
install it today everything works great

783
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,289
if it doesn't work great then it's a bug

784
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:02,429
and you should hop<font color="#E5E5E5"> on IRC and yell at us</font>

785
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:04,350
it's maintained and tested like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

786
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:05,700
we have a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> test group we've got 40</font>

787
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,770

788
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,940
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome Adam Langley</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of</font>

789
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,289
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have pitched in a couple of</font>

790
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">times and so it's really starting to get</font>

791
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it so I'm not that many people that</font>

792
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,090
implement crypto code so when you have

793
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,620
60 or 70 of them hanging out in IRC

794
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,600
channel you pretty much got all of them

795
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,668
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that many people that are</font>

796
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,928
out there so besides of course ignoring

797
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD guys and stuff that aren't</font>

allowed to to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the open</font>

799
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,980
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and then Python support right</font>

800
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,850
now we actively test on and support 26

801
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,520
27 32 33 34 pie pie and some other stuff

802
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,500
as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out so pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much if you</font>

803
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,639
are running Python you can run this

804
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,620
stuff even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're running some</font>

horribly old version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM which is</font>

806
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,479
like the bane of my existence so future

807
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:54,330
work like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 is big for us it's</font>

808
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:57,299
a huge amount of work George stripes

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing I don't know if nobody from stripe</font>

811
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,610
here right I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask because i want</font>

812
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to thank them but they basically do</font>

813
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,240
grants to open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff kind of</font>

814
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,650
google Summer of Code style and they did

815
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,440
a grant for someone to write a TLS

816
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,600
implementation entirely in Python<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman is working on that who's</font>

820
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,679
like yesterday so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go play with</font>

821
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,970
it if you want it's a full TLS

implementation entirely in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python</font>

823
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,549
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something you're going to</font>

824
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,780
put in production but certainly some if

825
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever want to understand what TLS 1.2</font>

826
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,629
looks like and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works from a code</font>

827
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,658
perspective it's a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier</font>

828
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,130
than reading openssl but anyway very

829
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,450
cool stuff and that's helped push

830
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,830
cryptography down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she</font>

831
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,020
needed a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of features from us and so</font>

832
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,120
we've been doing stuff there's some less

833
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,039
common produce so Google is and is super

834
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,168
happy about some of the DJ<font color="#CCCCCC"> be primitives</font>

835
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,090
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> cha cha 20 and salsa so these are</font>

836
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,669
new cryptographic primitives that Google

837
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,230
is using for TLS they're pushing a lot

<font color="#E5E5E5">of other folks to use them as well as</font>

839
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,909
people have lost faith and<font color="#E5E5E5"> NIST and some</font>

840
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,439
of the other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of phipps requirements</font>

841
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:57,120
these things these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really great</font>

842
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,830
ciphers they have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know strong</font>

843
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,539
resistance against timing attacks and

844
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,860
and some of the side channel attacks

845
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,629
that we've been seeing against a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

846
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,520
the normal ciphers they're also quite

847
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,230
fast which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why Google likes them as</font>

848
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,340
well so there's lots and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

849
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,070
interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people to be able to start</font>

850
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,270
to play these things and then multiple

851
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,689
back and support like I said we'll work

852
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:16,740
on that one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's github com</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qia a</font>

853
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,490
cryptography or you can just go to

854
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,380
cryptography

855
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,110
I oh we are super anal about our

856
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,760
documentation so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty good I'm</font>

857
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,219
pretty excited about how good it is

858
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,750
honest in fact are like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the major</font>

859
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,130
cause of build failures for us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

860
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,420
Doc's because we actually check that

861
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,950
every link is still live in the

862
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,420
documentation before we push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it those</font>

863
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,840
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sucks more than you</font>

864
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,970
would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that breaks a lot but</font>

865
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,500
anyway you can pip install it today it

866
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,000
all works if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to come play I</font>

867
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,559
think one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

868
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about in these these presentations is</font>

869
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,750
that they are run into a lot of

870
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,400
developers when they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

871
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,630
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of has the same as like</font>

872
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,429
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about crypto</font>

873
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a crypto developer and I've been</font>

874
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:54,059
told over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

875
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,220
shouldn't implement my own crypto so I

876
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:59,100
can't really help you or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever that's</font>

877
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,320
mostly BS right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think David Reed he's</font>

878
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,760
one of our boat that like 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

879
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,340
telling developers not to implement

880
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,679
cryptography is basically just led to a

881
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of shitty cryptography it's the</font>

882
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,580
abstinence-only cryptographic approach

883
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,960
right it's bad right at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

884
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,399
day this is code like anything other and

885
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,390
as developers you have to use this stuff

886
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's becoming more and more</font>

887
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,960
prevalent where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

888
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">write systems without having good parts</font>

889
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,350
of those systems having crypto

890
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,550
primitives and prick instructions this

891
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,110
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen right we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

892
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,460
have to protect more data everything's

893
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,419
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be encrypted on the wire right</font>

894
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,820
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be better at</font>

895
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,170
this stuff and so we need developer to

896
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,280
come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to us right if for no</font>

897
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,050
other reason than we need people to tell

898
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,520
us when our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doc's suck and when we look</font>

899
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the recipe layer the recipe layer is</font>

900
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,690
designed to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems the devs have</font>

901
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:41,610
right not cryptographic library

902
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,050
developers like application developers

903
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:44,520
right and so we need people to come in

904
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,559
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey I'm trying to do this in my</font>

905
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,389
app how do I do this right okay well

906
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's go figure that out right and then</font>

907
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,270
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there's always you know like</font>

908
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,890
any of the people who work on

909
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:55,920
cryptography including myself did not

910
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">start as crypto people right so you know</font>

911
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,940
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go implement my own</font>

912
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of AES that's probably not super</font>

913
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,050
smart right but working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group of</font>

914
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,550
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this you can build code you</font>

915
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,800
can get reviews from very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> smart</font>

916
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,210
people it's worth it so if you have any

917
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,559
interest in cryptography if you have an

918
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,390
interesting security you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want please</font>

919
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,770
come hang out in the IRC channel and

920
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,179
help out there's plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to do</font>

921
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,340
even for people who are who don't

922
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,870
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves crypto experts and I</font>

923
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,820
will say the number one way to identify

924
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,928
a crypto expert is how vociferous Lee

925
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,879
they tell you they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

926
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,260
cryptography expert right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

927
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,550
more you work on cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

928
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,120
you understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't head about</font>

929
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,139
cryptography now that's it so happy to

930
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,179
take any questions if anyone

931
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,640
has any thanks for taking time out of

932
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,870
lunch at the you know at the start of

933
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,250
this literally like when this was

934
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:40,169
supposed to start there were two of us

935
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,330
so we were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit down and</font>

936
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a conversation but you know they</font>

937
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:55,050
wanted to film it so I get all fancy so

938
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:57,810
any questions yes it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> real bad that</font>

939
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,790
was the biggest surprise you know like

940
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I think everybody was super surprised</font>

941
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:05,760
at how little support openssl was

942
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:08,370
getting and the way in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which openssl got</font>

943
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,500
support right so there were like two and

944
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,419
a half guys that worked in openssl only

945
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,730
one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it full time and they</font>

946
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,900
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> got paid by feature right so they</font>

947
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,040
were never they weren't working on it

948
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,990
full time it was like oh you're paid to

949
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,550
implement this thing on an hourly basis

950
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,650
and so they were just grafting on these

951
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,060
like these ugly bulbs<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the side of</font>

952
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,340
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a cell and that's the way it been</font>

953
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,080
for like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years right so the thing</font>

954
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,699
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a disaster is a disaster it</font>

955
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,980
still got like<font color="#E5E5E5"> back support in there i</font>

956
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,200
mean it's a nightmare right and the

957
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">python stuff was basically somebody</font>

958
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,050
needed something and they hacked this

959
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">python library together eight years ago</font>

960
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,290
and they're still stuck maintaining it

961
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,520
and so it's like it's weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that</font>

962
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:43,379
like cryptography has only been around

963
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like eight or nine</font>

964
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,180
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but like even four or five</font>

965
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">months in these crypto guys the library</font>

966
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tanner's we're coming out school and</font>

967
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,020
please like I want to rebase my library

968
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,520
I don't want to do this anymore like

969
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,570
doing this by myself sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't want</font>

970
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the first place it's just</font>

971
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,310
nobody else is doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we didn't</font>

972
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,629
run into a lot of problems with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

973
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,250
who were really protective of their code

974
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,170
bases or any of that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

975
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really just like oh hey you guys are</font>

976
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:09,390
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a really stable awesome</font>

977
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,940
cryptographic basis for Python that's

978
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome right and i think you know it's</font>

979
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">funny like this crew has now gotten to</font>

980
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,780
be kind of evangelistic about

981
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,430
cryptography and so like the

982
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,649
cryptographic crew are the ones who push

983
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,750
the peps to backport all of the ssl

984
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,890
improvements that happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python 3</font>

985
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,630
back to 27 so that people would get them

986
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,190
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any of you have been</font>

987
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,900
on the pipe on dev list that is an

988
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,890
enormous asked to dip into that morass

989
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,690
you know so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

990
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,730
thing that surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> me was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like so</font>

991
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,260
many systems so much critical

992
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,180
infrastructure was built on top of this

993
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,450
like rickety foundation that no one had

994
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,039
spent any time looking at

995
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,149
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> then Hartley and all this kind of</font>

996
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,408
stuff started to happen if you're like

997
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:49,928
oh my god we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should spend money on this</font>

998
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:51,429
stuff but yeah but coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was</font>

999
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:53,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big surprise for me and of</font>

1000
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,610
course just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enormous lack of testing</font>

1001
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,959
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sea communities like mostly see</font>

1002
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,370
libraries are super old so you can't

1003
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,440
really blame them if they were writing

1004
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">now they would probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have tests but</font>

1005
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,240
like openssl has no tested like none

1006
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,279
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do a release process</font>

1007
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,860
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dump some live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like here</font>

1008
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,510
you go and they have like a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub</font>

1009
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">point release will change interfaces and</font>

1010
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,990
break stuff right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's like</font>

1011
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,518
sure there's no kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actual release</font>

1012
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,590
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything it's just like two</font>

1013
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys and like okay done get push right</font>

1014
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,908
and like here<font color="#E5E5E5"> he goes and you're really</font>

1015
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,230
some openssl right of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1016
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Red Hat makes it even worse because then</font>

1017
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,480
they'd take the source and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch</font>

1018
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,830
themselves and don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the version</font>

1019
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,260
numbers and so no one knows what's going

1020
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">on but but anyway so yeah that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1021
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,080
thing for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just kind of how weird</font>

1022
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and creepy it was once you got</font>

1023
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,600
underneath the covers of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like</font>

1024
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,429
fancy you know so you're running like

1025
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,809
ansible and all that stuff plantable

1026
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:40,360
underneath the covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> para miko and</font>

1027
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">param eco sits on top of you know all of</font>

1028
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,199
this crypto stuff underneath right into

1029
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,309
this like all this fancy new stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1030
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,510
we're doing it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev ops and</font>

1031
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:47,918
awesome and then underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> the covers</font>

1032
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,120
it's like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really gross stuff that's</font>

1033
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,980
all sitting on code that was written 15

1034
00:33:49,120 --> 00:34:03,518
years ago cool any other questions yeah

1035
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:05,169
Oh inside us pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much nothing so</font>

1036
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">fernet obviously the construction for</font>

1037
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">fernet is written in Python there are a</font>

1038
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of bits that we've done that so</font>

1039
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,540
we tried very hard to stay away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1040
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:16,029
that the goal being the cryptography

1041
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,259
should not have to be audited<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

1042
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,030
cryptographic from a cryptographic

1043
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,399
perspective we want to use primitives

1044
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,510
all want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and see there are some</font>

1045
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:24,250
things that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so we have a</font>

1046
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">back-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example like we patched up</font>

1047
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,239
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb you ran them as a</font>

1048
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,879
back-end instead of openness as cells

1049
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,339
internal like orangey nonsense that was

1050
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,929
a really bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea so there's a couple of</font>

1051
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:36,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we've kind of skirted the edge of</font>

1052
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we should do in Python</font>

1053
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,839
but we try very hard not to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1054
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,859
any of that work in Python I think the

1055
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing that I would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1056
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:45,069
be kind of on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border would be some</font>

1057
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key management aspects of things</font>

1058
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:50,168
so like transferring<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys between like</font>

1059
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:53,469
openssl and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Votan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually really</font>

1060
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:55,690
hard there's no like<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed-upon kind of</font>

1061
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,520
structure data structure be able to do

1062
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,960
that and see

1063
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,550
end up breaking keys down into the core

1064
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,380
constituent parts like<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their</font>

1065
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,640
primes and then you're shipping these

1066
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,130
primes and then you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reconstruct</font>

1067
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,569
them so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little hanky but it's</font>

1068
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad it's pretty if I mean it's</font>

1069
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,000
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well defined and then you can do</font>

1070
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,380
that pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not really doing a lot of</font>

1071
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,750
calculation and it's just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of moving</font>

1072
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">things around so it's the goal we'll see</font>

1073
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,020
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean like at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day once</font>

1074
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:17,939
if this gets really popular i think you

1075
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,590
know i'd like to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rack to pony up for</font>

1076
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,780
us to to go and actually have it looked

1077
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,040
at by a cryptographer sir or if one of

1078
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">those guys want to do it for free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1079
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:33,770
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but those things are super</font>

1080
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:33,770
expensive any other questions yeah

1081
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:59,640
so the the key piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> burnt is as a</font>

1082
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,470
developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you shouldn't care if you want</font>

1083
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can go look it up and if you</font>

1084
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can specify what it</font>

1085
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,540
is but the important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fernet</font>

1086
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,940
is that it has algorithmic agility

1087
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,620
underneath the covers and so you can

1088
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,760
actually change out the algorithm and

1089
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,080
the work factors and all the other

1090
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,430
features of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's actually being used</font>

1091
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,170
from an encryption perspective without

1092
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,940
going to change your<font color="#E5E5E5"> code at all right</font>

1093
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,010
so imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> Everett somebody finds that</font>

1094
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,590
there's an attack against<font color="#E5E5E5"> AS 128 right</font>

1095
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,330
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh well now I want to move for</font>

1096
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,950
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on the fly</font>

1097
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,600
you tweak a couple of parameters and

1098
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allison</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using a different graphic</font>

1099
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,460
primitive are covered you don't change

1100
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,810
the rest of your application but for for

1101
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,000
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> users like it sometimes you'll have</font>

1102
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,320
a directive from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security you know</font>

1103
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,610
group that says you must use these

1104
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,370
parameters from encryption standpoint

1105
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,540
you can tune those if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want generally</font>

1106
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,490
we try to tell developers like don't do

1107
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but if you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to you then</font>

1108
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can delve underneath</font>

1109
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,569
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say no I want this and I</font>

1110
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,910
want this and I want this I want this

1111
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,350
construct with this the hash and so for

1112
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,850
customers that are using the need<font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps</font>

1113
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,440
compliance they have to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1114
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,540
pips is very prescriptive about what

1115
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
you're allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the openssl phipps</font>

1116
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,779
modules like sliced off and it only has

1117
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain things that you can do and all</font>

1118
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,430
that so you have to use those things but

1119
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,430
yeah the goal would be don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1120
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,109
it it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same default and those</font>

1121
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,100
defaults will change over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you</font>

1122
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't actually care if they change</font>

1123
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,670
because it handles the change for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1124
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,690
right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1125
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,210
Matt I've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about for a long</font>

1126
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,470
time around key management like as

1127
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,000
consultants we notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font>

1128
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications would use keys but they</font>

1129
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">never built the ability to rotate the</font>

1130
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,680
key so rotating the key was actually a

1131
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,580
really painful process since<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

1132
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,049
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would notice that the</font>

1133
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,540
same key been used for the last like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1134
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,550
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they never rotated it and so</font>

1135
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,630
you know by using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frenette or something</font>

1136
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,950
like that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you all of that</font>

1137
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,510
agility and the ability to do all that

1138
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">the developer doesn't have to build all</font>

1139
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that code and software around it</font>

1140
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">burnet just kind of gives you all that</font>

1141
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,439
for free<font color="#E5E5E5"> well not for free the Roku guys</font>

1142
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,460
spent all the money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build it but but</font>

1143
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,460
it's free and<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

1144
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:00,320
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember right you can tweak fernet</font>

1145
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,580
without having to dig too deep it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1146
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,560
so it's kind of in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1147
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,680
generally the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us on the recipe</font>

1148
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,870
layer is to not have anyone say a yes

1149
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,580
right you know like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

1150
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,440
talking about algorithms or bit links or

1151
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,279
you know key generation methods or the

1152
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,110
different type of random number

1153
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,240
generation some of that really belongs

1154
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,770
mostly in hazmat but if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1155
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,419
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like reach in a kind of dust want</font>

1156
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,100
Burnett and ninety-eight percent of it

1157
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,020
I'm fine with but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tweak this</font>

1158
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,759
one thing or these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1159
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably okay it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to her too</font>

1160
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,680
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam oh sure yeah let me just Python</font>

1161
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,850
right there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing that prevents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1162
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,560
from going down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the hazmat layer</font>

1163
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,029
other than the name and the fact that we

1164
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,210
right here be dragons unlike every

1165
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,950
single page so<font color="#CCCCCC"> thats yeah yeah so you</font>

1166
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you can dive down and you can all go</font>

1167
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the way down to the binding level if</font>

1168
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,740
you want to tie yourself to openssl and

1169
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,460
use some method directly you can do that

1170
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the goal is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1171
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,840
cryptography easy to use for devs and so

1172
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,610
the documentation kind of drives you to

1173
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,990
the easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use pieces of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that being</font>

1174
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,130
said we have a lot of other libraries

1175
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:57,529
that sit on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and those</font>

1176
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,850
libraries need low level primitives but

1177
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,370
the assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that those guys know</font>

1178
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:04,069
what they're doing and so that's fine

1179
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,210
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big piece for us it was to</font>

1180
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,910
Matt's question of what surprised me

1181
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,730
right like nothing worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> pi PI not</font>

1182
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,379
when we first look mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because</font>

1183
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,360
how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they bounded the sea layers was</font>

1184
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,640
all super old stuff with swig and and so

1185
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,580
it just didn't work with with pi PI and

1186
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,290
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the binding layer is useful to</font>

1187
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:27,830
other library authors so they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1188
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:29,860
that directly sometime<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

1189
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,860
guys
