1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,800
before we start talking about um privacy

2
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,740
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a shout out to martin</font>

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,650
hellman um he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just amazing yesterday</font>

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,510
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to tell you when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was asked</font>

5
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,519
to do this keynote I was like ah yeah

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">this will be really great then I saw</font>

7
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:40,260
martin hellman on the on the list too

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,920
and I'm like oh crap i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to talk</font>

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,379
after him that's not going to be good um

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,809
the other thing is is that I'm in a PhD

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,739
program and I'm studying cryptography

12
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,218
and I took an exam on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday before</font>

13
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,940
arriving here and pretty much bombed it

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,949
in full disclosure and so when I saw

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,500
Martin eyes kind of punched him in the

16
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,970
arm a little bit I said your work is a

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,830
bane of my existence right now

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,298
so instead he gave me a hug and he said

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,600
you'll get through and I said thank you

20
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:16,640
very much but talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me in december</font>

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,780
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get my passing grade and i can</font>

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue on with my PhD work so anyway I</font>

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,640
also want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that yesterday Chris's</font>

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,310
keynote was also very exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,950
proud to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the room when he was</font>

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,170
talking but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I want you to have</font>

27
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:37,060
the perspective that Chris is the devil

28
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,550
on your shoulder and I will be the angel

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:43,460
so you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hear f-bombs you will</font>

30
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,069
not hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> crew jokes I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for those</font>

31
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,610
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that love that but this is</font>

32
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:52,750
me so before I begin I want to tell you

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:57,319
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about my journey before</font>

34
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,720
2008 my career was primarily focused on

35
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,720
marketing project management and

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,479
strategic initiatives then a personal

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,419
situation lodged me into the space of

38
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,459
security starting around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of two</font>

39
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,510
thousand seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> I became the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> target of</font>

40
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,140
cyber stalking by a colleague a

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,870
situation you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably imagine</font>

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,720
reframes how you think about privacy and

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,359
security and about how we all behave on

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet this was something that</font>

45
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:32,450
totally changed my life that sounds like

46
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:34,459
a Hallmark card I know but it did but

47
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,850
unlike some stalkers mine wasn't caught

48
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,910
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people say where is he did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

49
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">get caught was he brought to justice</font>

50
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:52,400
unfortunately no and he wasn't because

51
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:55,040
he used tor go figure so unlike other

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,650
victims I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the poster</font>

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,578
child of cyber stalking in fact I have

54
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,380
to tell you that it's a little

55
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">uncomfortable for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to even talk about</font>

56
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">it anymore because it's like opening up</font>

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,488
old wounds but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

58
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:13,190
did was it inspired me to learn to

59
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,940
figure out why the technology works the

60
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,170
way does because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what the</font>

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,660
heck was happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me I</font>

62
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,488
skiing text messages on my phone I was

63
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,170
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> told by law enforcement that they</font>

64
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,260
couldn't get him because he was using

65
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,609
this magical thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor I'm like</font>

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,859
what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean he's sitting in</font>

67
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,209
California you know who he is I know who

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,270
he is but you're not going to be able to

69
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,489
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I had a restraining order and the</font>

70
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:42,390
judge vacated it because she says he's

71
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:46,019
using tor and we can't identify him

72
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:49,380
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a doubt so I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn how</font>

73
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology works I want to figure</font>

74
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,890
out why the system of law enforcement

75
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,920
wasn't equipped to help victims of cyber

76
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,809
related crimes and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,130
about what people think about how much

78
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,739
they're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there on the</font>

79
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,680
internet I'm a mom of two teenage girls

80
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,930
and I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of how much they're</font>

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,850
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there on the internet but I</font>

82
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,160
also wanted to be able to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people</font>

83
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help them understand you have to</font>

84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">pause you have to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,000
you're putting out there not to scare

86
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,889
the crap out of people I'm sure Chris

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,229
would use stronger words than that but

88
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,060
not to scare the crap out of people by

89
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,580
telling them this horrible story of

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,960
cyberstalking but I want people to

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,130
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know what there's</font>

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,620
real people intelligent good kind people

93
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:38,100
that are put into situations they never

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:43,110
wanted to be in and those situations

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,400
have to change you but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

96
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,100
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,599
horrible crap to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things</font>

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:54,380
differently so at the end of two

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,169
thousand eleven i hit my lowest point

100
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,140
now 2008 to 2011 we're talking three

101
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:03,930
years and he didn't just attack me he

102
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,729
attacked everyone in my life if you were

103
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,490
loosely associated with me you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

104
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,860
contacted by this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens</font>

105
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,820
tell you what a horrible horrible person

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,680
I was so I was not only answering had to

107
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,360
answer to him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get his attacks but I</font>

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,330
had to answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the people in my</font>

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">life or who are also being contacted and</font>

110
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,760
explaining to them the situation so

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,940
after almost three years of fear and

112
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,050
uncertainty I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided it was</font>

113
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,139
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

114
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,629
living or get busy dying this is an

115
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,009
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> movie by the way hopefully you</font>

116
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,530
guys have seen if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't seen it</font>

117
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:44,610
Shawshank Redemption Tim Robbins is

118
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,739
adorable um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want my work to</font>

119
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,530
be focused on him that's what stalkers

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,169
like they like all the focus to be on

121
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,448
them I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> my efforts to be focused</font>

122
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:57,270
on leveling up and adding to the

123
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:01,259
conversation and look I will never be a

124
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,549
programmer I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and my</font>

125
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,289
hats off to all of you who are

126
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,780
programmers because you create the

127
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:09,210
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes our lives as</font>

128
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,710
wonderful as it is today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as secure</font>

129
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,680
incidence today so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for that</font>

130
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,388
but then in 2012<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was sitting in the</font>

131
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,840
conference similar to this kind of

132
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:24,360
pissed off because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sight it was</font>

133
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,239
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference on employees employers</font>

134
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,129
against cyber stalking and I thought hey

135
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,830
as a marketing professional I should be

136
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:33,240
up there talking but instead they had

137
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,758
Andrew lumen from the Tor project

138
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,219
talking I'm like okay I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

139
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
this conference okay I'm gonna wear my

140
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:42,419
pointy shoes and I'm going to sit there

141
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen to this guy that</font>

142
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,539
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go up and I'm going to</font>

143
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
punch him in the arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say your</font>

144
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:49,620
technology is getting in the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,190

people hope so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away tour yes</font>

214
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe you'll get a couple of bad guys</font>

225

defending rights of privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and freedom</font>

227
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,749
of speech on the internet all while

228
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:38,799
thinking wow the bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out there</font>

229
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:40,679
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do they really want so I</font>

230
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,119
started talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the press and</font>

231
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:45,329
participating on task force to help

00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:48,249
human trafficking and child pornography

233
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:51,399
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues around human trafficking and</font>

child pornography and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you a</font>

235
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,779
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that a little and a little</font>

236
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:57,850
bit but what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is talk a</font>

237
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,529
little bit about tour and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

238
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,629
raised to some of the important

239
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,939
questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen that have come</font>

240
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:06,309
up around<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy that I really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

242
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,689
and in your lives frankly because

243
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,149
privacy isn't something you just do

244
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:18,339
while you're at work it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

245
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:20,799
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about all the time so</font>

246
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,319
my job was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help people understand</font>

250
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,119
I don't want to say something that's

251
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:39,339
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be recorded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on youtube tauros</font>

252

are people in our community however that

255
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:49,809
are very vocal on certain issues around

256
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:51,248
privacy and anonymity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and when</font>

257
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,559
you're working in an open source

258
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:55,580
environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal with the</font>

261
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,730
whenever I talked to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

constant communication with the press

278
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was most challenging three weeks of</font>

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,469
my entire career was when that picture

280

was launched into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space of not just</font>

282
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,640
around technology but was really

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,960
launched in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space of privacy and</font>

00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymity in a very very big way but we</font>

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,160
also as I mentioned we build the

286
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,260
technology to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help journalists I do a</font>

287
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of training a lot of conversations</font>

288
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,040
with journalists because you know what

289
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are most of them who are especially</font>

290
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,050
who do foreign service type of reporting

291
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,780
are very good at understanding physical

292
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,370
security you know don't be in a place

293
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might get killed kind of</font>

294
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">security but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often they don't understand</font>

295
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,830
digital security and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love talking</font>

296
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">to journalists I love telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them about</font>

297
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,800
how to use tor how to use other privacy

298
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:46,010
and anonymity tools to help keep them

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,880
safe but I also like to do it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

300
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,980
their minds to not only how what they do

301
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,380
impacts their security but how what

302
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,260
their sources do also<font color="#E5E5E5"> impacts there's</font>

303
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,240
their security so one of the things I'm

304
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,680
very passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just</font>

305
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,350
transferring the knowledge that I have

306
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,310
but also doing it in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can</font>

307
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,310
bring it on to others

308
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,370
so as I mentioned towards a community

309
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,399
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are community without borders</font>

310
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,490
without governance and without structure

311
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:23,480
it's a network of people at last count I

312
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:26,029
think there were over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5500 tour relay</font>

313
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,940
operators volunteers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world it's</font>

314
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:31,939
very hard for people to understand that

315
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">how tour operates really is about that</font>

316
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and that network is full of</font>

317
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:40,540
volunteers can you imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

318
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:45,080
organization being completely driven by

319
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:49,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">5,000 plus faceless volunteers some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

320
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,920
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> nameless volunteers how would that</font>

321
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">change how you can do your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job you're at</font>

322
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mercy of all these volunteers so</font>

323
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,060
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this network of people they hide</font>

324
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">in plain view some are hidden in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

325
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,050
ways but they're all committed to

326
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,680
tourists technology and they're

327
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,910
committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keeping tour in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

328
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:18,140
so and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that tourist thing</font>

329
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,839
came up of in Paris when it was

330
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:26,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">determined one of our developers</font>

331
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:28,700
actually released a story timely was we

332
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,990
were all at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers conference in</font>

333
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,760
Paris<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire organization and he</font>

334
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,680
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release the story to the</font>

335
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:42,709
press about how the NSA was tracking any

336
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,620
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> act or project email accounts and</font>

337
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,329
how people who were associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

338
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,250
Tor project anyone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was associated</font>

339
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:51,650
working for Thornton project was a

340
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:55,610
terrorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was a really</font>

341
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:58,459
difficult thing to experience as a mom

342
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,450
as a professional as somebody who

343
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:05,060
believes in privacy but when this came

344
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,360
out somebody in our community of course

345
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,029
made a t-shirt and I freaked out like oh

346
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,070
my god we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put a cap on this but</font>

347
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,310
again that's the challenge when you're

348
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,630
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the commune</font>

349
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,719
versus an organization where you have

350
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,990
governance anyway I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they took it</font>

351
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,450
down but let's talk about privacy versus

352
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:27,340
security now Chris touched on this

353
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,590
yesterday so I'm not going to go through

354
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he did an excellent job going</font>

355
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:34,840
through all those crazy slides I loved

356
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,730
it but I do want to talk to you about

357
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,010
the difference between the two because

358
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,750
it's important and it's important not

359
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,370
just for your work but it's important

360
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,220
for how you're communicating talking

361
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,980
with end users<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because even if in</font>

362
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,630
your organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a b2b type of</font>

363
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,000
organization or you're not directly

364
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,650
related to end users when you are out

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,210
there in the world talking to family

366
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,010
members talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to friends talking</font>

367
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,080
anybody who wants you to do technical

368
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,319
support does anybody have family members

369
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,420
who asked you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do tech support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

370
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,910
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to them though you're</font>

371
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,589
talking to end users so what I hope that

372
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,110
you'll take away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is some new</font>

373
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,159
thoughts around privacy and security in

374
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:18,159
a way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to those folks</font>

375
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,130
so privacy the ability to control what

376
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,190
personal information is shared out there

377
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:27,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay simple keep a simple definition of</font>

378
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:30,220
privacy in mind security is a resistance

379
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of desired loss they are kissing cousins</font>

380
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,840
no doubt but they are very very

381
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,610
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> concepts so often when people</font>

382
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,770
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you know what Kelly I</font>

383
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,399
want to talk about privacy it's great

384
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:45,040
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk what does privacy mean to you</font>

385
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,610
is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them because</font>

386
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,110
often people mix up the two so the first

387
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,419
thing I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask is that you be</font>

388
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,439
clear about what privacy means and the

389
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,870
difference it is to security and

390
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,850
yesterday I don't agree with a lot

391
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:03,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do agree with Chris's</font>

392
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,709
statement about the end users but

393
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:08,860
they're not the only weakest link in our

394
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,010
system of privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security the</font>

395
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,740
technology you know I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

396
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,920
research paper I presented it last week

397
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,200
at a conference it's a taxonomy around

398
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,399
privacy enhancing tools for the world

399
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,729
wide web<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I looked at</font>

400
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:29,488
things like steganos I quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> DuckDuckGo</font>

401
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:31,200
and it wasn't to bang on their

402
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:33,479
technology and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,509
all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not working it was</font>

404
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:38,369
more around let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me understand what you</font>

405
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:40,559
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're delivering to end-users</font>

406
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:43,289
and then what your terms of agreement

407
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,299
are really saying you will do or not do

408
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,259
if you know your feet are put to the

409
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:52,789
fire and helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bridge that gap so</font>

410
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:56,879
that end-users understand look if I use

411
00:18:52,789 --> 00:19:01,469
DuckDuckGo without tour I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

412
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:04,080
be secure okay if I use steganos the

413
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:06,210
free version I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be secure</font>

414
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,399
and there's several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technologies</font>

415
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,049
that I researched that openly say in

416
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:12,089
their terms of agreement that if they

417
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,849
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> subpoena them they are contacted by</font>

418
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:18,539
law enforcement they will give<font color="#CCCCCC"> up their</font>

419
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:20,399
user data<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is again not to</font>

420
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:23,908
scare people but it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping</font>

421
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:26,129
end users understand where privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls</font>

422
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,690
and where the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help them</font>

423
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:32,218
are not help them depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

424
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,109
situation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the weakest links</font>

425
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:36,929
can be the end users it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

426
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:40,428
technology it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be what we don't</font>

427
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:43,619
know we don't know yet you know Jesus

428
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:46,169
2000a I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy in my little</font>

429
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:49,139
marketing space doing my project

430
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,999
management not worried just thinking you

431
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:52,889
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these magical developers out there</font>

432
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:56,219
will create products that will keep me

433
00:19:52,889 --> 00:20:00,779
safe then I was kicked out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

434
00:19:56,219 --> 00:20:04,049
mindset realizing that it's much bigger

435
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:06,929
and I have to educate myself in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

436
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:11,429
be safe and there are far more questions

437
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:14,159
out there than answers but let's be

438
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:16,559
honest we are our own worst enemies when

439
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,749
it comes to protecting privacy and I

440
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,149
love having debates with people I love

441
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the conversation I had a</font>

442
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:28,228
conversation in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speaker's lounge</font>

443
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,479
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentlemen yesterday I can't see him</font>

444
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:32,249
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I forget his name we were</font>

445
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,970
talking with Jim and he was telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

446
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:38,280
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> he keeps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> himself secure</font>

447
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,830
through a burner laptop and some other

448
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was fun because then I</font>

449
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,330
asked some questions like that how did

450
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,500
you buy that plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticket to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Island</font>

451
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went to bring that burner</font>

452
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,170
laptop too and it's it's fun having

453
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:57,020
those conversations to poke the<font color="#E5E5E5"> holes in</font>

454
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">people's ideas of privacy and security</font>

455
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,290
the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to mention</font>

456
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,940
is that in those conversations that

457
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,010
you're having with the real people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

458
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,350
your life your friends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your family</font>

459
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:10,260
have real conversations with them about

460
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,480
privacy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security not to scare them</font>

461
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,030
but just to understand where they're at

462
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,670
I had a conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a parent I</font>

463
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,129
gave a talk at a high school again I try

464
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,110
not to give the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> giant scary story</font>

465
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,890
and saying oh yeah I was cyber stalked

466
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,080
for going on seven years I was cyber

467
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,020
stalked it's awful I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't wish it</font>

468
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,429
upon anybody what I try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use help</font>

469
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,320
people understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what it</font>

470
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,360
can happen to just about anybody and

471
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,659
this mom comes up to me and she said you

472
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:44,030
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what my kids phone doesn't have</font>

473
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:46,800
Wi-Fi so he will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cyber bullied</font>

474
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:51,780
this is real<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a you know an</font>

475
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,090

476
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,680
good poker face so I will never play

477
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,189
poker here at last count if you ever

478
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:03,180
offer it lose my shirt but I said to her

479
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:05,220
I it's much bigger than half I said

480
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,350
cyber bullying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues of privacy</font>

481
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,390
are much bigger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

482
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,669
Wi-Fi on your phone so she was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

483
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,170
wrap her head around that but as parents

484
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,350
she was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure out some</font>

485
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,510
solutions for her kids but back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

486
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,270
issues of that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">wanting security and yet we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

501
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,980
people walking around on their phones

502
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:04,120
talking to whomever with the world

503

505
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:14,050
example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was sitting in his hotel</font>

506
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,240
earlier this<font color="#E5E5E5"> week and joined a</font>

507
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,350
conversation with some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who were</font>

508
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,380
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some new business</font>

509
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:23,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">development and not once did they ask</font>

510
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:27,700
who he was and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaging in the</font>

511
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,500
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I find it very funny</font>

512
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are raising these big flags</font>

513
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,710
that we have to have privacy on the

514
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,680
internet we have to have security and

515
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,380
yet our own human behaviors are getting

516
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:45,070
in the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things working well this</font>

517
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:47,560
woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a prime example so I don't want</font>

518
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,730
to be fatalistic about this but there

519
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,860
are big questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to answer</font>

520
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,750
where is my data really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and these</font>

521
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,459
questions that that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

522
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,240
you come out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of conversations</font>

523
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:04,450
I've had with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with the press and</font>

524
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,100
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> own research but what people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

525
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,170
starting to ask is where's our data

526
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,050
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody</font>

527
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:15,820
in this room can truly answer that even

528
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris if he was sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here who are the</font>

529
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,050
third parties that are using our data

530
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:23,440
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody talks about that</font>

531
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,090
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach right and I've had people</font>

532
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,010
come up to me and say Kelly what do you

533
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,070
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened to target and</font>

534
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the third party that had</font>

535
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,360
the issue it wasn't target but target

536
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,330
was the casualty of it because they had

537
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,729
to manage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party but if you</font>

538
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,610
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about from a non security from or</font>

539
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,110
business perspective that's a difficult

540
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,679
conversation for people to wrap their

541
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:50,709
minds around who really sees my

542
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,040
information who's seen the traffic who's

543
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,530
seen the end to end conversations these

544
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:04,270
are important questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-users</font>

545
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:07,330
are asking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a big one oops I</font>

546
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:10,900
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead of myself what assumptions are</font>

547
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:14,830
being made so one of the things that my

548
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:17,020
crazy stalker did was that he went out

549
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,909
to certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

550
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,680
was doing at that time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a Facebook</font>

551
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,420
account I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one anymore so</font>

552
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:28,150
don't don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he did</font>

553
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">was he went out to Facebook and he was</font>

554
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,010
trolling my emails he works<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

555
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,750
technology company that I will not say

556
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,660
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe he's still there and</font>

557
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:41,260
he would take pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and</font>

558
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:44,170
craft a story woven in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all of his</font>

559
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,080
craziness<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and he would present it</font>

560
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,150
out to the world as truth as gospel and

561
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,149
say this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kelly see I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got all these</font>

562
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,770
facts in these figures and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

563
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,890
started making assumptions about me

564
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:01,720
assumptions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to dismiss that I</font>

565
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:03,700
had to fight to counteract so what

566
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,250
people aren't realizing in these issues

567
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,020

accurate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what are we going to do</font>

00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:21,960
about that if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to look at</font>

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,909
my traffic and I'm sure the NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

575
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,860
based on my work at or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I did</font>

576
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,170
have an experience where I saw my cursor

doing things without me even touching my

<font color="#E5E5E5">looked at my traffic they would see</font>

things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kelly was researching all of</font>

those anonymity tools they would see

things that I flew to Purdue that I was

researching like crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> s-boxes des</font>

about four weeks straight but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

586
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,730
also see the things in my personal life

that are related to my children that are

not related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my work so what sorts of</font>

589
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,580
assumptions are people going to make

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with all this data out there</font>

591
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:15,510
lots of people i talked with say ah I

592
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,610
don't need tour I don't need security

593

tools I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide so who</font>

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:23,699
cares if the NSA or anyone else is

595
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,159
looking at my data and what I say to

596
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,530
them is you know what you're probably

597
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,090
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably a great person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

have nothing to hide but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

599
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:37,100
how do you know where it's all going how

600
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:40,110
do you know who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect it I</font>

601
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,139
want to be able to know that at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

602
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,500
of the day that what is out there about

<font color="#E5E5E5">me on the Internet is true an honorable</font>

604
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,230
and good and I can't because people are

605
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,418
also out there making assumptions in

606
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,270
invading my privacy and invading my

607
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:59,610
security so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

608
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,690
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more the other example that</font>

609
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,129
I give people is that look you may have

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,760
someone in your life who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is diagnosed</font>

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,860
with cancer and you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you do</font>

612
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,640
if you have a tragedy like that happens

613
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:17,309
you go on google or WebMD and you start

614
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,100
researching what is this cancer what is

615
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:24,210
my loved one going to have to face so

616
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:29,850
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sudden you're now in a bucket by</font>

the advertisers around cancer but it's

618
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:36,480
not you it's this person<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here so</font>

619
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,100
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we protect ourselves and all this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">information that we're putting out there</font>

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:45,369
I do love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this sign</font>

622

so we can't protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with full certainty</font>

there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to be lots more</font>

627
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:59,559
around cyber stalking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would imagine</font>

628
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:01,830
cyber bullying became hot and in all

sentence not as much in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news anymore</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know where we're going but</font>

631
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">as security professionals and this is</font>

632
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,428
what I'm urging all of you to help me

633
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:17,019
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help others with its to do a</font>

634
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:19,480
better job and doing a better job means

635
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,759
we have to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> people understand that</font>

636
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,059
anonymity does love company and I love

637
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:28,109
this slide I love the slide slight

638
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:30,489
digression because when I talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups</font>

639
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:32,678
younger groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this no offense to</font>

640
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:36,549
anybody in the room the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

641
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,249
ask is who is the band you'd be amazed

642
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:42,720
at how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know who the</font>

643
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:47,440
band is but what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> love about this and</font>

644
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,570
how this seriously but what I loved

645
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,549
about this and what I've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for in</font>

646
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,439
other talks actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if i'm</font>

647
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,710
talking about cyber stalking is that my

648
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,999
stalker walks around looking like all of

649
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,429
you just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal person but the</font>

650
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:07,869
anonymity the tools that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> using is</font>

651
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:12,789
allowing to hide hide him and hide his

652
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:16,359
behavior vice versa<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get to now use</font>

653
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:20,009
these tools to protect myself and that's

654
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:23,590
the balancing act that we have to face

655
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:25,720
so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took out my</font>

656
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,889
call to action slide because<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris made</font>

657
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,889
it sound like that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

658
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:32,469
stupid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it so now you're going to</font>

659
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:35,469
get a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> flavor of it so here's</font>

660
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,919
what I'm asking all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you to do first</font>

661
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,149
bring more voices to the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

662
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,210
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you have come up</font>

663
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:45,639
the ranks fit very hard work lots of

664
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,700
time lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> education computer science</font>

665
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:50,439
and technology coding coding coding

666
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,509
hacking your little fingers off I get it

667
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,520
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are people that</font>

668
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">have not done that that still have a Val</font>

669
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,810
to add to the conversation bring more

670
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,270
voices to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation if you're</font>

671
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,790
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security and privacy bring</font>

672
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:08,629
in non-technical non-technical people to

673
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:10,129
the conversation keep asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even when there might not be</font>

675
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:15,140
any answers people ask me tough

676
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,240
questions all the time and I'm like I

677
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,810
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it let's</font>

678
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,190
figure it out we can't always know

679
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,510
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future and</font>

680
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,250
in the space that we're dealing with

681
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:30,200
with security just look at the evolution

682
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:32,360
over the past eight years holy cow we

683
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,310
would know we would never been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

684
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,169
imagine that we would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in today's</font>

685
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,409
environment regarding security and

686
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:42,500
privacy online technology and privacy

687
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,810
policies with users it's great all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

688
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,360
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you all are doing is fantastic</font>

689
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:50,600
but if you don't step out of your world

690
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,669
and start connecting it with policy and

691
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,429
what the end users are saying and doing

692
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,550
and behaving it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be for naught</font>

693
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:02,180
so I ask you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> please align your work</font>

694
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,340
with privacy policies and users oh just

695
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,500
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one quick thing I'm curious</font>

696
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">about there's this trend of having</font>

697
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,320
privacy officers in organizations and at

698
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,670
first I was like yes now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

699
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,980
starting to shine some<font color="#CCCCCC"> light on what</font>

700
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:19,910
privacy or the importance of privacy and

701
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:23,180
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I was like no why have</font>

702
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,640
privacy in a box and for me when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

703
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,640
about a position like a chief of privacy

704
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,140
officer in an organization it feels like

705
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,330
they're putting privacy in the box like

706
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:36,460
that's their job so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

707
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:41,449
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it just a slight digression</font>

708

non-techies again that's part of the

780
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,510
message here so tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> I challenge you</font>

781
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:07,820
to write down your own definition of

782
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:10,170
privacy for you and for your family and

783
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,720
think about what you're doing to protect

784
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,610
it now I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

785
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,319
a heartbeat and you would say all this

786
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,660
great technology that you're using to

787
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,700
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your privacy but think about it</font>

788
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,700
in terms of your kids your partner's

789
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:27,060
your spouse is your family define what

790
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,069
privacy means to you then think about

791
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">how that translates into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that</font>

792
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,980
you're doing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you hold your own</font>

793
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,590
values<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the definitions of privacy for</font>

794
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,380
me I don't have a choice anymore my view

795
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:43,980
and my definition of privacy was altered

796
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:48,300
the second I met that person and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

797
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:52,200
i wouldn't wished it is not the path I

798
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,360
chose because privacy becomes important

799
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,759
when something happens to wakes us up

800
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,760
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want the bad stuff to happen</font>

801
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,650
to people I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out how to</font>

802
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,890
address these issues of<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy before</font>

803
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:07,170
that stuff happens so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be a</font>

many of the reasons that Chris talked

non-technical people and females

814
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:41,990

870
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,930
know what's going on understanding

871
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,090
started used to be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> feud or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

873
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:46,580
everything life is like this two sides

874
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're never going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to resolve this</font>

875
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:52,130
problem and what you can do is like like

876
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,129
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vaccine anything else we taught</font>

877
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:58,070
that the situation in Turkey overcome

878
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,290
death and I cable a baller now as a big

879
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,470
problem they've been few months not be

880
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:05,150
problem anymore send this I think is

881
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,509
saying these are endless target we need

882
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:10,550
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key for us not blame anybody but</font>

883
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,400
how quick you can adjust the situation

884
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:16,280
it is mine my point now I agree

885
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,580
completely and I think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my</font>

886
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,440
experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> at tour made me realize</font>

887
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,880
especially in the press and there are

888
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,500
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> press who I really</font>

889
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,890
respect and there's members of the press

890
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,500
who I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere near me because I've</font>

891
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:34,210
got such bad and

892
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:36,550
morals<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I realized is that</font>

893
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,310
people want to point the finger at

894
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,260
something when stuff happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when bad</font>

895
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,810
stuff happens they want to point their

896
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:47,020
finger and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's tours fault</font>

897
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:50,140
that this happened hey I did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon</font>

898
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:53,290
as as soon as the FBI agents who took on

899
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:56,020
my case in 2010 called me on the phone

900
00:41:53,290 --> 00:42:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and said you know what there's nothing</font>

901
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:02,440
we can do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's using tor I fell</font>

902
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,810
to my knees<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said how can you tell</font>

903
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,220
me this this is the highest level of law

904
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,670
enforcement in our country and you're

905
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:13,540
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one person I have</font>

906
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:16,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just live with it this is one person</font>

907
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:19,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who he is and they said we can</font>

908
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:23,440
he's using<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor we have to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for him</font>

909
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:25,150
to screw up so for me the whole bane of

910
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,090
my existence back then was this

911
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:32,640
technology until you realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

912
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's the people on the other side</font>

913
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay maybe one more question you buddy</font>

future

919
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:00,599
well I'm distinctly non-technical um and

920
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,849
I like to you know I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

921
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,549
things private because you know there

922
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:06,779
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of creeps out there is you can</font>

923
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,019
know just about looking at youtube

924
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:12,630
comment I mean so I was wondering if

925
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were just any simple ways you know</font>

926
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:17,719
that you know non-technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

927
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:20,819
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my sister and my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mother could um</font>

928
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:22,890
keep you know keep art keep stuff we put

929
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:25,409
out their private and keep our lives

930
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:28,279
private the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is think</font>

931
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:31,199
about it think about what you're doing

932
00:43:28,279 --> 00:43:33,689
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times this technology is so easy</font>

933
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:36,209
for us to use we've become unconscious

934
00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:37,678
when we're sending a text message how

935
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:39,089
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

936
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,399
get to them was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how many people in</font>

937
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:44,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">this room have sent a text message that</font>

938
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:45,598
you wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could get back the second</font>

939
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:48,179
you hit the send button and you're like

940
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,309
oh crap I shouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that right</font>

941
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:51,719
come I know everyone in this room has

942
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:53,759
done that so even though you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

943
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:57,659
raising your hand I know I'm a mom I

944
00:43:53,759 --> 00:44:00,149
have secret powers okay but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

945
00:43:57,659 --> 00:44:02,339
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it before you do it that's</font>

946
00:44:00,149 --> 00:44:06,149
the first layer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy and security</font>

947
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:08,159
before the devices then think about how

948
00:44:06,149 --> 00:44:10,229
you're using your technology make sure

949
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,669
your geo locators are off make sure if

950
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:14,368
you're doing things that you really want

951
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:16,799
to be kept private use tor<font color="#E5E5E5"> tor is easy</font>

952
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:19,469
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you will not be a bad guy if</font>

953
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:21,239
you use tor please know that you will I

954
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:23,819
use toward my children you<font color="#E5E5E5"> store my</font>

955
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,049
daughter used tor to watch Netflix when

956
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:27,719
we were at the tour developers meeting

957
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:30,989
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rec evic having the developers</font>

958
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:33,389
helping her of course which was odd but

959
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:35,609
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first level of any privacy</font>

960
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:39,509
is knowing yourself in your own behavior

961
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">so do that by the way she's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that</font>

962
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,439
untechnical and I'm kind of shame now if

963
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,450
being the security guy in the house

964
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:49,069
traviesa is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of question</font>

965
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:52,580
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the shoemaker's children</font>

966
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:56,120
don't wear shoes I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have kind of a</font>

967
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,830
comment I really believe that about

968
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,310
ninety percent of ninety-eight percent

969
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:04,819
of the users out there have no clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

970
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:06,620
their privacy is is is not price it's

971
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,300
not really private what they put out

972
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:10,880
there anything they do they really have

973
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:13,190
no clue and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

974
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,170
come across as a conspiracy theorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

975
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:20,660
they just write<font color="#CCCCCC"> me off but it's</font>

976
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,970
incredible how much lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy is</font>

977
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,720
you come across as scary and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

978
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,339
going to be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

979
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,330
challenges I should have had slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

980
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:31,880
in your work please try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame things</font>

981
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:34,009
that they're not scary I had colleagues

982
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,560
of my not tour that they would launch a

983
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,390
conversation with let me tell you about

984
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,009
all the journalists that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know they've</font>

985
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:43,850
gotten killed because they didn't use

986
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:45,590
tor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can't launch a conversation</font>

987
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,750
like that because people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

988
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I don't want anything to do with it</font>

989
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so when you're talking about</font>

not wasn't brought up in this space the

992
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:01,549
first way to get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen to you</font>

993
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,290
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's I don't</font>

994
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to see gentle because that sounds</font>

995
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:08,930
weak but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is softened a</font>

996
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:11,390
little bit okay when you talk about PGP

997
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,029
do not talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how ugly and scary it</font>

998
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,770
is talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can function for</font>

999
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,930
them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember you probably all</font>

1000
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,750
remember when passwords first came on

1001
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:21,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the scene and security right and</font>

1002
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody had their mother's maiden name</font>

1003
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,630
or their birth date or their dog's name

1004
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:32,690
but today if you asked general users

1005
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:34,670
about their passwords the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

1006
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,890
say to you yeah I've got numbers I've

1007
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,740
got special characters I've got you know

1008
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,830
phrasing it takes a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for people</font>

1009
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:45,470
to change the behaviors but when they do

1010
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:47,330
Wow and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do with</font>

1011
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,759
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other pieces of security we</font>

1012
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:53,420
have to teach users how to do it in a

1013
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,640
way that is persistent that's polite and

1014
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,790
doesn't scare the pants off

1015
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,310
I would not put any of the tour

1016
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:04,300
developers in a room with non-technical

1017
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:07,720
people but I can explain tour in a way

1018
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:11,200
that non-technical people can get some

1019
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:13,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">of its involving envelopes and pieces of</font>

1020
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:19,720
paper and teaching them about the the

1021
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:22,060
the relays in our system but what I need

1022
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,839
what I hope all of you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away</font>

1023
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:27,940
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this is that you know you guys</font>

1024
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,580
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty intimidating this</font>

1025
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,920
community can be very intimidating not

1026
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">only as a non technical person but as a</font>

1027
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:40,240
woman and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> urge you to be</font>

1028
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,130
mindful and aware of that because we

1029
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,430
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of value to add to this</font>

1030
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:48,160
conversation we may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be we may not be</font>

1031
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:51,850
a part of you know the process in the

1032
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that you want us to be we do to a</font>

1033
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,279
certain degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the reason why</font>

1034
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,730
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to challenge you on that is</font>

1035
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,400
because as a professional I understand

1036
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,350
why I have to learn cryptography as part

1037
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,270
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> program right but I don't</font>

1038
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:12,430
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to calculate X</font>

1039
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:15,660
whores all right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's understanding</font>

1040
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,040
how deep you need to bring users in

1041
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,870
order to get the message through because

1042
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole point is to get the message</font>

1043
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:25,690
through how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there doesn't really</font>

1044
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,670
matter just get the message through but

1045
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,040
I do urge you very very much to

1046
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,050
understand it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not because you're scary</font>

1047
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,810
people because honestly this is one of

1048
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best audiences and the best</font>

1049
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:40,270
conferences I've ever been in because I

1050
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:42,730
felt so welcomed and so at home here

1051
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:45,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group I hope to come back next</font>

1052
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:47,440
year because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take all of this</font>

1053
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,630
and bring it to other security

1054
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,110
conferences I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> will not go to</font>

1055
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,880
RSA because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comfortable space</font>

1056
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,790
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in I hope it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will change</font>

1057
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,140
someday but as a woman and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non</font>

1058
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,470
technical person it's a difficult

1059
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,400
environment to be in maybe when I have

1060
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:08,720
my PhD I'll go back and then I'll wear

1061
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,869
I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD don't bug me sure or</font>

1062
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:14,049
something so anyway Thank you Thank You

1063
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:14,049
