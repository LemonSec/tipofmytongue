87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,590

88
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:16,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present I had a whole presentation</font>

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:20,329
made mr. robert hansen over here is a

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,729
prick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and he posted something that</font>

91
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,979
made me connect to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I felt</font>

92
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,139
about my job and it made me ask a lot of

93
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,940
questions to myself about my job which

94
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,470
turn made me ask a lot of questions

95
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about all of these talks that I've given</font>

96
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,030
around what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell do they mean and</font>

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,680
where we at why am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still given some of</font>

98
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,260
the same talks why are people given the

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,870
same talks and what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean about</font>

100
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,120
our industry so I wanted to kind of

101
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,000
start with where we are today right like

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,050
how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to the spot that we're in</font>

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,050
so we're in Austin right

104
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,800
but in order to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out like</font>

105
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,090
where we're at conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> wives and</font>

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,170
people who are sitting here<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font>

107
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">wise we need to kind of know where we</font>

108
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:08,440
came from right so quick history of how

109
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:13,300
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got here at least in my opinion first</font>

110
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,250
anybody know what that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1623 it's</font>

111
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,980
called a pass colon it's the first

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,140
computer we had we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

113
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:24,460
for a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the whole computering</font>

114
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,750
like I don't even computer good we've

115
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing this for a wicked long time</font>

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:34,030
right then then what we had other<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding</font>

117
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,739
machines right we had an enigma we

118
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,409
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it was it was an</font>

119
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,470
enigma right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing cryptography</font>

120
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,840
we had these great computers right so

121
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,200
this is the precursor to the god of all

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,900
computers which was Enoch anybody know

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,700
what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOC is right one of the one of</font>

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first computers that has ever been</font>

125
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,200
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and this is way before</font>

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,580
we had transistors and stuff and IBM

127
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,680
came into the game to take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

128
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and be big evil and then we made</font>

129
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,980
transistors right and from there AT&T

130
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">labs developed those more yeah we used</font>

131
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put wood blocks on things because it</font>

132
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,919
used to cool it how cool is that you

133
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,750
know the whole halt and catch fire thing

134
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,320
was real because there was wood in it

135
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,850
that's a real thing right and then we

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,620
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> speculating okay what's going to</font>

137
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,960
happen with these computer things right

138
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,120
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is a computer well this is</font>

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,549
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer it's a typewriter but</font>

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,190
that's a computer you could bet your

141
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,570
sweet tell X operator it is ok you know

142
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,770
and then then we figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> out we could do</font>

143
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,140
word processing and actually have stuff

144
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,960
on the screen and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got</font>

145
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things called modems how cool is</font>

146
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,390
that we can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

147
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,310
people then we got hard drives we start

148
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:58,409
storing data that we were creating on

149
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,660
these cool typewriters right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well</font>

150
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,170
then what oh well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can go chat with my</font>

151
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,420
family wait a second you mean instead of

152
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:10,820
just taking forever<font color="#CCCCCC"> to download the porn</font>

153
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,620
i could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want a computer</font>

154
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,630
right and then instead of this point to

155
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,000
point piece that we had we got this

156
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,240
thing called email right the UDP of all

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,080
communication right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

158
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,010
some mountain saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got an email you</font>

159
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,159
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what it is but</font>

160
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,539
it's at my desk right and then Apple

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,430
came into the game<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and they made</font>

162
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,100
all these things easy for people and a

163
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,410
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit creepy</font>

164
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,510
right but but really they made it

165
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,510
prettier and and and we became a lot

166
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,730
stronger right we became totally

167
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,620
addicted to this interaction that we

168
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,090
have interaction with machines

169
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,610
interaction with other people

170
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,260
interaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this thing that we</font>

171
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,730
called the internet right now the

172
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,770
internet started off by just being like

173
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,420
a little point-to-point network for you

174
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,830
know the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> in universities to</font>

175
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,290
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information figure out how we</font>

176
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,060
could like bomb people better and you

177
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,290
know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do to get place you</font>

178
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,760
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> information from one place to</font>

179
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,080
another so we didn't have to hire these

180
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,190
huge trucks which you know I'll take

181
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,229
some credit for the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I've</font>

182
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,930
ever done in my life by<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking an RFC</font>

183
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,300
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get can I get sued</font>

184
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,390
for breaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> an arm see your son anybody</font>

185
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,950
a lawyer anybody know good lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz I</font>

186
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:29,099
might need one after this um but we had

187
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,510
these boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we couldn't get</font>

188
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,409
information places so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was it</font>

189
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,179
sprint we had to transfer a couple

190
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,770
terabytes somewhere which back then was

191
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,839
a really really big deal so we had to

192
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,520
hire all these big trucks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go move</font>

193
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,670
data tape somewhere and drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> them down</font>

194
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,870
to Texas from Kansas<font color="#E5E5E5"> City and instead</font>

195
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,880
because I had control of an edge router

196
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,000
I just routed 10 dot over the internet

197
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,110
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked great yeah you can do that</font>

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,360
if you own the edge wasn't necessarily

199
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,810
good but what we went to is we started

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,160
having all of these types of networks

201
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,329
getting more and more connected right

202
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
because people were sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having to</font>

203
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,230
truck their data places and then from

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting all these neat</font>

205
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,880
bulletin boards and from bulletin boards

206
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,100
we started to get chat services and make

207
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,660
it available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mass populace right</font>

208
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,390
so now you didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be as</font>

209
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,689
nerdy you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just roll up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

210
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,550
prodigy and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> bam you were interweb</font>

211
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,960
right you were on the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font>

212
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,000
you got there and it was so cool

213
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,220
right it was so awesome you could just

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,870
internet all over the place and find all

215
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,670
this data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there are search</font>

216
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,500
engines<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came up and search engines</font>

217
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,969
were so awesome because now instead of

218
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">having to find the stuff yourself and</font>

219
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,660
logging into all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers</font>

220
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,370
which you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> or may not have had access</font>

221
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to but it told you how to get access</font>

222
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually now you had somebody who</font>

223
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,969
searched all that for you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font>

224
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,220
right to the data that you want like how

225
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,110
cool is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from a wood block</font>

226
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,670
that did nothing more than punch of key

227
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,300
and output a piece of paper to like

228
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:02,310
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find data anywhere right</font>

229
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,719
trying to obsolete the library by

230
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,089
creating such an information-sharing

231
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,880
piece and it totally took off right we

232
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,760
went into the web from<font color="#E5E5E5"> web 102 web 202</font>

233
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,490
web whatever the hello we are now right

234
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,410
still your dad we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> using all</font>

235
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,330
these social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we can</font>

236
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,600
interact with people real time all the

237
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,470
time every time you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know</font>

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,750
when somebody pooped I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

239
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and if you're too busy doing</font>

240
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,820
other things like playing a racing game

241
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,620
on your phone while you're pooping then

242
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,990
your toilet can tweet to me and tell me

243
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,660

246
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,560
crazy right and then we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing</font>

247
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,959
everybody our identity which was even

248
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,729
crazier now we went from sharing

249
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,770
information to sharing with people

250
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,440

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:58,140
consumer you're the product right you're

275
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that people sell and really</font>

276
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,319
they're just big janitors right all

277
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,640
they're doing is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cleaning up the</font>

278
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:08,580
 so that we can expose ourselves to

279
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:11,670
other people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're left with this</font>

280
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,070
issue right we're left with kind of

281
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,500
being the homeless people because we

282
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,550
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> homeless because we wanted</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else happened at the</font>

285
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:28,110
same time all that was going on we made

286
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">these big bounds and what we were doing</font>

287
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,610
and other people came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with wait a</font>

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,350
second so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does right</font>

289
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:37,500
that's what this internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and computer</font>

290
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,410
thing does but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can it do like what</font>

291
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,070
what does it have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

292
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,870
so you know ninjas pop up and these the

293
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,400
idea of a hacker comes together right

294
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,790
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea from a hacker comes</font>

295
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,449
together comes from MIT but even further

296
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:58,439
back than that I mean lady Lovelace Lady

297
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:01,440
ADA right one of the first programmers

298
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ever existed now I don't care man</font>

woman child really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome but peace</font>

300
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,740
whatever else I mean that's that's a

301
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,720
hundred-plus years ago people were doing

302
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,320
programming to try and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready for</font>

303
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,670
where we're at today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well</font>

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that gets created</font>

305
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,270
there's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bad right we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

306
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,579
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yin yang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world so</font>

307
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,110
there's people that as this is be that

308
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,510
it's being created there's people trying

309
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:30,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it trying to see what else it</font>

310
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,760
can do you know that hacking and

311
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,100
exploitation literally goes all the way

312
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,360
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Enigma and all the way back</font>

313
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">before that to Enoch like that's crazy</font>

314
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think that we've been doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

315
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,140
stuff for this long<font color="#E5E5E5"> and knowing that</font>

316
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things occur yet we're at we're at</font>

317
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,590
today hey we have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> o day</font>

318
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,320
right that's what oh day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh day is</font>

319
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,760
not oh I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> another cross-site</font>

320
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,390
scripting that nobody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> has on yahoo</font>

321
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,340
that's not oh day oh day is finding

322
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,319
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has never been found if</font>

323
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,970
you tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's another buffer</font>

324
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,250
overflow in the product that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

325
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,460
owned a buffer overflows been identified

326
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:14,360
before got it you're just applying it to

327
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:20,280
another application<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is not zero net</font>

328
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,860
right so back then collaboration was a

329
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,060
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it was cool because there was</font>

330
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,950
other people because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was such a</font>

331
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,069
small community people who used you know

332
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,450
people who computer so when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

333
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,580
computer they would computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

334
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,250
and they would learn things and it was

335
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">really great and these societies started</font>

336
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,060
coming together right people started

337
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,430
sharing some of this information

338
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,500
together and it was so awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once</font>

339
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,510
the sharing started and you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

340
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,590
ability to connect to each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

341
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,590
 hit the fan totally

342
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,839
I mean it hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fan we started having</font>

343
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:59,060
conferences like ccc where we could get

344
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,399
together in a room together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all talk</font>

345
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,680
and share what we were doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

346
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,420
talking at people this was a whole bunch

347
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,949

348
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,569
and I'm like cool i'm going to show you

349
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,849
this neat computery thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did and</font>

350
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:12,620
everybody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like whoa we could take that</font>

351
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,360
and do something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know three</font>

352
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,100
days later there was products made there

353
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,629
was scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

354
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,889
people building new operating systems

355
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:20,449
because the stuff they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

356
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:24,259
couldn't even be done yet but they were

357
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:29,709
like but we could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font>

358
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">making her own gangs because hey why not</font>

359
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:35,329
the human existence requires us to

360
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,860
compete<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people we can't just accept</font>

361
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,258
you know oh yeah they're as good as me

362
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,019
I'm as good as them oh no no no no no my

363
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:43,699
clicks cooler than your click right you

364
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,350
have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these different people that</font>

365
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,758
start putting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and in the best</font>

366
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,779
part is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these groups started</font>

367
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,790
putting out things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were available</font>

368
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,790
to the public why because they've wanted

369
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,500
their gang to be bigger they wanted

370
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,389
other people to understand and get

371
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,059
enrolled in this cool thing that they're

372
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:02,329
doing not just allowing the computer to

373
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:04,579
do what it was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but what</font>

374
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">can it do what are the other things that</font>

375
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:07,910
can do right we have these awesome

376
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,370
groups that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting out there</font>

377
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,699
hanging out together every single day

378
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,290
just going what else could we make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

379
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,758
you have an idea awesome let's all get

380
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,000
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how we can make</font>

381
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that thing happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right we love to share</font>

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,500
I mean we love to share so much that my

383
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:26,389
whole life of coming into computers and

384
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,649
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and security</font>

385
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really built on</font>

386
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:32,600
me trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into porn sites because</font>

387
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:38,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were sharing and they didn't always</font>

388
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,550
share the<font color="#E5E5E5"> log on so we moved from some</font>

389
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,519
of that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we realized okay look</font>

390
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,439
not everybody in this world has the

391
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,160
financial means or ability or the

392
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:50,689
lock-picking skills to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a computer</font>

393
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,749
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we went back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making some</font>

394
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these periodicals right all right if</font>

395
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:55,819
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a computer you could</font>

396
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,170
still read about it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

397
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:58,969
internet access<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could still read</font>

398
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,529
about it and learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can</font>

399
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,570
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there today that's totally</font>

400
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:05,220
different

401
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:08,550
we went as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as having manifestos</font>

402
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,880
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this hacker's handbook</font>

403
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,530
there's a manifesto what other group of

404
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,440
i mean i don't think the Crips have a

405
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:20,740
manifesto though they might have just

406
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,490
that's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> nan crip knowing part I don't</font>

407
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,750
know I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

408
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the manifest that was pretty clear</font>

409
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,910
my crime is that of curiosity I am a

410
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,919
hacker and this is my manifesto you may

411
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,590
stop this individual but you can't stop

412
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,960
us all that's something real interesting

413
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,909
to think about in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the terms of today not</font>

414
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about hacker from the negative</font>

415
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,230
connotation that the news has built for

416
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,100
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just in somebody who's curious</font>

417
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,510
you can't stop my curiosity now granted

418
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
we all can't dress up like a monkey and

419
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,300
wear yellow coat and you know do all

420
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">those other things that be curious</font>

421
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:59,590
george but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very least we can</font>

422
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,750
continue to evolve our curiosity we can

423
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:06,939
get together and have camp right<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

470
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,840
continue to force myself into this thing

471
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,429
and we get so worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this market</font>

472
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,860
that's out there in the attachment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

473
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:13,920
this market in the industry space that

474
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:17,309
exists around it that we've polarized

475
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,980
ourselves we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are in it</font>

476
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,160
for the money we have people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

477
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,660
it for the lulz those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't in</font>

478
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,520
it for the lulz they're in it for self

479
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,309
edification there in it so that somebody

480
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying notice to them right they</font>

481
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:34,200
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear someone say their name</font>

482
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,640
that's why they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it that's not most</font>

483
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,050
people who do it to laugh about it

484
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,870
laughs about it to themselves and move

485
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,730
on they don't publish it everywhere

486
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,370
right the vanity of that is what exists

487
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:47,720
we have people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing it on the</font>

488
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:51,989
defense side and on the offense side

489
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,710
right agreed yes no we have defense and

490
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,830
offense agree but we all came from the

491
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,900
same place so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is their defense and</font>

492
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">offense how is how we this against each</font>

493
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:06,380
other right this is how I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

494
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">time I think about our industry right</font>

495
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:13,380
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single time I'm like what happened</font>

496
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,600
we went from<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really digging each</font>

497
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,700
other and really being interested in

498
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,969
what the other person saying to like

499
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,270
well I'm bigger than them so forget them

500
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,460
in their ideas and that that kills me

501
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we went from this I love crap</font>

502
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,679
collaboration and I

503
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:33,339
love sharing information to people to

504
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,849
this this is our motto now and I hate

505
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:38,589
that it hurts me and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that</font>

506
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:40,119
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our motto between everybody in</font>

507
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,089
the room I'm saying this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our motto is</font>

508
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:45,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">an industry that's why a lot of people</font>

509
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">from outside of our industry don't come</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to our conferences right they're afraid</font>

511
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:53,678
of us they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've polarized so</font>

512
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,659
much that they can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us I</font>

548
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:21,939
industry fights itself instead of moving

549
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,319
forward and we're so busy fighting

550
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,759
ourselves that we're forgetting our

551
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:30,879
goals do any of you guys see that yeah

552
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,249
word I need to hear people say yeah

553
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:34,569
because sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe it</font>

554
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:36,369
sometimes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe people just don't</font>

00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:37,840
see this and I'm the asshole in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font>

560
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,159
ways that we can fix it and go through

561
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,630
it because if you're gonna give a talk

562
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,600
you have to have call to actions right

563
00:23:52,630 --> 00:24:01,000
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint book that I read</font>

564
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,570
oh I didn't read it I'm like all right

565
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,669
my first<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is offensive security</font>

566
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:11,168
versus defensive security<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I I have</font>

567
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:12,309
trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things sometimes because</font>

568
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:14,770
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> real smart I didn't go to</font>

569
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">college well I don't even computer good</font>

570
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> con about that quick but I use</font>

571
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,320
the dictionary a lot when I can't figure

572
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,789
things out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't figure out why</font>

573
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,029
offensive security and defensive

574
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:30,700
security were different can't figure it

575
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:33,250
out so I go into the dictionary

576
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,039
offensive calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to feel deeply</font>

577
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:39,730
hurt upset or angry granted some people

578
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:42,760
in our industry that's their goal if

579
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:46,539
that is your goal at least be clear

580
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:49,779
about your intentions like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't need</font>

581
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:51,879
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear you trolling somebody for the</font>

582
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,010
sake of trolling and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having someone</font>

583
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">else listen to that conversation that's</font>

584
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,190
not in our industry and being like why

585
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,600
should I ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to a security</font>

586
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,970
person all they do is bitch at each

587
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,379
other you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's why we don't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

588
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of traction because we bitch at each</font>

589
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,029
other so much that our reputation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

590
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,919
horrible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

591
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:10,330
reputation is horrible why because there

592
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,799
aren't a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> jobs at every</font>

593
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,178
single company having security people

594
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,129
because they don't think we provide

595
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,770
value why because we're too busy

596
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:22,500
bitching at people instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

597
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:26,610
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> go forward so offensive okay</font>

598
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,110
actively aggressive attacking really

599
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,080
anybody in actively aggressive attacker

600
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,610
oh now you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say it but</font>

601
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,649
before if I was given a hacking talk

602
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:40,139
you'd be like hell yeah all right at

603
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:46,149
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I throw down oh now it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

604
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:48,820
an attacking military campaign<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll</font>

605
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:51,158
accept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sure</font>

606
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,658
but are any of you military hackers I

607
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,480
mean if you are you don't have three

608
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:57,130
you're not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hand but we</font>

609
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">know who you are you look like a bud we</font>

610
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,210
can walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's fine you know like you</font>

611
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,320
have a better haircut we're shaggy I get

612
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:09,340
it but but there's nothing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

613
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,470
that fits a pen tester or a knapsack

614
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,870
person or somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> does code review</font>

615
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:17,980
or even somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who does exploit</font>

616
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,219
development none of that fits all right

617
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:24,779
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> what security a state from</font>

618
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:28,000
being free of danger or threat cool a

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,519
private police force are you the private

620
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,070
police force you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

621
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,860
those words that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a difference</font>

622
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:41,110
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make a difference they</font>

623
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,969
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us but they do three a thing</font>

627
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,929
really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we do any of those things</font>

628
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:58,659
what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is number one</font>

629
00:26:54,929 --> 00:27:01,029
inspire a state of being free from

631
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:06,039
ones doing that right if you're a pen

632
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:09,519
tester and you say you're an attacker

633
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:12,460
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> full of attackers have</font>

634
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,350
malicious intent so if you're a pen

635
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,029
tester you can't have malicious intent

636
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,459
you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

637
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:20,559
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a final</font>

report that gives people recommendations

639
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:28,389
on how to get better right that's what

640
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,850
we do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing world that's what</font>

641
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:34,178
we do a lot of times when we're finding

642
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,469
bugs when we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for issues we're</font>

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:37,059
not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sake of</font>

00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,399
finding it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing it and then just</font>

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:41,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">trouncing someone laughing at them as</font>

646
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:43,418
they go out of business I mean that's

647
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:47,049
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very profitable model I mean I</font>

648
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:50,860
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has that model but you</font>

649
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:54,070
know they're different right but most of

650
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,899
us don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really operate that way most of</font>

651
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">us are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it with the good intentions</font>

652
00:27:55,899 --> 00:28:01,299
and rightfully so of making fleeces more

653
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,580
secure now guess what defense defense

654
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,610
the action

655
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,408
defending or resisting attack right or

656
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,668
the case being presented by behalf of

657
00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:11,490
the party being accused of suit a

lawsuit<font color="#CCCCCC"> or being accused or sued by a</font>

659
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:18,779
pen tester right because they think

660
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:21,630
they're an attacker or one or more

661
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,070
defendants in a counselor right you're

662
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,970
the council who protects your company

663
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:30,600
you're defending it but do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys see</font>

664
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,640
where I'm going that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> offensive</font>

665
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,789
security people who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been polarized</font>

666
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,039
into being the offensive group and the

667
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:45,450
defensive group have the same exact

668
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:47,760
common goal yea<font color="#CCCCCC"> or no and tell me I'm</font>

669
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:53,960
wrong please because I need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell me why anyone</font>

671
00:28:53,960 --> 00:29:00,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common goals right we have</font>

a common goal of fixing the enterprise

673
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,080
we have a common goal of protecting the

674
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:08,429
person the people our grandmother

675
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,590
whoever else and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> assess what</font>

676
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,600
that common goal is and figure out how

677
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">do we all get to that common goal I may</font>

678
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">be better at breaking into a building or</font>

679
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:19,379
exploiting something then somebody else

680
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,090
who's better at<font color="#CCCCCC"> AB sec then somebody</font>

681
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,179
else is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at building and designing</font>

682
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,639
firewalls or architecture or IDs or

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,320
making things or looking at logs or

684
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:30,750
building servers or building hardware's

685
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,928
but all of us have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same exact common</font>

686
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:37,049
goal sometimes that common goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

687
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,580
make money but I don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

688
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,289
the heart of everybody in this room that

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're here just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money otherwise</font>

690
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,580
you wouldn't have spent your time today

691
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,690
to go to a conference I mean maybe you

692
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:50,658
would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to get there for work</font>

693
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:52,529
but I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that plenty of times but I</font>

694
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:55,320
think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a</font>

695
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:58,169
common goal and that all of us can

696
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,149
benefit by pushing forward to that goal

697
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and stopping the bitching of who does</font>

698
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:04,260
what or<font color="#CCCCCC"> offences harder defenses harder</font>

699
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,149
I have more passion you have more

700
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,190
passion my penis is bigger you know

701
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:12,389
whatever right we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait to cut</font>

702
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,040
that out because it's hurting

703
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:15,560
us

704
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,470
our industry grows every single year and

705
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:22,070
it's growing leaps and bounds we have a

706
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,880
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single day of</font>

707
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:28,399
the week worldwide you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

708
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,480
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day or more we have a</font>

709
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,250
security conference I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

710
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,230
worst stitch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vich ever we've never</font>

711
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,050
created anything by stitching but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

712
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,910
pitching a whole lot so we need to get

713
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,610
our common goals together we need to

714
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,230
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that language is a thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

715
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,389
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something did a study recently</font>

716
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,310
saying that over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of a day</font>

717
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,810
you'll hear upwards of 15 different

718
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:57,710
languages no matter where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that</font>

719
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:59,330
could be coding that could be phone that

720
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,430
could be messaging that could be

721
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:04,730
dialects it could be different root

722
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,580
languages but we hear 15 different ones

723
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:10,340
and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that starts to become is</font>

724
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,080
that everybody is starting to say the

725
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,179
same thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't doing</font>

726
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,399
translation well we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning the</font>

727
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,500
other language well and we need to

728
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">assess in what language is going on and</font>

729
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,070
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we bridge the gap do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

730
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,200
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have somebody that's a good</font>

731
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,909
translator can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I learn about the way</font>

732
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they speak or what that language is</font>

733
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,690
in order to try and figure out what our

734
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,730
common goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so then we can</font>

735
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:37,250
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> move past this instead of letting</font>

736
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:40,070
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> via our barrier right find your</font>

737
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,370
spirit animal I don't know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> tray is</font>

738
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:45,139
but Trey<font color="#CCCCCC"> made me laugh terribly when he</font>

739
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:49,370
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave Marcus was a spirit</font>

740
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:51,800
animal Dave's a big dude and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

741
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:55,010
know if I mess with Dave very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much but I</font>

742
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:58,370
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to but within this I mean</font>

743
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,830
there's such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> breath of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spirit animals</font>

744
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:04,429
that you can follow to try and see how

745
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,860
that transition gets made right you have

746
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:08,870
people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan gear who is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of most</font>

747
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:12,139
eloquent speakers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I've ever</font>

749
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,970
how to follow someone like that because

750
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,139
of how smart that dude is like he's not

751
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,370
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your spirit animal you're gonna</font>

752
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,260

753
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,649
idiot like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and then like work your</font>

754
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,070
way up right you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Robert</font>

755
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:31,070
if people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gorman or teen</font>

756
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,870
Marcus<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heldman or kelly vista or Dave or</font>

757
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,399
Wendy or bill I mean there's there's

758
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,649
these little spirit animals everywhere

759
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,270
and they sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stage to try and say hey</font>

760
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how I communicate about things</font>

761
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like yeah like that talk and</font>

762
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,639
they resonate with you and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

763
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,470
identify what in that language patterns

764
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,150
different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other people and I</font>

765
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,500
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you'll find out is that even</font>

766
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,930
though we all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different delivery</font>

767
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,610
we're all part of the same goal we're

768
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,770
all just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the damn ball</font>

769
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,350
forward and play and Sisyphus and having

770
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,090
that roll back over us at

771
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,459
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day we're like come on a</font>

772
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">little hill again right and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

773
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,360
going to stop I I might be bitter but

774
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stop trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

775
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think all of us in our enterprises</font>

776
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,270
and all of us when we're doing our job

777
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,500
need to be really cognizant of the

778
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,900
language of the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were working</font>

779
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">with and the people that were trying to</font>

780
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">peer with and figure out how do we get</font>

781
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,480
commonality how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get language</font>

782
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,040
figured out you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got an</font>

you treated your kids is that how you

853
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:38,510
are as an educator and she just did one

854
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:41,990
of those but like<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAT back down and it</font>

855
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:44,390
forced us into this horrid tirade of how

856
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,779
these communication things around us

857
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:50,540
exist and how a lot of this is us just

858
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:53,780
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking care of the people around us</font>

859
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,210
and why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start changing our</font>

860
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,480
strategies around that and that every

861
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">single time the words that are spoke I</font>

862
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,510
mean to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as controversial as it could</font>

863
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,368
be I mean that's the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

864
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,190
conflict and religion that's the reason

865
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people conflict in race or in</font>

866
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,830
sexuality or anything else because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

867
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,170
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it alive with our language we keep</font>

868
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,850
the segregation there oh you're a user

869
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,609
I'm not a user you use a

870
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,930
computer you're a user so talk

871
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:27,980
about the users but you're saying that

872
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:30,950
you do dumb too you're a user right

873
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,600
and and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start bridging the</font>

874
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,890
gap to that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say look all</font>

875
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,830
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they fall down all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the place</font>

876
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:39,680
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it better ask them</font>

877
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:42,259
well surprisingly enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask people</font>

878
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,700
questions they give the answers you

879
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,780
don't have to just assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

880
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">smarter than them and that you know</font>

881
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,960
what's best<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them and then get</font>

00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:59,150
language and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them all they had was</font>

the realm of well people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to do</font>

906
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,890
dumb stuff and we have to protect them

907
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,420
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we do and then if</font>

think that we need to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1048
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,010
system how could I not understand it we

1049
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,870
obviously have some common<font color="#E5E5E5"> path in there</font>

1054
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:45,360
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to educate and not adjudicate we</font>

1055
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop judging people oh they're</font>

1056
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,460
dumb really every time you point<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1057
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,840
finger at somebody you have at least

1058
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,200
three fingers pointing back at you

1059
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,590
unless you have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things cut off</font>

1060
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:02,970
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're liar thief and probably</font>

1061
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:05,160
both so we need to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

1062
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,930
aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it sometimes back in</font>

1063
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,430
the day when all this was building a lot

1064
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,629
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't get it and they</font>

1065
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,700
couldn't because it wasn't accessible

1066
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,800
but now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many things are accessible</font>

1067
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,419
and we have the ability to read through

1068
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">these languages and find some of these</font>

1069
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:20,220
commonalities that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to</font>

1070
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,629
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> things if all we do is put some</font>

1071
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,240
effort towards it all we do is put our

1072
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,920
heart into it instead of our mind or you

1073
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,979
know whatever we think carries us

1074
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,470
forward as our ego or how tough we are

1075
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">who we are if we could go and try and</font>

1076
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:36,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">attach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the energy of people actually</font>

1077
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">enjoying it man this would be a fun</font>

1078
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:42,560
profession to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in again drop people</font>

1079
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:45,420
knowledge don't just drop o day on them

1080
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,770
right you drop a note a on them you're

1081
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,530
doing it publicly you're doing it

1082
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:53,220
because you're vain you that's my

1083
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:55,530
opinion I don't care any other way if

1084
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,970
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to go get the press go get</font>

1085
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,000
the press please don't say you're part

1086
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:02,430
of my industry because my industry here

1087
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,250
to help people it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

1088
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:09,419
talk and kick their puppy most of

1089
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:12,060
all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to believe that we can fix</font>

1090
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we believe we</font>

1091
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,799
can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and its really easy stuff</font>

1092
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:20,580
it's easy stuff it's us taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1093
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,130
out of our day to not be right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept</font>

1094
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,080
that we'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy than just be</font>

1095
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,260
right because a lot of times we pick

1096
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">being right to be safe instead of just</font>

1097
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">throwing it out there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and go and you</font>

1098
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:36,690
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what show me maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

1099
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you're showing me maybe</font>

1100
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,130
we don't need to have this Chinese wall

1101
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,570
up anymore maybe we can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

1102
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,430
together being on totally different

1103
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,860
sides of things and figure out a

1104
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:49,190
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's way greater than the sum</font>

1105
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,190
of its parts

1106
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,890
sit

1107
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,000
and that is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little spark that</font>

1108
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:09,630
starts the fire that makes that

1109
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,250
passionate change in my opinion if this

1110
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,990
is a lemon market and we have an

1111
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,520
inappropriate and aboard an amount of

1112
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,259
knowledge on the topic versus someone

1113
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,080
else and they need an indicator in order

1114
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,540
to feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that that may</font>

1115
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,279
be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those indicators</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist but we</font>

1116
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,350
need to help them find the right ones

1117
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,390
like if it's a if I'm a mechanic and

1118
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:29,190
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying a shitty used car I'm not</font>

1119
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,569
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to tell you why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1120
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,680
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rings are up in the car</font>

1121
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,390
