00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,579
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Who am I I've been at Rackspace since</font>

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:23,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">October 2011 so I've had three years a</font>

3
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,669
track and most of this is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

4
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the experiences I had Iraq some</font>

5
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:28,140
of this is pre that but it's mostly that

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,550
I'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> senior product security engineer</font>

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,630
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product security group are</font>

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,360
actually now we're called security

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering I think we report up through</font>

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,280
the QE structure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> products so the bit</font>

11
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,870
of rack that makes our cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> product we</font>

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,149
work in that group with the developers

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,489
and the other teams and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> others</font>

14
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,100
half of me i guess my bipolarness<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

15
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,559
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very involved in hola spa since</font>

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,629
2008<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a project called the live CD</font>

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,190
which is morphed into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS WT which</font>

18
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:58,300
is a vm and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole bunch of Debian</font>

19
00:00:54,190 --> 00:01:00,339
packages to install Oh application

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,078
security tools i'd like to refer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,460
as my gateway drug to app set because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,590
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as simple as</font>

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,910
possible so if you have an inkling you

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,200
can get in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door easy and hopefully</font>

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,300
get hooked because there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough of</font>

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:17,979
us there's close to another lesson

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:20,140
that's me so dev ops ii I api's oh my so

28
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,910
just so we're level setting I don't

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,160
really need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this here in this</font>

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,110
venue really but<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps right it's a</font>

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,979
combination of traditional or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,709
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away from the traditional</font>

33
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,030
throw over the wall development model

34
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,250
where you actually have developers and

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,569
ops people working together

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,459
collaboration is huge culture is huge

37
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,500
agile development with sprints and

38
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:40,420
scrums and stand ups and all that good

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,340
stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a release coordination is a</font>

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,259
big deal right but we all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> note</font>

41
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps right anybody confused now we're</font>

42
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:48,970
good right good and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> just in case</font>

43
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd use these acronyms this is what i</font>

44
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,989
mean by the mci for continuing

45
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,489
integration I've heard CD used as both

46
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:56,080
deployment and your continuous

47
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,050
deployment in today's delivery they're

48
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,629
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing ish TDD is trust</font>

49
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,640
test driven development and then API

50
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:06,450
application programming interface right

51
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're done with all the boring stuff</font>

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the problem so cycle time for</font>

53
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:14,709
software is ridiculously short our most

54
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,540
aggressive group at Rackspace in terms

55
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,970
of pushes to production code pushes to

56
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,420
production I think average 75 per week

57
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:24,250
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year so if you think you</font>

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,019
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a testing window it is really</font>

59
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">really small and forget it anyway right</font>

60
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,650
so like<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our most aggressive</font>

61
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,550
group and there's a range at Rackspace

62
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,900
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen</font>

63
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,370
really speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you will not have</font>

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,810
the traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to waterfall</font>

65
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,250
approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to have a week to</font>

66
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,490
do my security testing like that just

67
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,980
doesn't exist now then quite honestly

68
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,810
for most particularly forward-thinking

69
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,840
shops anyway continuous delivery as a

70
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,190
goal right time to market is huge and

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> fighting the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business if you</font>

72
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,090
want to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be a roadblock</font>

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,320
or even a speed bump right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

74
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,430
will lose you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to convince the</font>

75
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,410
business it doesn't want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

76
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,380
market fast and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work</font>

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,520
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> however he said this kind of</font>

78
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,680
scanning widows<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just not viable</font>

79
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:07,200
they're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you have to do</font>

80
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">something different so slow slide thing</font>

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,280
more of the problems right even in

82
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,620
traditional waterfall shops which is

83
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,240
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started years ago there was</font>

84
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,220
hardly any time to test my favorite

85
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,120
story about this was i saw a Gantt chart

86
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,340
of the software this one bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,530
going out the door and I saw security

88
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,570
testing and I'm like ooh I got a line on

89
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,040
the Gantt chart like and I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

90
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,720
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 days so it was something but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,400
wasn't much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right so like</font>

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,220
even in waterfall which is what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was kind of doomed so forget</font>

94
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,190
it you know DevOps in continuous

95
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,110
delivery even makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worse right</font>

96
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're 0 days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes negative 3 days or</font>

97
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,030
something like that if to do some time

98
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,590
time crazy make time math and then you

99
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,030
have the proliferation of the languages

100
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,800
that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even do static</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis</font>

101
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,560
on right the rubies and the pythons and

102
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,330
the nodes like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to static</font>

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
vendors if you want to see them weep say

104
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,050
all we have this node what do you got

105
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me and they'll go have a squeezy you</font>

106
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,810
know go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next vendor right because</font>

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,269
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't know what to do</font>

108
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,959
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's a hard heart problem to do</font>

109
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:12,790
static analysis on interpreted languages

110
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,320
and then even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do have time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

111
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,079
the automated tools you probably are

112
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,029
seeing some sort of rest api nowadays

113
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,390
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know of a really good tool</font>

114
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,349
that handles rest api's well certainly

115
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,219
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't produce something like a</font>

116
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,840
waddle where i can actually

117
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,360
programmatically figure out what methods

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,030
you have somebody has to read the fine

119
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,560
manual and figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

120
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> api before you can even try to scan</font>

121
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,570
right so it's doomed right it's time to

122
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,460
just wish it all quit now go start

123
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,950
drinking and forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

124
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this we're doomed well it's not</font>

125
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">really true like we have to automate all</font>

126
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,789
the things

127
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,250
and what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is</font>

128
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,380
automating software testing automating

129
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,180
operational infrastructure so the

130
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,340
software checking or hardening sort of

131
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:58,810
status of operational infrastructure and

132
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:01,179
then automated security testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok first</font>

133
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,400
off I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important as AB</font>

134
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,690
sick people I have a background my first

135
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,820
job out of college was actually working

136
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">for an international telecom writing</font>

137
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,030
software in bryan-college station for

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,050
those who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> native Texans you know</font>

139
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,450
that's kind of a Nowheresville and oddly

140
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,360
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our IT or all of a telecom</font>

141
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,070
was in Europe so when I goofed up I got

142
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,060
a pissed-off<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgian calling me at two</font>

143
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:26,560
in the morning because that's when he

144
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,240
was waking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up I mean but so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point is</font>

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,860
I started out life as a developer and I

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,300
think you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

147
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,740
development if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

148
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,420
application security person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

149
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,040
like a hard fact of truth but I mean it

150
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can't talk dev you really</font>

151
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,510
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight ball and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time</font>

152
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us to not only do some depth but</font>

153
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,070
think like a dev right break your

154
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,290
testing into little pieces right like

155
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,940
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how you can do to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

156
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,380
what unit tests you write your unit test

157
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,300
doesn't test the entire app it does the

158
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,440
piece of the app do the same thinking or

159
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,110
have the same thinking when you're doing

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,580
security testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and quad hace this is</font>

161
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,470
threat modeling Kevin talked a minute

162
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,969
ago before me I'm sorry Kevin I was

163
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,550
eating lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and joram had a really</font>

164
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,960
small crowd so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat in his room both of</font>

165
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,220
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> were both of them are my friends so</font>

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be um try to be equal what</font>

167
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,250
anyway Kevin does threat modeling at

168
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rackspace he's fantastic at it and</font>

169
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,120
that's a fantastic tool to use to know

170
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,080
the really important bits of your app

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,270
right you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be time</font>

172
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,680
constrained so do a threat model and

173
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,180
know the really interesting parts and

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,790
there may be some parts you just don't

175
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time for and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right your</font>

176
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,410
resource constrained you have to do that

177
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,820
and then look at the time your tests

178
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,680
take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run and you have to break them</font>

179
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,030
into short and long test right there are

180
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,500
some things that are quick and easy and

181
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can paralyze them and you can put</font>

182
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,100
them into Jenkins or a Travis or

183
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,050
whatever right and there are some things

184
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,060
that take a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is when</font>

185
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,780
are you talking about doing testing

186
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,550
windows right the the short<font color="#E5E5E5"> test you can</font>

187
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">run kind of all the time right take two</font>

188
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,370
minutes to run run it every hour if you

189
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,750
want to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frequency makes</font>

190
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,910
sense those longer test<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you only</font>

191
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,080
run them weekly and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font>

192
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,490
that's certainly better than not running

193
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,289
them at all but you have to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

194
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,480
break up the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of not doing the</font>

195
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,870
everything test that takes

196
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">weak do forty percent of it that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

197
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">do daily and maybe that sixty percent</font>

198
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,539
has to be weekly right there's some sort

199
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,190
of split but you have to really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

200
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,510
like atomically about these testing

201
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:13,950
parts um oh yes and test code needs to

202
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,360
be optimized we can no longer write

203
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,580
those like really got awful bits of

204
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,100
Python or parole or whatever that just

205
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,050
sort of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there may be slow and</font>

206
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,390
ugly I remember one time this is when I

207
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,160
was pen testing but I used a brute

208
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,919
forcing tool that did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lookup for</font>

209
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,840
every request and I ended up making the

210
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,670
DNS people call me and yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that's</font>

211
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,409
um oops sorry but I mean there's a very

212
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,260
unwise test like why the heck wouldn't

213
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,610
you cash the the name lookup on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

214
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,380
first one because you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a</font>

215
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,240
whole bunch of stuff to the same thing

216
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,480
this test<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not written optimally I</font>

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,250
was written very poorly and then smoke

218
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,930
test versus regression test right to me

219
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,700
a smoke test is alike it's fairly saying

220
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,590
it's good you must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this high to ride</font>

221
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,420
right do those as frequently as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

222
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,859
all the time right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> full</font>

223
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,210
regression test yes you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

224
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right interval and do them at</font>

225
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,330
that and I'll talk through more

226
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,100
specifics when I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what we're</font>

227
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,620
doing a track<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so maximize what</font>

228
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,570
you've got right<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people have</font>

229
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,770
good testing or whatever programming

230
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,210
language you're using there's probably a

231
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of security features that you're not</font>

232
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,680
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of or turned on right if</font>

233
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,510
you're using Django why isn't the cease

234
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,820
or token turned on in the config like

235
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,159
that's a duh you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripsey surf with</font>

236
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,140
one config<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit change and Bob's your</font>

237
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,530
uncle<font color="#E5E5E5"> right these are like easy things</font>

238
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,180
that you can fix systemically just by

239
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:32,640
really knowing your frameworks hopefully

240
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rackspace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to say it's easier to</font>

241
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,110
tell what languages we don't have them

242
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,478
do if you're lucky to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a block right</font>

243
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">net or Java or whatever you have an</font>

244
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,450
advantage right you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

245
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,839
know that framework and you should if

246
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,060
that's what you're facing oh yes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

247
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,370
testing perspective make your tests

248
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,660
easily repeatable like as ideally you're

249
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,280
going to find something with the you're

250
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,380
going to find a vulnerability you're

251
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,089
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> report it it will be fixed you</font>

252
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,220
will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to retest that in the future</font>

253
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,570
right that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point all right</font>

254
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it easily</font>

255
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,230
repeatable you're actually hurting you

256
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,610
and the overall throughput of your team

257
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,890
right so these tests have to be easily

258
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">repeatable and easy to understand right</font>

259
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,980
because I'm a test it today then come

260
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,510
talk

261
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,699
conference and some poor guy back<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq</font>

262
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,019
as to retest right and if he can't read

263
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,029
or understand how I did the testing

264
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,300
that's not really useful from a team

265
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,889
dynamic and then make tests abstract and

266
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">combine Ville and this is what I was</font>

267
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,740
talking about long and short running

268
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests right you want to have a a suite</font>

269
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,690
of ala carte tests that you can throw at

270
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,820
apps and pick and choose menu style

271
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,760
right I like these three and two of

272
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:39,269
those and a and apply to go right add

273
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,949
those in to your testing and think about

274
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:45,269
the pipe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX pipe I'm a linux guy</font>

275
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the big thing about the pipe</font>

276
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:50,940
idea is you want to have tests that you

277
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,980
can easily pull data from one it's the

278
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,060
other and have i'll show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> later we</font>

279
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,970
ended up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the workflow in the</font>

280
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,849
product security group sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

281
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,470
engineering group where we have one test

282
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,209
feeding into another we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an entire</font>

283
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,680
workflow going and it's all based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

284
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,109
fact that i have a knows how to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:13,709
be no<font color="#CCCCCC"> south africa see well I'll show</font>

286
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:16,860
that in more detail in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute whoo fun</font>

287
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,000
talking after a big barbecue meal so I

288
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,180
had like this idea of test-driven

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,529
security right so under the constraints

290
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,489
of DevOps and continuous develop

291
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:28,110
deployment or do a delivery right you

292
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,889
have to be nimble you have to be agile

293
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,630
and so test driven design says your code

294
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,279
works when it passes the test right this

295
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,139
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of like I write a test and</font>

296
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,269
then I write some code and I don't have

297
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,220
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the test will not go green</font>

298
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,560
until I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> working code right that's</font>

299
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,139
test different development test-driven

300
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,839
security says you've meet you've met

301
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,730
this baseline if you're green when these

302
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,430
tests pass now it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a full security</font>

303
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,050
test it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ultimate checking of</font>

304
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,609
all bits of the security but at least

305
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,439
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're this high before</font>

306
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,880
you go out the door and I think that's a

307
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,040
key point there's a lot of sort of

308
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,630
security purists let's say oh well that

309
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,579
only test fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

310
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,079
that's terrible well that's 50 more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

311
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,670
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had when I didn't automate it so I'm</font>

312
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,599
sorry I'll take that I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

313
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,130
change so it's a time to mourn we must

314
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,260
say traditional app<font color="#CCCCCC"> sec if it ever</font>

315
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,290
existed it sure didn't exist long it's

316
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,670
gone right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm an advocate for sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

317
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,699
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mentality of how we do app</font>

318
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,439
sec and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to go</font>

319
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:27,319
through the five

320
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,540
ages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grief right in the early stages</font>

321
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,400
right agile is a fad the<font color="#E5E5E5"> waterfall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

322
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,939
the only way to produce good and well

323
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:38,449
maintainable software this is no no no

324
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,130
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may be there you may move down</font>

325
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,140
to anger right there's no way I can test

326
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time frame we're done like one</font>

327
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,580
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking sticky note I'm going to</font>

328
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:48,020
lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right I used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to love one of the</font>

329
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,880
places I worked we have the sticky notes

330
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,800
up on the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I used to say we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

331
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,480
one aggressive cleaning lady from having

332
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,520
our entire development process derail

333
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,440
right oh look at this what did they do I

334
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">will clean this up oh whoops right</font>

335
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,700
bargaining right well I can test of it

336
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,440
in two days I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> after it's deployed</font>

337
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,660
and prod I could test it right you're

338
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,880
getting to sort of get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hang of this</font>

339
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,390
like you're learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

340
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
it still doesn't feel good depression

341
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,770
right after that launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> I updated by</font>

342
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,390
linkedin profile and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from aliens</font>

343
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,400
for those who remember that movie like

344
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,170
game over man game over that's what I

345
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think sometimes like game over we're</font>

346
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">done like it's just a matter of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

347
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,860
till we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get popped and I get fired and</font>

348
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,469
off on another job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess then</font>

349
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,080
acceptance so you should now be speaking

350
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,910
developers like say you know when you uh

351
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,350
when you're working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your scrump can</font>

352
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,270
you add a story to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that off</font>

353
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,740
regression we found in our testing right

354
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be the conversation you're</font>

355
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,370
having right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we reviewed your</font>

356
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,989
deployment recipe and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a pull</font>

357
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,510
request waiting for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change how</font>

358
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,820
you do your deploys you know can you do

359
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,350
that PR for us right that's how you

360
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be talking to developers and</font>

361
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,500
cysts a DevOps people right sis<font color="#E5E5E5"> ops</font>

362
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,660
people that's how they work right now

363
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,380
today you should be talking their

364
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,300
language so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly through</font>

365
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,830
those five stages of grief hopefully

366
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,310
addressing how to secure infrastructure

367
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:13,339
apps and AP is and securing code this is

368
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,280
my take on doing those things so

369
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,080
securing infrastructure hopefully you

370
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,730
are automating how you do deployments

371
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,890
right you have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of chef puppet</font>

372
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,180
salt ansible whatever the next cool

373
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is in three weeks that has a</font>

374
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,589
dot IO address whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you have</font>

375
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,150
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets you automate</font>

376
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,240
deployments in a sane and repeatable

377
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,550
fashion right these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic tools</font>

378
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,960
like from a having been assisted min at

379
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,490
one point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I love these things I</font>

380
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,030
wish they'd existed when I was assisted

381
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,790
min because there

382
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,730
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I don't like SSH the</font>

383
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Machine and VI something and one of the</font>

384
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,350
powerful things<font color="#CCCCCC"> there let me keep going</font>

385
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,610
so for example chef right there's a

386
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,010
couple different deployment models of

387
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">chef</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a system administrator who</font>

388
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,110
writes some recipes you may be a toasted

389
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,610
or private or whatever you have

390
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,950
definitions that know how to deploy

391
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,240
different notes right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can say this</font>

392
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,550
is a web server and this is what it

393
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like and I declare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in chef or</font>

394
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:12,760
salt or puppet or whatever and off it

395
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:15,770
goes so cookbooks shall cook book stacks

396
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,080
playbooks what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> right these are</font>

397
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,840
the the things that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps people</font>

398
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,610
are writing to do deployments this is

399
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,200
where you can actually gain a ton of

400
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,940
traction as a security person right you

401
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,100
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be spending time reviewing these</font>

402
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,470
things and understanding what's going on

403
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,360
whatever fortunately rack we have all of

404
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,010
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you're facing hopefully</font>

405
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,110
it's just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing puppet chef or what</font>

406
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,810
have you but this is where you get huge

407
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd pay back because if I can be</font>

408
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,680
assured that when that<font color="#E5E5E5"> API node goes out</font>

409
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,660
the door it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardened I don't have to</font>

410
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,760
worry if they launched one or 40 or a

411
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,140
thousand of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I don't care because</font>

412
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,290
I've already reviewed this and I know

413
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,610
it's good right this is a place where

414
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,290
you may have to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do a pull</font>

415
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,970
request and say you know I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

416
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,339
makes a functional API node but you

417
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,720
accidentally left who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows directory</font>

418
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">index internet and apache and like</font>

419
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,860
that's dumb we should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's just</font>

420
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn that off right PR request here's</font>

421
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">your change add that into your recipe</font>

422
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,970
we're done and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get extra</font>

423
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,590
bonus karma points like push these

424
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,360
upstream because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't really done</font>

425
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,460
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this but I imagine if you look</font>

426
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,290
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the generals publicly available</font>

427
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,030
ansible cookbooks playbooks whatever

428
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,680
they're probably just enough to get it

429
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,050
up not really get it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure or</font>

430
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">harden right so if you want good karma</font>

431
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,500
points start putting those public that

432
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,750
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do the other</font>

433
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,820
powerful thing with salt puppet chef

434
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,280
ansible what have you is you can group

435
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,020
and tagged servers right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have this</font>

436
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,750
idea of this is a web note<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have idea</font>

437
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this is a worker process or a worker</font>

438
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,490
node this is a database<font color="#CCCCCC"> no this is</font>

439
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,020
whatever right I because i have this

440
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:47,300
tagging<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes the automation Burke</font>

441
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,130
i also have a base well one you can have

442
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">a base set of security requirements for</font>

443
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,740
all the servers but more importantly you

444
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,930
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> customize</font>

445
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,690
and set policy right each server with

446
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,589
the database tag must look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

447
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">period right and now you're actually</font>

448
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,580
tying policy to tags that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

449
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,650
in whatever your deployment mechanism is

450
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,720
right and you can verify against that it

451
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,880
makes life really easy yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt two</font>

452
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">tanks the security requirements ideally</font>

453
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to test the insula security</font>

454
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,610
requirements and you're golden right

455
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,470
this is a huge change because now we're

456
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing the hey it's your time for</font>

457
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,830
your monthly scan and oh god<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find all</font>

458
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,870
these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it'll be another month</font>

459
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,570
before they get fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there just</font>

460
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,320
part of the process automated and

461
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:30,560
repeatable which is beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the</font>

462
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:35,060
other aspect of this and inspector so oh

463
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,430
yes for each group<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or tag right hook</font>

464
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,979
the provisioning so that you know ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

465
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,750
just deployed a new API node that should

466
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,120
have caused an event that causes it to

467
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,400
be scanned somehow to be reviewed right

468
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is idea think about your building a</font>

469
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,350
house right you have a architect that

470
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">designs the built the house you have a</font>

471
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,930
builder that builds a house and you

472
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,860
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an inspector that comes</font>

473
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,439
through and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's</font>

474
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,030
saying this is the inspector right this

475
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,190
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that goes in and says yes all</font>

476
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the you know the plugs are two feet</font>

477
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,300
off the ground and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plumbing is done</font>

478
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,770
with glue and etc etc right these are

479
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,050
just bare minimums but not perfection

480
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> important point right</font>

481
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,510
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go for protection you</font>

482
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:14,119
probably won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you won't</font>

483
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,950
be agile enough but you can have

484
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:17,359
multiple facets security scalability

485
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,340
compliance you can roll all that into

486
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,169
this inspector right and now as you're

487
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,520
doing deploys a node goes up you

488
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,380
automatically check it it's green

489
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,849
everyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy all right and as a</font>

490
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,710
security perverse and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even need</font>

491
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,199
to know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really unless it's</font>

492
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,960
red right so that's another cool feature

493
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,520
of this you you are time constrained by

494
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,740
default really<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security that's just</font>

495
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,240
life so I only want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bugged when I</font>

496
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,770
need to be but I don't want to know they

497
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,870
deployed in API note<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know what i</font>

498
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,760
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know they deployed a broken api</font>

499
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">node right otherwise I don't really care</font>

500
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm too busy</font>

501
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,990
agent one mole through them all so add

502
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,520
an agent to your standard deploy process

503
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,250
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be something you write or</font>

504
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,270
something you buy ideally you want to

505
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,100
read only because that makes this

506
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,360
admin's much happier like what is this

507
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,800
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> muck with my system</font>

508
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,530
that's probably not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good conversation</font>

509
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,840
to have with assisted bit and it just

510
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:14,830
looks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

511
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,959
basically narc on that box right it just

512
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,120
reports to a mothership what's going on

513
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,260
hey this hasn't been patched oh my

514
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,060
goodness I'm running an outdated version

515
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,290
of engine X<font color="#E5E5E5"> right those kind of things</font>

516
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,490
and it wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's outdated it</font>

517
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,200
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say hey I'm running version X</font>

518
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,420
right and you could do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> math to</font>

519
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,960
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to update it put that</font>

520
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,400
into a dashboard right and now you can

521
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,750
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like say oh wait there's a new</font>

522
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,280
vulnerability in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenkins and we have a</font>

523
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,770
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Jenkins out there I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

524
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,660
Jenkins because they're tagged and I can

525
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:43,330
do a policy that says Jenkins must be

526
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,130
greater than X and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden all</font>

527
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,439
the servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are out not outdated go</font>

528
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:48,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">read you know who to go track down at</font>

529
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,110
five you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also play the game but like</font>

530
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,310
gee that's funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group got their</font>

531
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,350
servers fixed yesterday and you guys

532
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,490
still have even touch them<font color="#CCCCCC"> tehe and</font>

533
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,469
write a little bit of politics and

534
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,150
political pressures<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad thing</font>

535
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,470
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can watch that board</font>

536
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:04,810
go green it's a really powerful tool you

537
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">can roll your own there's a vendor</font>

538
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,350
called cloud passage that makes an agent

539
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,990
that does this and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mozilla</font>

540
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,580
has this project called<font color="#CCCCCC"> MIG there's an</font>

541
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,650
open source project called Linus it'll

542
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,000
do hardening checks there's a bunch of

543
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">different tools out there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

544
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">this idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of being able to have</font>

545
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">something let you know that something's</font>

546
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,990
gone wrong right that's much more

547
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,260
powerful than the quarterly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus scans</font>

548
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:28,360
or what have you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then turn</font>

549
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,710
vulnerability on its head right the

550
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,780
traditional way of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability</font>

551
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,850
management is I scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some interval I</font>

552
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,350
print a report and I head it to system

553
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and they hopefully go fix it</font>

554
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,620
right that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of model that</font>

555
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,270
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years well that's</font>

556
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,820
really not very cool particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

557
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,320
system in or from a security perspective

558
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,840
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a decent handle on what</font>

559
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,210
technologies you're using you can take

560
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,189
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically subscribe to all the</font>

561
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,160
vulnerability or an ounce or security

562
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,380
list for those key technologies and then

563
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,180
let your guys go ahead of time hey dude

564
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,310
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know engine X release the</font>

565
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,340
patch for this awful vulnerability you

566
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,408
need to go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right let's go patch</font>

567
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,820
it's completely 180 on when the usual

568
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">model of gosh that's been out there for</font>

569
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,350
six weeks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning it</font>

570
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,820
and by the way it's out of date you can

571
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">roll your own I did this for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while at</font>

572
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,658
one place where I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a gmail</font>

573
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:17,580
account and some filters and it works

574
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and it's awfully cheap I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

575
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,080
flies right under the budget but

576
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,279
honestly Sakuni of<font color="#CCCCCC"> em has another</font>

577
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,870
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will do this for you to</font>

578
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,090
they have like 40 k plus products

579
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,739
they'll scan and keep track of you if

580
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want to do the the baling wire</font>

581
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,659
and duct tape gmail thing but it

582
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,490
reverses that standard you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know scan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

583
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,590
report methodology that I just think is

584
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,730
broken and it's not a good conversation

585
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">with sis it means if you're if you're</font>

586
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,399
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make friends with them like</font>

587
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:42,480
telling them hey your baby's ugly and by

588
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,729
the way I waited a month to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

589
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's not very cool not to mention</font>

590
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,909
if it's a really bad vulnerability it's

591
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,889
like oh god now i go to go to panic mode

592
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,870
right and run around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what do we do</font>

593
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,669
instead you're proactive like hey

594
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,379
there's this ugly thing that came out to

595
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,669
a day how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to handle this</font>

596
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,350
when's your next deployment<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's tune</font>

597
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in next release are you going to release</font>

598
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">on thursday well it's tuesday we can</font>

599
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,970
wait two days no one's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die</font>

600
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,529
right those are the conversations that

601
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,419
are much better to have with the people

602
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,909
you have to interact with as a security

603
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">person then the oh god run around at</font>

604
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:15,539
panic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting old I don't like</font>

605
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:23,820
panicking anymore it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

606
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:27,000
talk about securing api's and<font color="#CCCCCC"> abs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

607
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,889
yeah PDFs are great but bugs are better

608
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,049
like if you're working particular I'm an

609
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:33,539
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if your if your consultant</font>

610
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,039
you will still have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do PDF sorry but</font>

611
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,840
if your internal and you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

612
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the developers you should be submitting</font>

613
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,590
bugs they should never see a big fat PDF

614
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,419
from you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you want to</font>

615
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,279
do it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the XS s into one bug or</font>

616
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,600
each one have a bug that's your call

617
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,820
that's kind of a semantic thing doesn't

618
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,559
really matter but it's a bug right your

619
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,970
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding should be no different</font>

620
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,399
than the functional findings i get from

621
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,960
whatever your quality QA IV&V group is

622
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,939
right it should just be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same this is</font>

623
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,250
how developers deal with things there

624
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,419
are bugs they fix them right shouldn't

625
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,899
be a radically different thing for

626
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:05,370
security bonus points if you have a bug

627
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:07,168
tracker that as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> API because guess</font>

628
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,510
what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> automate right now I can</font>

629
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:13,260
submit a finding boom it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their bug</font>

630
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,700
tracker done security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues around this</font>

631
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,710
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing bugs which is what</font>

632
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,990
we do a track you have to

633
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,250
beware of death by backlog right oh

634
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,289
thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bug we put it in our</font>

635
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,690
backlog and it'll sit there forever that

636
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,279
is problem you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some decent</font>

637
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,080
traction if you do occasional security

638
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,210
spritz if you can talk the team to

639
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,529
saying look this next sprint we need to

640
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,850
just handle these security bugs you can

641
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,200
put pretty good backlog of them let's

642
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,610
just knock all those guys out you know

643
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,559
we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our team members help</font>

644
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,199
you if you need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right</font>

645
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,418
and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning how</font>

646
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,490
the team's treat issues right you need

647
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,870
to understand how an issue functional or

648
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,220
otherwise is handled by the team you're

649
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,620
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and then make sure your</font>

650
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,000
system doesn't interrupt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

651
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it kind of gracefully slide in those</font>

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,730
security defects um thread fix is a

653
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:58,129
really nice tool for pumping metrics or

654
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,220
for collecting metrics and also pumping

655
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,390
your issues into issue trackers it sort

656
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,760
of sits in the middle you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put in</font>

657
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,399
findings in there it'll tie into various

658
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,720
bug trackers push the issues directly in

659
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:10,729
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also tell you when</font>

660
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,809
they get closed which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side</font>

661
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,760
of this loop you kind of need to know

662
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:18,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">when those things get closed and another</font>

663
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why an API is super handy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

664
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reticent we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> negev it</font>

665
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,570
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we did a track that I</font>

666
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,460
think worked really well for each

667
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,600
severity level of severity of our

668
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,669
findings we attach an SLA and the SLA is

669
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,010
well the crucial aspect of that SLA is

670
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,990
it isn't having it fixed it's to have a

671
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,850
remediation plan in place right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

672
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,500
when you find a vulnerability a lot of

673
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">times you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team is</font>

674
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> production schedule and when it</font>

675
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,289
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push and how ugly it's going to</font>

676
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:47,658
be to fix this bug right but at least we

677
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a plan right so we establish</font>

678
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,049
different s la's based on the severity

679
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,760
of the bug on when we have a remediation

680
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,168
plan right and we can have some

681
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">back-and-forth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the team than decide</font>

682
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,559
what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense and be rational about</font>

683
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,990
it but at least we know look there's a

684
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:02,178
plan and we know that on what is it

685
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">November November the seventh you know</font>

686
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:07,130
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a fix in place whatever</font>

687
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,649
that's a plan right and then you age all

688
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,120
the finding gig in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas that's always</font>

689
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,830
right because eventually a plan means

690
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,989
you have a date at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least a tentative</font>

691
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,879
date but a date then you begin to

692
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:18,409
politely warn people when you get close

693
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,140
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> those s la's head of your five days</font>

694
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:23,450
out hey you're a week out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

695
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,770
they get really close you can kind of

696
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,570
play the hard game and walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the org</font>

697
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,490
chart right first you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the project</font>

698
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">manager or the dev manager maybe then</font>

699
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> project manager</font>

700
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">their director and then the VP right you</font>

701
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,929
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking up the org chart for those</font>

702
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,830
people who don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play the game</font>

703
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,030
and then bonus points if you get a

704
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,860
dashboard right because you can start

705
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">having this of like GE this one team is</font>

706
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,209
the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always got high level of</font>

707
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,350
bugs I would say though if you're going

708
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:49,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this particularly walking up the</font>

709
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,520
org chart make sure you have management

710
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">buy-in for that because that can get</font>

chart without the org chart people

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and influence people that</font>

720
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,090
plus automation so pick a markup

language I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font>

whatever they like writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> text I like</font>

725
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,850
writing plain text I like a simple

want to write stuff down quickly in a

00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,160
text editor right well fine if you've a

<font color="#CCCCCC">marked down you can make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

730
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,030
text into whatever you want right things

731
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,250
like pan doc will take mark down or

732
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ascii document PDFs or docx files or</font>

733
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,660
whatever you want right done so don't

734
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,490
spend your time trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

735
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,720
pretty report as you're recording those

736
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,790
vulnerabilities just write it in a

737
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,460
markdown the other cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do</font>

738
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,990
with that markup language is take that

739
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,670
markdown language read it in to shove it

740
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:59,670
into a bug tracker right because it's

741
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:01,620
possible by design and then for testers

742
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,780
you inevitably will have boilerplate

743
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,939
text right cross site scripting is when

744
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,470
blah blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

745
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,870
written that a gazillion times in my

746
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,030
testing career and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I shouldn't</font>

747
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:14,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to write it more than once right so</font>

748
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,860
use boilerplate items so that as a

749
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,680
tester really all I should be reporting

750
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,320
is the systems that had it an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example or</font>

751
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,780
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of where it is and then</font>

752
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,939
they you should well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need to</font>

753
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> impact written it in the context</font>

754
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,970
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that app right because cross-site</font>

755
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,980
scripting and a pay may not be as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

756
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,900
cross that script you can that be but

757
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,790
the reference is and the what it is all

758
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,060
that's boilerplate like don't write that

759
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:40,800
more than once ever if you can avoid it

760
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,879
then take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your new findings and turn</font>

761
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,139
those into templates right so

762
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,450
you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write the first time you</font>

763
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,740
find cross-site scripting but the second

764
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you just reuse that boilerplate</font>

765
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,620
done and then write a web app or well if

766
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,030
you want to use a web app or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

767
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,159
to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> it consistent we started with</font>

768
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,560
dradis your dradis ever you say that

769
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,720
tool the problem is that that doesn't

770
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,010
constrain you how you do markup you have

771
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,130
to trust everybody to write markup

772
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,110
consistently that's not an absolute

773
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,660
position so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up writing our own</font>

774
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,360
web app where the developers are our

775
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,460
exclusive developers the product

776
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,320
security team can type in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

777
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they automatically become templates</font>

778
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,460
for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you have that issue</font>

779
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:23,320
done and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a system to</font>

780
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,400
make it blessed right so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

781
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> become templates have to be</font>

782
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,720
approved by a senior person before they

783
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,560
actually are used by junior people but

784
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,900
that's all something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do with the</font>

785
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,510
template right so now like cranking out

786
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,450
vulnerabilities is fast I put them into

787
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:40,240
a web app that get dumped into the the

788
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,710
bug tracker and done very little action

789
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,750
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little interaction with other</font>

790
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,040
systems and copying and pasting and all

791
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,210
that mess that used to have to do when

792
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had doc files and junk like that</font>

793
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay leverage existing consistencies so</font>

794
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,620
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just keeping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your eyes up for</font>

795
00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:00,760
any way that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> automate things and</font>

796
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,679
wherever they are find your paper cuts

797
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,140
and write simple stupid scripts to get

798
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,700
rid of those paper cuts so we don't do

799
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,980
this a track but I did it previously at

800
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,380
another place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did pen testing we</font>

801
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,600
a standard layout of how we saved the

802
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,430
files per engagement we just created a

803
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,439
zip of that layout and you'd unzip it

804
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,150
and rename it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client named done</font>

805
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,700
right my file layout is the same every

806
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,620
time new client copy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> zip unzip it</font>

807
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,710
rename the directory the clients name

808
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,899
done push those to the file server when

809
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,390
you're done testing everybody's client

810
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,010
directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure is all the same</font>

811
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:35,020
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to mine or his or</font>

812
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,520
anybody's Clyde directory and find where

813
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,680
the end map results are what happened

814
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,720
right and it's a stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> little thing a</font>

815
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,200
zip file but it saved ridiculous amounts

816
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,560
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then automate the directory</font>

817
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,700
so the drudgery so automate bug finding

818
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> submission already talked about this</font>

819
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,630
you have an API to your bug tracker<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

820
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,919
should be submitting with that right you

821
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,370
should push a button and the boat should

822
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,410
go in done

823
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,149
PDF report generation we do this every

824
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,520
once in a while for<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly for political</font>

00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,070
reasons a track<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have met and mark down</font>

826
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,900
we use a ski doc I just convert that a

827
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,879
ski doc to PDF and I have a report done

828
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,320
like I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do anything pull</font>

829
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,809
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings that are already in a</font>

830
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,669
ski talk glue them together and turn it

831
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:20,220
into a PDF report done Oh API

832
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:23,160
documentation to basic test harness this

833
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a brilliant idea for one of my</font>

834
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-workers Michael who for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> openstack</font>

835
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,210
they don't produce waddles and waddles

836
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,190
always say these are the methods with

837
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,710
this rest api right so we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

838
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,220
good programmatic way to write methods

839
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:40,170
to talk to different api's but the

840
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,150
documentation for<font color="#CCCCCC"> openstack is generated</font>

841
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,800
which means it's consistent so we

842
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually wrote a screen scraper for the</font>

843
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">openstack documentation that would take</font>

844
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,890
that screen scrape and turn it into stub

845
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,040
methods of all the method calls of that

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">api we were testing did it work no but</font>

847
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,420
it gave me boilerplate code in 30

848
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,159
seconds or less to do all of the methods

849
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,660
for whatever a pie we were testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

850
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,790
mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Savior right because</font>

851
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,830
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were just manually one by one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay do</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> create server method okay do the</font>

853
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:12,360
delete server method to the right done

854
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:15,000
and then oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> well another great one too</font>

855
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,459
um that he did is we found like for a

856
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,720
reflective cross-site scripting you want

857
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,340
to have a test<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us for that it's</font>

858
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">called an HTML page that you can mail</font>

859
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,730
the developer right reflective

860
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,678
cross-site scripting is clicking on a

861
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:27,300
link and badness happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just give</font>

862
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,280
them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page a static web page with</font>

863
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,690
links here's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> test harness when you</font>

864
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,790
don't get alert windows come<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

865
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean there's simple little things that</font>

866
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">are sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these paper cuts you can use</font>

867
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really speed up your process because</font>

868
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,220
you will never ever ever have enough

869
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,050
time Oh sexual output<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine and</font>

870
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,820
convert so I've written a couple parsing

871
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,409
tools to take the output of security

872
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,450
tools and convert them into our finding

873
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,950
blocks right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nessus but I want</font>

874
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to look like my finding blocks I take</font>

875
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,670
the necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mel and bam i generate our</font>

876
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,160
finding blocks yeah you have to tweak

877
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,350
him a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that much right</font>

878
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,330
much better and you'll get like a huge

879
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,550
win from the team because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't see</font>

880
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,379
the this is your Nessus report oh and

881
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your apps can report oh and this</font>

882
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your this tool report and oh this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

883
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,719
your this tool report right you just get

884
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:14,820
a report done

885
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:18,330
it's huge huge win okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoo securing</font>

886
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,360
code they're lyin time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing</font>

887
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:25,649
good perfect so start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

888
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,229
developers these are the dudes and dudes

889
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,880
that's right running code for you so

890
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,340
when you're writing a finding and has to

891
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,960
be detailed enough to be able to

892
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,669
reproduce that issue if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't seen</font>

893
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,080
it for six months right if you're not

894
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing that much detail into your the</font>

895
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,460
findings block you're doing yourself a

896
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,750
disservice right and this is mostly

897
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,240
actually honestly to predict the

898
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,590
security team because I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it and</font>

899
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,090
someone else may have to reproduce it

900
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,590
and retest it and if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't give them</font>

901
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,199
enough detail they're gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

902
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,550
relearn the wheel you know while I'm out

903
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,310
of town or<font color="#CCCCCC"> what have you right this is</font>

904
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:58,530
just good common sense you should have

905
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,629
enough detail for QE to test it and the

906
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,129
developers to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fix the issue and</font>

907
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:06,570
I saw a report one time I loved it it

908
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,430
was a turnaround this well oh yes that

909
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,080
was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love this one the pen testing</font>

910
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,880
report from a company that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

911
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,699
repent test of them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there is</font>

912
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,880
lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> entropy in your session they had</font>

913
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,290
this beautiful 3d cube right cool 3d

914
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cube and they said this is what your</font>

915
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,320
session data should look like there's

916
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,270
all these random red dots this beautiful

917
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,960
3d cube this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you're just look</font>

918
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:30,420
like and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an empty cube well</font>

919
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,070
that's not very cool it really doesn't

920
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,630
mean much now what had happened was they

921
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,280
were incrementing by one the session ID

922
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,810
right session ID one session ID to

923
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,440
sunshine three so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really zero in</font>

924
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:42,899
entropy but this beautiful cool 3d cube

925
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,190
graphic was useless it actually was even

926
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,480
worse because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could vela</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> purrs like we</font>

927
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,810
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I need red dots how do I</font>

928
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,330
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right happy for red dots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

929
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,620
program oh crap like it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> useless</font>

930
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,120
so you need to you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

931
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak specifically to developers on</font>

932
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,729
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know how to go fix</font>

933
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,680
right and then oh I preempted myself I

934
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,010
did this quickie dirty scripts reproduce

935
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,480
issues right scripture reviewssan<font color="#CCCCCC"> api so</font>

936
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,190
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one issue I found in an API a</font>

937
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,780
track where if I sent this one really

938
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,510
crazy malformed request it would die

939
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,100
right and I wrote it was I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know 20</font>

940
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,050
lines of Ruby or something to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

941
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right simple thing well I handed it</font>

942
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,530
to the developer so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like look dude</font>

943
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,270
keep running this until the brakes right

944
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,049
when it stops breaking come get me and

945
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,610
I'll retest right

946
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,350
it's a silly little thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it made a</font>

947
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,428
huge difference identities actually like

948
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right because I don't think</font>

949
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,360
developer teams hand back things and say

950
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:33,340
they're fixed when they know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

951
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,928
they've honestly tried to fix them they

952
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">just may not have the background and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

953
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:41,409
perspective to test them like you do

954
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,480
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's give them some help and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

955
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:44,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">already talked about this right</font>

956
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,419
reflective cross-site scripting and then

957
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:48,668
earlier today James wicket talked about

958
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:52,299
gauntlet which is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic tool</font>

959
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:54,129
to do this automation and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

960
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,239
findings start flowing you will get a

961
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,738
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trading requests this has</font>

962
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:59,019
happened in two different places I've

963
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:00,369
worked at internally you start making

964
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:02,409
findings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> office on the developers</font>

965
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:03,730
like how are you finding this crap and I

966
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,379
don't want to do this like how do I fix

967
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,519
it well this is cool like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll gladly go</font>

968
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:09,969
talk to you now<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's go have a glass</font>

969
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:12,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right let's let's make this stop and</font>

970
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:14,500
then cherry pick what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at right</font>

971
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:16,929
this is another place where threat

972
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,909
models<font color="#CCCCCC"> are your friend find the weak</font>

973
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,530
unclear or suspicious areas a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

974
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,230
times when you're doing threat modeling

975
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,669
you'll get these very parts of it they

976
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,339
can answer very specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we're</font>

977
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:29,500
using Django 3.2 on oh they'll give you

978
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:33,069
all the what's this thing it's the

979
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,190
worker node okay what about the work or

980
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:37,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it does work okay well I know what I</font>

981
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,500
want to test I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to test the worker</font>

982
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,240
node because this guy don't have a clue

983
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,619
what it is right that's the kind of

984
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,629
thing you want to look out for in threat

985
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:45,460
models and then connections to external

986
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,899
systems right or any place where you're

987
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,460
doing format transitions these are

988
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,918
places that are hard to do when you're a

989
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,270
programmer or places where you're going

990
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,649
to make incorrect assumptions i will

991
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,418
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the right formatted data i</font>

992
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:57,368
won't check it I'll just convert it and

993
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:00,009
go right and then you have a bug or a

994
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:01,240
security issue right those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are areas to</font>

995
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,569
look at you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if you have a</font>

996
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,040
threat model the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

997
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,109
you've identified these sort of spooky

998
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,960
areas in a threat model you can do

999
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:12,670
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like flag code changes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1000
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,890
areas so that worker thing I talked

1001
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,230
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any code commit in that</font>

1002
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:20,020
area gets flagged and instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1003
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,520
normal plus 2 which is PR request

1004
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,930
somebody has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on +1 at something</font>

1005
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,059
else has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 it right and</font>

1006
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,578
then it gets committed now it's plus 3

1007
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:29,200
like I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a security review of</font>

1008
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:31,000
this absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've at least had</font>

1009
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,220
three eyeballs look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it gets</font>

1010
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,569
committed and as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1011
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,819
go look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's red flag</font>

1012
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:37,290
right if I have the time

1013
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,440
if it's spooky enough for what happened

1014
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,700
right use the search features that you

1015
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,050
have on whatever code management you're

1016
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,520
using with<font color="#CCCCCC"> humming you can amaze find</font>

1017
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,830
amazing things with like grep and look

1018
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,650
for exec which is sad<font color="#CCCCCC"> but still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true I</font>

1019
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:52,259
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even silly things like that work</font>

1020
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:54,600
and then the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1021
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,610
say this later to is make these systems

1022
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,350
organic like that they can grow over

1023
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,840
time start with the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problematic</font>

1024
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,520
methods we've had ten different people

1025
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,650
make bugs in this method using this

1026
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,330
method in our language we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1027
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,590
to start flagging that because if any

1028
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,000
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> change is happening around that I</font>

1029
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,070
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because we've nub it all</font>

1030
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,600
the time right but you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one</font>

1031
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,640
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have two and then six</font>

1032
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,870
months later you have 12 right but

1033
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of system you want to</font>

1034
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,140
build you don't want to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

1035
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to build the system you can add</font>

1036
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,250
to overtime because you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have</font>

1037
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:25,700
time to build the system but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1038
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:28,500
build one you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep adding bits to</font>

1039
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,390
that was a huge change of mindset for me

1040
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,700
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always wanted to build the final super</font>

1041
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">system and I never had pie and I decided</font>

1042
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,759
that's joke I'm never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1043
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,830
anymore i'm going to build systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

1044
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,390
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to false positives yes never</font>

1045
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,759
never never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a false positive i</font>

1046
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,500
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one false positive is</font>

1047
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,290
worth at least 100 probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand</font>

1048
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,700
valid bugs to a developer right you have

1049
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,710
are you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone tonight honestly</font>

1050
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,359
being the security person going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

1051
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,010
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the developers or on your</font>

1052
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,510
back foot in terms of them believing you

1053
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,520
and if you give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a false positive</font>

1054
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,900
you're already in the doses idiot guy I

1055
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,360
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know help crap</font>

1056
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,280
stupid security people right like no

1057
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,690
false positives please it's so hard to

1058
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,760
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit points with the developers</font>

1059
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:11,130
giving them a false positive is asking

1060
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,950
them to start ignoring you right it's

1061
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,780
kind of unforgivable in my mind because

1062
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:18,629
if you're doing an essay in and you're

1063
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,340
just shipping<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the developers like</font>

1064
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,290
I can probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> train a monkey to do that</font>

1065
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,270
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> blunt right I could probably drain</font>

1066
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,950
my ten-year-old kid to do that like your

1067
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,870
value add is the fact that you ran that

1068
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,310
tool and you verified all those results

1069
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,410
and you're really dang confident that

1070
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,810
there are actionable results for those

1071
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,670
teams if you're not doing that like why

1072
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,770
are we giving you a paycheck to be blunt

1073
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,020
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like I don't understand</font>

1074
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">like any idiot can run Nessus and click</font>

1075
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,220
next five times and print a report

1076
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,840
that's not hard oven then stick to

1077
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,189
differential code analysis this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

1078
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,319
you sort of take your threat modeling

1079
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,599
and your scary parts and then

1080
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,219
code diffs because if you're looking at

1081
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,779
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc between commits it's pretty</font>

1082
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:56,670
easy to see if something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there change</font>

1083
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:58,979
that's important like the scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1084
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,930
work is hopefully 2040 lines of code or

1085
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:02,999
less hopefully big commits maybe more

1086
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,288
but whatever right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily sort</font>

1087
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:06,359
of get an idea if you even need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

1088
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this but doing this sort of</font>

1089
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:11,038
differential analysis is huge because it

1090
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:12,629
lets you quickly tell if I care about

1091
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,779
this commit and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a lot</font>

1092
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,420
of commits you kind of have to do that

1093
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:23,459
or my oh that's five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool</font>

1094
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:25,559
do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to hurry oh crap and you need</font>

1095
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:28,169
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> points with the cred points</font>

1096
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:30,329
with the dev teams oppai it is better

1097
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,519
than wrong right hired befriend

1098
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,719
developers speak their language<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1099
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:37,229
securities that we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that already</font>

1100
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:39,839
today suggests requirements not

1101
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:42,180
implementation this is a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge thing</font>

1102
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,420
right I don't really care this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1103
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,089
easy example if you use tripwire or any

1104
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,499
of the other like file integrity

1105
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:51,449
management tools i don't care i<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1106
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:52,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">need file integrity right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

1107
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:54,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must have file integrity</font>

1108
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:56,430
on the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to say you</font>

1109
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:58,499
must list all tripwire because maybe for

1110
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,180
religious reasons or whatever that ops

1111
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:01,828
guy hates tripwire well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1112
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day I need file</font>

1113
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:05,940
integrity management done right I don't

1114
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">need tripwire so there's a huge thing</font>

1115
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,729
it'll voids of religious arguments oh

1116
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:14,430
and if you can't get language-specific

1117
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:15,239
mitigation suggestions in the language

1118
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,729
that they're written in make sure

1119
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're generic right because if you</font>

1120
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:22,979
give at<font color="#CCCCCC"> PI thong java code examples of</font>

1121
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:24,359
what's wrong you just might<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well have</font>

1122
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:26,308
slapped him in the face like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just</font>

1123
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,690
won't listen to you anymore don't do

1124
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:28,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's bad this guy's does such an</font>

1125
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,739
idiot don't even know we wrote this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1126
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:33,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">Python what a freaking idiot and the</font>

1127
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,369
other cool side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the continuous</font>

1128
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,859
integration and deployment is fast

1129
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:42,299
deploys mean fast fixes right so yes it

1130
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary because code is getting out</font>

1131
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">there all the time that also means when</font>

1132
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:46,319
you find a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can</font>

1133
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate it accurately and</font>

1134
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,859
intelligently to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dev team and get</font>

1135
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:52,019
fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> really quick which is kind of cool</font>

1137
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:57,689
group we were testing with a track and

1138
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:00,420
found an issue hit him on IRC and said

1139
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,430
do there's an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> with x y&z the guy</font>

1143
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,410
to testing ping on the IRC hey what's up

1144
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,330
hey it's fixed dude had even written up

1145
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the finding yet and it was fixed so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1146
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,170
ended up opening and closing above like

1147
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:19,350
that's awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really really cool</font>

1148
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,300
oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you do if you are doing</font>

1149
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,190
this stuff at speed you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to retest</font>

1150
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,100
really quick obviously that was easy I

1151
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:34,920
just done<font color="#CCCCCC"> the test so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are we doing</font>

1152
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:37,230
a track and five minutes or less so come

1153
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,350
on slides here we go so we have

1154
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,390
everything chef puppet ansible salt what

1155
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,460
we do is with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams we review their</font>

1156
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,250
deployment scripts right look at their

1157
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,930
salt chef puppet ansible whatever will

1158
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,310
validate them with the external<font color="#CCCCCC"> boland</font>

1159
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,230
scan so we'll have them pop a note for

1160
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:55,290
us and do a full scan of that and make

1161
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,730
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sane and we'll recheck do</font>

1162
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">rejects if we have any bugs right if we</font>

1163
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,490
go await you free have to turn on this

1164
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,170
configuration setting they'll turn it on

1165
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll recheck right until we get a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blessed sort of config and then we're</font>

1167
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,100
done you know iterate on that until no

1168
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:10,350
problems we're using cloud passage in a

1169
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,029

couple other one off agents to for some

1171
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:17,100
certain circumstances and we've been

1172
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,570
doing threat models for a long time if

1173
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:23,150
you saw Kevin's talk right before this

1174

one we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have how many is it 70 some-odd</font>

1175
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,700
there you go and he has them all tied

1176
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,960
together so you can do like the bouncing

1177
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,310
ball through our cloud this sucks that

1178

that's our workflow I mean it all most

of these steps excluding finding an

ask you doc is our markup language of

1201
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,360
choice to do findings and from there you

1202
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">can create HTML or PDF or doc or</font>

Jenkins integration I think we wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

rain was part of before I got there then

1216
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,610
we gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Vera code and then we're</font>

00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:02,430
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API automation or the API of</font>

API of Vera code to pull down findings

1219
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:08,120
and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into our workflow just</font>

1220
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:10,410
like a normal manual finding we produced

1221
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,710
detail finding blocks and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">do ad hoc scripts we're doing training</font>

1223
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,970
we have e-learning modules we do work

1224
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,790
with devs daily we've I've been loaned

1225
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:23,970
to the the container team since january

1226
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:25,860
of this year we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have DevOps their dev</font>

days<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go out the team will go out</font>

1228
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hide in a conference room and</font>

1229
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,069
knock out tooling because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1230
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:35,550
make that time it'll never happen that's

1231
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:38,490
been a big win<font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaways key takeaways</font>

1232
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:40,050
who I'm good on time<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew automate</font>

1233
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,709
automate automate like find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper</font>

1234
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,000
cuts in program those away and a finding

1235
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,430
workflow you need to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out and</font>

1236
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,140
optimize it ours is really fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

1237
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,120
been a fantastic thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hated this one</font>

1238
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,379
as a pen tester and this is really been

1239
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,650
one of the best systems I've interacted

1240
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,180
with it it's nice and create systems

1241
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,830
that can grow organically already talked

1242
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,870
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you'll never have time</font>

1243
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,819
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write the system but if you write the</font>

1244
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,380
system that's easy to add to you will

1245
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,090
add to it over time I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes</font>

1246
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to add a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new check to this thing that's</font>

1247
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:11,400
easy right and then use your finding

1248
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:13,589
blocks as templates for the next time so

1249
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to rewrite all that</font>

1250
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,640
bloody awful boilerplate and learn to

1251
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,800
talk death right you should you should

1252
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,690
be saying hey i<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent a PR request for</font>

1253
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,210
your saltstack can you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know pit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1254
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,820
for me right as opposed to that's bad

1255
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:29,820
here's your PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cool</font>

1256
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,240
way to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to daves and then asked to</font>

00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be much more like dev team</font>

1265
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,279
and be that agile because we won't

1266
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:49,830
convince the business to slow down

1267

period my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fed just won't happen and</font>
