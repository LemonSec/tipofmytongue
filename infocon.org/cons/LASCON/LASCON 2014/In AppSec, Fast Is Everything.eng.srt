1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:26,540
thanks that I centro she uh this is not

2
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:31,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">a basketball this is a basketball coach</font>

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,809
this thing is called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wilson 9450 and</font>

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,300
it's actually I got a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here</font>

5
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:40,260
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got a bunch of sensors</font>

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,790
inside it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this works anybody</font>

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:49,349
know why it's called 9450 fortune on

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:53,879
basketball say again basketball courts

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,589
94 feet by 50 feet so I the way this

10
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,839
thing works is you just play your game

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,570
the normal way to go out you dribble you

12
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,030
shoot whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this thing measures</font>

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,890
everything you do it connects back to

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,020
your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> via bluetooth gives you all</font>

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,110
these heads up displays and analyzes

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,280
your game it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> incredible it's a passive</font>

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:18,270
sensor that measures your game and

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,070
really I I found a very powerful very

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,340
compelling way of doing this kind of

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,460
coaching so this is my my chart for my

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,289
shot and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see 94 50s got a model</font>

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what good basketball is supposed to</font>

23
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:34,250
look like and it says your shot supposed

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,680
to be between 42 and 48 degrees of arc

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,450
which makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turns out i'm</font>

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,829
shooting flat like you can actually see

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,719
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the range but</font>

28
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,279
a bunch of them are flat now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font>

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing basketball 30 years and i didn't</font>

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the kind of thing</font>

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy's like yo man</font>

32
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:54,960
you're shooting flag just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

33
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,579
come up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game that way so this</font>

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,109
actually taught me something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

35
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">been playing with it for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few weeks now</font>

36
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:03,059
and it's it's interesting and I thought

37
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,009
this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way application</font>

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,829
security should be right we don't have

39
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the resources</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give every single</font>

40
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,549
person every single developer out there

41
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,069
a coach to look over the shoulder and

42
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,710
watch how they're playing but we could

43
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,269
put sensors in place that watch how

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,890
their coding and how their application

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,630
is working and alert them immediately

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some cool tools out there</font>

47
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,590
like break man for rails that starts to

48
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,960
get to this model right where you're

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,550
coding what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Flags a problem and</font>

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,930
notifies you immediately

51
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to think about this this</font>

52
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,680
model a little bit and go beyond just

53
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,269
the tool right break me as a cool tool

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,340
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this talk I'm going to talk</font>

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what I call continuous application</font>

56
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,510
security which is the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,700
built around the idea of sensors and

58
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,250
notifying people immediately when they

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,200
make when these mistakes crop up so in

60
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,400
order to do it you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a model</font>

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what good basketball looks like right</font>

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,730
that's how this works you got a model of

63
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,470
good basketball you got sensors out

64
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:01,769
there that are measuring and then you

65
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,080
get analytics against the model that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

66
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,720
powerful feedback loop right and that's

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what we need to be creating in</font>

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
our application security programs that's

69
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,329
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get these organizations off the</font>

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,970
ground and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these apps and programs</font>

71
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving at DevOps speed and at</font>

72
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,840
portfolio scale so I've done a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,220
talks on this topic over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,230
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one there is</font>

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,880
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> security DevOps being</font>

76
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,480
portfolio scale I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did that last year at</font>

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,180
apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> aqsa it talks about building great</font>

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,980
application security sensors so changing

79
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,530
from the idea of having these tools that

80
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,390
you run once at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the software</font>

81
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,070
developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> life cycle to a model where</font>

82
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,750
you've got sensors that are continuously

83
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,160
deployed and continuously gathering data

84
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,600
that's the first thing then I talked in

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,890
about six months ago I did a talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">building an application security sensor</font>

87
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,700
network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more of a practical</font>

88
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,459
talk what I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how do you</font>

89
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,959
manage a whole army of sensors that are

90
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,770
out there instrumenting your software

91
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,260
development organization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I built</font>

92
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,020
some infrastructure using puppet and our

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,579
sink and custom dashboards and put

94
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,920
something kind of nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> together for this</font>

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's powerful and I'll expand</font>

96
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,349
on that a little bit today but i wanted

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,029
to zoom back and look at how we're doing

98
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,739
application security for the most part

99
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:22,289
and this is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of the</font>

100
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,590
model that's enshrined in the maturity

101
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,510
models or you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big big scale</font>

102
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,700
kind of absent programs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

103
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,409
we're doing it wrong you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these</font>

104
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,090
programs you see a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

105
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,470
applications being developed in there

106
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,390
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's software relevant</font>

107
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,150
projects they're moving fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got a</font>

108
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,880
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a centralized</font>

109
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC team that forms a natural bottleneck</font>

110
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,290
for these projects right all your

111
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,330
software projects have to go through

112
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> button anybody experienced this</font>

113
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,320
problem where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you've got to get</font>

114
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the experts and it slows down your</font>

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,290
development process everyone gets

116
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,000
irritated and it ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not</font>

117
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">working very well if you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,730
are producing really minimal assurance

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,160
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you get a report with a</font>

123
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,350
few vulnerabilities in it right that's

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,510
not assurance that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough</font>

125
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,770
we're not producing confident that this

126
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,780
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually secure enough to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

127
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,150
into production we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

128
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,849
minimal coverage and buy coverage I mean

129
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,560
both in terms of the application

130
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,000
portfolio like how much of it we can

131
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cover and how much of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,570
vulnerability space we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cover</font>

133
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,180
these programs are under tremendous

134
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,830
pressure to go faster you know if you've

135
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a thousand applications and your</font>

136
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,250
application security team is currently

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,039
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred a year you're under</font>

138
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,290
massive pressure to cut down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope</font>

139
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,930
of your reviews got to do more of them

140
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,200
every day and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting good</font>

141
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,340
coverage over the vulnerability space so

142
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,320
we're not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at rents and</font>

143
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,510
the last thing is terrible process fit

144
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,490
and you know I'm as guilty of this as

145
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,280
anybody I've been doing manual code of

146
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you on manual pen testing for 15 years</font>

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know I think I'm pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

148
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm slow right make a natural</font>

149
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,409
bottleneck and so if I'm involved in the

150
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,440
process like directly involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

151
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,510
process something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong I you know</font>

152
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not doing it right and so the</font>

153
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,050
process fit around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we do</font>

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
application security is terrible we're

155
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,260
pissing everybody off and I think I've

156
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">heard a bunch of talks already today</font>

157
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,030
that if acknowledged this like we got to

158
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,770
do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be good at fitting into the</font>

159
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">process and these projects these</font>

160
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,930
programs are very expensive which i

161
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:39,210
think is another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can work on so</font>

162
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:42,150
let's back up a little bit and look at

163
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,640
the situation that we're in so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Verizon</font>

164
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,799
gbr came out thirty thirty six percent

165
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,460
of the breaches were due to

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,900
application security problems you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

167
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,989
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it as much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear about</font>

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,849
other things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> D dots and skimmer</font>

169
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,860
attacks in point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sale tax and so on</font>

170
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:02,280
but application security is by far the

171
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,319
biggest category of breaches yet when

172
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,628
you look at the spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font>

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">really interesting is you know some of</font>

174
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,900
the analyst firms of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrapped up</font>

175
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,120
to spending the security space<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

176
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">point seven percent of the spending is</font>

177
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,210
on application security that's the amout

178
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:22,289
of whack to anybody I think that's nuts

179
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:28,128
right anybody think of a reason why the

180
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:28,128
spending might be this way sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it oh</font>

181
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,569
yeah some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things do get bigger</font>

182
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:34,680
publicity for sure it's I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps</font>

183
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:37,020
like is a little more difficult to

184
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe but actually think it's kind of</font>

185
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,068
our fault like we've made it very

186
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,509
difficult to spend money and application

187
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:44,759
security because you can't just go buy

188
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">one product you got two dozen vendors</font>

189
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,409
out there that are competing for those

190
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,549
those dollars and<font color="#E5E5E5"> consulting so it's</font>

191
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:55,469
tricky but this is there's something

192
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">very wrong with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture soda think</font>

193
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,219
about a little differently I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

194
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about you know looking at the</font>

195
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">software development organization as a</font>

196
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,940
factory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you've read you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jean</font>

197
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:07,469
Kim's book Phoenix project you'll

198
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,050
understand where some of this is coming

199
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:12,810
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the software</font>

200
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,849
factory its job is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce you know</font>

201
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,819
take business<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs in and produce</font>

202
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:19,229
software out the other end and we want

203
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,440
that software to have certain attributes

204
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:26,460
right we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a secure code</font>

205
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,719
that's coming out and the traditional

206
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,430
way that we've dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this is we put</font>

207
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:30,750
up these these roadblocks in the way

208
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,328
we're say we're going to check at

209
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,219
various phases of this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify</font>

210
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,539
that everything is is on track the

211
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,940
problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it just slows</font>

212
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,409
everything down irritates everybody in

213
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,949
it doesn't end up producing the results

214
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:47,459
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want I like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expression that says</font>

215
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:49,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet sees censorship as</font>

216
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,420
damage and routes around it well I think

217
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">for security development organizations</font>

218
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,589
see delays as<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage and they route</font>

219
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,420
around them right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

220
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:57,990
marginalized because we're slowing the

221
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,719
process

222
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,430
and the solution obviously is to do our

223
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,100
job faster and really that's the focus

224
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,109
of this talk fast really is everything

225
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,060
in application security if you want to

226
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,370
make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference you've got to be in</font>

227
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,119
real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll talk about how you</font>

228
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,500
get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took a look at some thinking</font>

229
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,500
about real factories and how they've

230
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,420
dealt with this problem and it's

231
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,980
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of industries</font>

232
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,579
get to this point where their ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,339
produce product very quickly exceed the

234
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,080
ability to do quality work on those

235
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,779
products right so you can think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,610
auto industry in the 70s we started

237
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,170
producing lots of cars really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast but</font>

238
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the quality was terrible in Ralph Nader</font>

239
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,209
wrote about it and unsafe at any speed

240
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:44,520
lots of those kinds of examples what's

241
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,260
happened in the industrial manufacturing

242
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,050
area is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern factories are</font>

243
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,580
massively instrumented so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

244
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the sensors that you can get</font>

245
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,230
there's cameras and microphones and

246
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,270
vibration sensors and moisture sensors

247
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,740
and all kinds of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

248
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's going on</font>

249
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,720
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> factory they instrument</font>

250
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,040
everything and then those factories

251
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,020
communicate these are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,180
the adapters that you might need if you

253
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,310
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to instrument you actually stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

254
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,890
a real sensor network that all feeds

255
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,209
back so you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these signals from</font>

256
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,500
all these sensors and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring them</font>

257
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,260
together in a programmable logic

258
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,660
controller like this one this is the

259
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,300
model like if this is the sensor in the

260
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">basketball or in your industrial welding</font>

261
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,490
machine or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all those</font>

262
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,899
signals come together in programmable

263
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,540
logic controller and there's a model in

264
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:38,820
there that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> what good factory</font>

265
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,620
operations supposed to look like this is

266
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,910
where the analytics happen right so

267
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,310
we're start to put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> a picture</font>

268
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,870
here right its sensors model and then

269
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,189
these analytic dashboards and then you

270
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,020
can pull all that together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font>

271
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,610
these great dashboards<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that</font>

272
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,910
you understand problems before there a

273
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,890
problem right this is I believe how we

274
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,439
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do software if we want to get in</font>

275
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">front of application security is this</font>

276
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,209
model that feedback loop where we have

277
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,949
sensors compared against a model and

278
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we produce analytic dashboards</font>

279
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,819
against them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk a little bit</font>

280
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,279
about

281
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,439
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going on so one thing</font>

282
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,309
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot is</font>

283
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:19,649
taking a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crappy sensors for app</font>

284
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,389
sack in really noisy sensors they say

285
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,879
well you don't let's do let's cobble

286
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,979
together a few static tools than a few

287
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,229
dynamic tools and we'll smash the

288
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:31,739
results together and will correlate them

289
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:33,689
and we'll get good output and I don't

290
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:35,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's possible I think we really</font>

291
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:37,618
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on super high quality</font>

292
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:39,869
sensors if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this process</font>

293
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:43,639
work I think what you get if you do this

294
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:46,199
is you get a weird subset of the

295
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,549
security data that you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

296
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:52,169
things that you know the overlap between

297
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:54,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">sass and desk is not that great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I you</font>

298
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,369
end up finding a few problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

299
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:58,079
not well correlated and you miss

300
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:00,720
anything that can't be discovered by

301
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,089
both technologies which is a significant

302
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,709
portion of the the security data that

303
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,720
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather so I'm not crazy</font>

304
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,969
about this approach what we need is

305
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,669
really better sensors and I'm thrilled

306
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:16,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to announce a free tool that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

307
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:20,129
released this is the first free I asked

308
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:23,998
tool available it's called contrast for

309
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:27,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">Eclipse and it works differently than</font>

315
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:42,689
burp is a free tool that has a pro

316
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:48,389
version so i got this approved by the

317
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:50,219
board and this tool is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful it</font>

318
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,339
uses instrumentation in a new way to

319
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,720
find security vulnerabilities and you

320
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,879
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download it and install it it's in</font>

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,199
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eclipse market place called contrast</font>

322
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,629
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eclipse and you can just grab it</font>

323
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,279
takes you know 30 seconds to install and

324
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,049
start using<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show you how it</font>

325
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,489
works so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start I'm going to</font>

326
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:12,059
clear this out when you when you first

327
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:14,039
bring it up it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up like this and in</font>

328
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:16,079
order to start it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just instead of</font>

329
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,810
starting your application the way you

330
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,069
norm

331
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,469
they would you just right click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

332
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,090
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hitting start you hit start</font>

333
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,950
with contrast and fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

334
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,260
application so I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've got</font>

335
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:28,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">web code running here with the</font>

336
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,860
instrumentation turned on and all you

337
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use the application</font>

338
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal way you don't have to hack</font>

339
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,440
it you don't have to know anything about

340
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">security so I'll just put last con rocks</font>

341
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,450
here and contrast automatically analyzes

342
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,710
that request in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time and reports</font>

343
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,580
the vulnerability to the plugin<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

344
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,480
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel injection</font>

345
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,460
vulnerability in this page and you can

346
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">double click on it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

347
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,600
line of code you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little risk</font>

348
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:02,140
description here you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the full</font>

349
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,540
evidence so this is each of the lines of

350
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,949
code involved with this vulnerability so

351
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,900
I could go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the top here and say oh</font>

352
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,520
this is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a line of code</font>

353
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,069
where that parameter gets read in its

354
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,400
you can see here it says last con rocks

355
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,950
and we watch that data flow through the

356
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,839
application into the sequel query and

357
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,000
you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lines of code where</font>

358
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,540
that query gets built and then the line

359
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,010
of code where that query gets executed

360
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,829
so it's really got a very rich set of

361
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,720
data related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this vulnerability we've</font>

362
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
got the full stack trace if you want to

363
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,680
for any of these events if you want to

364
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,140
dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that and we got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full HTTP</font>

365
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">request so if you're used to static</font>

366
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,710
tools you're used to getting sort of

367
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,270
that line<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code information you don't</font>

368
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> runtime data flow but you get</font>

used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that line of code information if</font>

370
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,850
you're used to the dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools you're</font>

371
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,760
used to getting vulnerabilities that

372
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,890
look like this a little bit but you need

373
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,270
them both together if your developer you

374
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,350
want to fix this problem you not only

375
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,810
need the line of code but you need a

376
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,940
test case in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify it and test</font>

377
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,219
that you actually fixed it right because

378
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,350
contrast forms inside the running

379
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,650
application we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

380
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you just show</font>

381
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,130
you how it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tell you a</font>

382
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,839
little bit about how it works internally

383
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,520
so what contrast does is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> attached to</font>

384
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> running application server and</font>

385
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,770
instrument the code as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> loads so we're</font>

386
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,290
inserting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know using</font>

387
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,420
instrumentation to hook certain methods

388
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,689
interesting methods to us like we're

389
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,599
quest to get parameter and sequels

390
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:37,060
executed state all those all those calls

391
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,000
we instrument them and then as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use</font>

392
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,040
the application contrast passively

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,170
observes what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't affect</font>

394
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,040
the way the application runs and reports

395
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,569
the vulnerabilities out so that was a

396
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,790
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to pause here and just take</font>

397
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:58,360
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody got questions</font>

398
00:15:51,790 --> 00:16:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about I asked yet right here so the free</font>

399
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,139
this is just for eclipse I mean if you

400
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the commercial</font>

401
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,339
tool that's another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is</font>

402
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,170
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java in Eclipse and you can</font>

403
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,430
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it with other IDEs if you</font>

404
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,170
want there's a way of running it outside

405
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,630
the container and getting the feedback

406
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,819
the same way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just java web</font>

407
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,649
apps and web services any other

408
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:26,170
questions about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> or how this is</font>

409
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:28,120
actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's doing not a</font>

410
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,560
free version there's there's the

411
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,230
commercial tool but no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk</font>

412
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what I'd like to</font>

413
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,920
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is show you just how real time this</font>

414
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,319
is and why this it makes a difference

415
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,870
that it's so fast I've got a selenium

416
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,610
tests we set up here for web<font color="#CCCCCC"> code and</font>

417
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,990
this I took three<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to record this</font>

418
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,490
like you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit the record button and</font>

419
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,459
just browse through the application once

420
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,649
you don't have to put in any attacks or

421
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:55,869
anything I'll just start this and then

422
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can watch the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vulnerabilities</font>

423
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just so this is just executing this</font>

424
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,459
is just executing web go you know at

425
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,429
relatively high speed and you can just

426
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:09,159
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vulnerabilities start pouring in</font>

427
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:11,079
because contrast is analyzing all of

428
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,839
that all of that part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the application</font>

429
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,309
that gets exercised in real time now

430
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,678
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a huge difference if you're a</font>

431
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,020
developer and you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

432
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,429
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just test locally you</font>

433
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,990
run your test cases you run your

434
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,669
selenium test suite or you just use it

435
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,980
manually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get instant feedback</font>

436
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,600
about the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're writing so</font>

437
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,210
you can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right then when it's</font>

438
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,280
cheap you don't have to wait days or

439
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,770
weeks as you upload your code or

440
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,178
schedule a scan and get a pdf report and

441
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,119
filter out all the false positives

442
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,440
and get the you know finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the the</font>

443
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,749
folder ability and not have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

information you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to fix it contrast</font>

445
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:49,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in real time I actually I started</font>

446
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:52,309
working on this about five<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and</font>

447
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:53,570
I stepped down as the chair of wasps to

448
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:59,480
work on this because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought this was</font>

449
00:17:53,570 --> 00:18:01,158
such a promising technology and I back

450
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,889
then I was really only interested in

451
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:06,139
accuracy because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

452
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:08,119
everyone really cared about and this

453
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:10,248
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is way more accurate than</font>

454
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,559
other vulnerability detection because

455
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:14,360
we've just got more information right

456
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,029
we've got information about not only the

457
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,209
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the HTTP request but we also</font>

458
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">see the runtime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data flow we see all the</font>

459
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,129
libraries and frameworks in the

460
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,720
application we see all the configuration

461
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:28,279
files even all the back end connections

462
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
and so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use all that information</font>

463
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,820
to decide whether something's of

464
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,789
vulnerability or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really only</font>

465
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:39,559
report that the real stuff here<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

466
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:42,860
was really only worried about accuracy

467
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,869
what I found is that the real-time

468
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:46,850
nature of this is actually much more

469
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:48,439
important if you want developers if you

470
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,959
want a real software<font color="#E5E5E5"> process to do</font>

471
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,070
application security for itself being

472
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,240
real time is absolutely what you need if

473
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think about the suffered another</font>

474
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,759
process doing security the way we do it

475
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,320
now is very burdensome let's go say

476
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,929
expensive but burdensome is probably a

477
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">better term because it causes a lot of</font>

478
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,999
effort you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stop and do it which</font>

479
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,490
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are naturally inclined</font>

480
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:15,559
to to not do that until the last

481
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,399
possible minute right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

482
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,320
do it over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and over because it's</font>

483
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">burdensome every time you do it so</font>

484
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,379
people end up pushing it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

485
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:23,869
the life cycle and only doing one big

486
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:26,779
test at the end but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can lower the</font>

487
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:28,699
burden of doing application security to

488
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:30,590
almost zero then you can do it

489
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,809
continuously throughout the application

490
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,480
development process you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in dev</font>

491
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,658
you can do it in CI you can do it in

492
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,730
staging and test and it's actually

493
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">really powerful if you think about your</font>

494
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,059
process wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool if you could</font>

495
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">see hey look here's all the</font>

496
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,580
vulnerabilities that we saw in death and

497
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,159
fixed and then

498
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,889
here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see at the CI server when</font>

499
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,720
we run<font color="#E5E5E5"> our test suite oh look only a few</font>

500
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,340
vulnerabilities got through to here and

501
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you can compare that to what you</font>

502
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,519
see in a staging environment and

503
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,350
hopefully you're down to zero or<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

504
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,090
few vulnerabilities and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

505
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,889
one in staging you should think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey</font>

506
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,959
wait a minute how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did that happen you</font>

507
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,720
know who ignored some staff here<font color="#CCCCCC"> too in</font>

508
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:14,529
order to get us to this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

509
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> track vulnerability production</font>

510
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:20,159
across your software lifecycle much

511
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
better if you can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in real time</font>

512
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,350
it is low so contrast really only

513
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:35,289
reports things that actually happen

514
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,330
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application so when we</font>

515
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,190
see a sequel injection it's because we

516
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,470
actually tracked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

517
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,450
through the application down into the

518
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,039
libraries and frameworks and back into

519
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code and down in the frameworks and</font>

520
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,929
eventually we see it end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sequel</font>

521
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:55,709
query that goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database without</font>

522
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:55,710
going through any escaping<font color="#E5E5E5"> or protection</font>

523
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,949
it does so this analyzes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> libraries</font>

524
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,500
if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the list</font>

525
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,690
here you can see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyzed just the</font>

526
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,309
libraries that are available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

527
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,200
actual running application so we watch

528
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,330
which libraries get loaded and we

529
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,309
analyze them we actually check them

530
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,189
against our database then we see you

531
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which known vulnerabilities are</font>

532
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:20,230
present in those those libraries which

533
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:21,518
is OS a nine if you're interested

534
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,269
something that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an important</font>

535
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,269
thing to do yeah

536
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,600
it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend the rule set</font>

537
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,860
it's not really exposed in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eclipse</font>

538
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,840
plugin really what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

539
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,399
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is you know we're trying to</font>

540
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,020
get people to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

541
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,910
application security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font>

542
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">them focused on you know some of the</font>

543
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:46,170
problems that are really important so

544
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,320
we've you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this covers most of the</font>

545
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">O's top 10 really well and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

546
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,129
to get that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to sort of raise</font>

547
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,830
the bar I i wrote the OS top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 in 2002</font>

548
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,050
and it still got the same stuff in it

549
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,030
which is massively frustrating to me it

550
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,300
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've failed and OS has</font>

551
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:07,830
failed to change the way software works

552
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,120
and I'm really that hurts me so we're

553
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,770
releasing this tool to try to raise the

554
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,270
bar you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you have this tool in</font>

555
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> release soccer with a sequel</font>

556
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,290
injection vulnerability in it I really

557
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being careless because this</font>

558
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is giving you really good</font>

559
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:26,939
information about whether it's there on

560
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:29,879
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's look</font>

561
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,450
at what this means for an application

562
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,370
security program so you've all heard a

563
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:38,700
continuous integration continuous

564
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,560
delivery I think of continuous

565
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,540
application security as being the way

566
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,280
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice application</font>

567
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,300
security I want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> always be</font>

568
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">up-to-date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to have this</font>

569
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing where we periodically run a scan</font>

570
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,170
and you know make them make a big shift

571
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,170
and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about you know</font>

572
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,940
waterfall methodology is really an

573
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,740
exercise in in doing a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

574
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,110
development and then checking like hey

575
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,000
where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we against that model that we</font>

576
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,699
may or may not have specified very well

577
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a massive correction and then</font>

578
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,640
continuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and doing that again</font>

579
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,790
continuous is really much smoother you

580
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,900
make almost constant adjustments against

581
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,940
the model and someone described it is

582
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,380
when you're riding a bike when you first

583
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">start riding a bike and make these big</font>

584
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">over Corrections all the time continuous</font>

585
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,660
is more like when you're an expert bike

586
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,370
rider and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make little</font>

587
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:30,810
corrections to stay against your model

588
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:34,939
much much smoother and better so

589
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:37,950
continuous is I think a really important

590
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,260
aspect of application security

591
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:43,049
and I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work in this over the</font>

592
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,639
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year or so basically what I tried</font>

593
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:46,559
to do was look at all the different

594
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:50,639
application security practices that are

595
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,649
out there maturity models and going back

596
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:55,799
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange book and common criteria</font>

597
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:58,830
and so on is sec mmm all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

598
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I throw away everything that doesn't</font>

599
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,158
contribute to assurance because there's

600
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,080
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff we do that there's no</font>

601
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,760
real direct line to anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

602
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,699
matters anything that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale</font>

603
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,649
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not real time anything</font>

604
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,299
that's irritating frankly because I

605
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:16,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">think those destroy application security</font>

606
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">pros or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that's tied to a</font>

607
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:20,340
particular phase of the software

608
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,309
development lifecycle throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I</font>

609
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,649
said what's left over and I tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix</font>

610
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:28,080
in principles of agile and DevOps and

611
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:29,580
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something different so I</font>

612
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,408
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together this thing called a</font>

613
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,809
continuous application security handbook

614
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:36,269
and it breaks down this idea of doing

615
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:40,230
continuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> application security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 28</font>

616
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:42,899
practices and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea really is tied to</font>

617
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:47,789
the idea of using sensors like you know

618
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">mr. 9450 here mr. Wilson and using</font>

619
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,929
sensors to gather the data comparing

620
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,408
against a model throughout application

621
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:57,720
development and really focusing on

622
00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,750
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal has been achieved like</font>

623
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,639
did you actually produce something that

624
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,880
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your application is is secure</font>

625
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:08,039
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into production and in</font>

626
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,100
particular I wanted to avoid the

627
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,600
involvement of experts or gates in the

628
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">software development process for</font>

629
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,889
security anywhere I think if we can

630
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,570
eliminate those than with we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font>

631
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:22,439
massive improvement towards towards

632
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,658
continuous so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to go</font>

633
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">through all the practices here but I</font>

634
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:31,080
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the core three this</font>

635
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,600
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three practices I think create the</font>

636
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,610
feedback loop that we really want so the

637
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,769
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is instrument everything</font>

638
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,510
second we'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making security</font>

639
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:42,779
visible and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third thing is</font>

640
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,669
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> control of security and I sort of</font>

641
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,590
see them evolving that way so the first

642
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:48,799
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want</font>

643
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:51,408
is instrument everything this is not

644
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,570
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know instrumenting with a tool</font>

645
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:55,070
like contracts for eclipse that's you

646
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,559
know that instruments one little piece

647
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,629
of this process during development but

648
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,059
you can instrument lots of parts of your

649
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,350
process to gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you need to</font>

650
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,110
figure out whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> securities going</font>

651
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,600
right so the first thing is put those

652
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,010
those instrumentations out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

653
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,799
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting you know Alex</font>

654
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,629
stainless / yahoo he's asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

655
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,700
he says vendors trying to sell us pizza

656
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,850
boxes that's not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking for</font>

657
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're looking for software sensors with</font>

658
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,020
centralized intelligence they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

659
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,929
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the direction that I think</font>

660
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,179
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually moving I like what</font>

661
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,010
Jean Kim said about this he said if you

662
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:33,049
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> code that's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to</font>

663
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,750
deploy you have code that's important

664
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to instrument and I truly believe</font>

665
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,419
that instrumentation is the future of

666
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,070
software i think in five<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ten years</font>

667
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of our software's going to be</font>

668
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,090
instrumented all the time to gather the

669
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,350
data that people need in order to see

670
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,059
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working correctly so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

671
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,740
you've got these sensors out there maybe

672
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:56,600
you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries for eclipse</font>

673
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,580
you've wrapped some other tools like zap

674
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,770
is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great tool to put out there</font>

675
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,110
as a sensor you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> run zap in a passive</font>

676
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,879
mode in your test environment just let

677
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,918
your testers test through zap and it

678
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,340
will gather a ton of data you can pull

679
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,200
the data out with a REST API and make

680
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,480
security visible so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

681
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,630
important thing culturally this is where

682
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,360
you compare that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data against the model</font>

683
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,399
and produce great dashboards that show

684
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,590
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> how on track they are or where</font>

685
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,330
you're veering off from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> model this</font>

686
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,059
allows people to correct very quickly

687
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:31,360
and it can't just be for the security

688
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">team this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be exposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

689
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,889
development has to be exposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to audit</font>

690
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,559
there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea level folks that</font>

691
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,299
need insight into this so that they can

692
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:45,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">be sure that that application security</font>

693
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:47,750
is on track look for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple dashboards</font>

694
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,080
out there yelp has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool one</font>

695
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,750
this is their CSP dashboard so you're

696
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with content security policy</font>

697
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,480
it's a interesting way of stopping XSS

698
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:59,239
in the browser and one of the

699
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">features of CSP is that it reports back</font>

700
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a central server if there's problems</font>

701
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,840
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yelp is getting thousands of</font>

702
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,040
reports a minute back now they can't

703
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,379
deal with each of those things

704
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,330
individually because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

705
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,040
but they can gather it together and

706
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,780
create great dashboards that show them

707
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,250
look here's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on with CSP</font>

708
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,510
across all the different environments

709
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:23,130
that are using using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yelp so I think</font>

710
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful way to let</font>

711
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:31,559
development know that security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

712
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:33,480
track here's a dashboard from<font color="#E5E5E5"> etsy Zane</font>

713
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,399
Lackey posts that is he said you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

714
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,470
surface security information for

715

everyone not just the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team and</font>

716
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see I don't know the details of</font>

717
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these different dashboards but you</font>

718
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,590
can see they're monitoring a whole bunch

719
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,169
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things within the</font>

720
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:50,010
organization and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

721
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:52,950
stays on track this is the one that I

722
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,379
threw together for my talk we monitor we

723
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,390
use this internally at aspect to monitor

724
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,929
a number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications that</font>

725
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,370
we run and it's powerful to it allows

726
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,520
you to slice and dice the data in a

727
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:08,489
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways so i encourage</font>

728
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,168
you to just start it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not very</font>

729
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to deploy some of these</font>

730
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:15,690
sensors pull the data together and get

731
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,520
it going in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time dashboard you</font>

732
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,080
don't have to invest hundreds of

733
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,970
thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars in order to get</font>

734
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,168
these things started you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

735
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:28,590
today in the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first talk i talked</font>

736
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:30,750
about application security<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DevOps</font>

737
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:32,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeding portfolio scale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

738
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,740
building some very simple sensors things

739
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,600
that monitor security headers and things

740
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,000
that do other simple security<font color="#E5E5E5"> checks</font>

741
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:41,250
gather the day together create a

742
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,480
dashboard and what's really cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I've</font>

743
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,270
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of organizations</font>

744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,790
now and you don't have to start with a

745
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,940
deluxe dashboard throw something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

746
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:52,830
simple but it catches on like wildfire

747
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,299
you'll change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> culture by just</font>

748
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,100
deploying some sensors getting a

749
00:29:54,299 --> 00:30:00,889
dashboard and starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feedback</font>

750
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:04,290
loop now this raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question of</font>

751
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:06,360
what do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather what sense or</font>

752
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:09,520
should we have out there that's actually

753
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the million-dollar question for this is</font>

754
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,120
how do you can't monitor everything so

755
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,270
what should<font color="#CCCCCC"> you be monitoring and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

756
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,760
encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take control of</font>

757
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:22,060
security what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is many</font>

758
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,520
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their security</font>

759
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,260
requirements all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the place so</font>

760
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,840
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some security policies that</font>

761
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:32,170
are really vague that's part of this

762
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,970
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some security guidance and</font>

763
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,170
security requirement documents maybe

764
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they got some security test cases</font>

765
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:42,600
they're not connected together they're

766
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,250
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

767
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,949
nobody ever has a sense of what is

768
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,720
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

769
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,700
organization in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> some organizations</font>

770
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any of that stuff they just</font>

771
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,780
rely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool that they're right they</font>

772
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,760
say well for security what are we doing

773
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,020
well we're running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some scanner</font>

774
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,590
tool who's got control of security let's

775
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:08,740
whoever wrote that tool right and just

776
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know tools report the things that</font>

777
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,460
are easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to find they don't</font>

778
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,300
report the things that are important to

779
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,440
you so it's prioritized all wrong so

780
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,149
what I want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is think about</font>

781
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,710
what do you currently care about and you

782
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,570
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what security controls you</font>

783
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,220
got out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look at what tools</font>

784
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,919
you're using and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse</font>

785
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,050
engineer the security policy that you're

786
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,270
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enforce it doesn't</font>

787
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,830
say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's a few hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exercise</font>

788
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,240
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting this together and</font>

789
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,669
building up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font>

790
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,980
care about then that's your model right

791
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:43,120
that's your 9450 model that's what

792
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,030
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be measuring against</font>

793
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,379
from then<font color="#CCCCCC"> on once you have that then you</font>

794
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,820
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sensors in place to measure</font>

795
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,620
against the model and now you've started

796
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this feedback loop right you've got</font>

797
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,750
sensors you've got the analytics that

798
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're measuring against the model and</font>

799
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process is you know new threat comes</font>

800
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,899
out you improve the model roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a</font>

801
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,060
sensor and now it's part of your

802
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,820
dashboard that's the feedback loop that

803
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,610
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start going once you do that</font>

804
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,980
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get secure you iterate</font>

805
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,979
that model faster and faster until you

806
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,010
are really improved and it's a lot

807
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,450
simpler<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

808
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,010
you know these big<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy weights</font>

809
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:24,230
maturity models that are out now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

810
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:26,000
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about how this these</font>

811
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,160
models and sensors work most

812
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,170
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks a little bit like</font>

813
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,520
this you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a model but it's not</font>

814
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:35,750
well defined it's really spotty and a

815
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,580
bunch of it of the stuff that you really

816
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,410
care about is not being tested so I see

817
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,409
tons of different organizations where

818
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,880
you know they're testing I mean they're

819
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:46,730
they care about things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

820
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,020
control and encryption algorithm

821
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,510
strength and so on but they're not

822
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,250
testing it at all because it's not what

823
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,580
their tool can do it's not what their

824
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:59,180
pen testers can do Allah and then on the

825
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:00,470
other side you deploy tools and sensors

826
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,650
to measure things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't care</font>

827
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,900
about that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure waste right so</font>

828
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,460
I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that have deployed</font>

829
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:10,270
tools to test for sequel injection on

830
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:13,700
applications that don't have a database

831
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:15,590
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably not going to work ok so</font>

832
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,880
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get these things in alignment</font>

833
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,379
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have your model and then</font>

834
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">your measure against the model with</font>

835
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,440
sensors in real time otherwise you'll

836
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:28,130
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just this and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

837
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,250
mean secure right so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the three</font>

838
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,540
core practices in continuous and you can

839
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,670
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> by our booth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

840
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,560
copies of this if you want to dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

841
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,480
this and understand you know how you can

842
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">really start a continuous practice I'll</font>

843
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,760
run through the other five quickly

844
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,120
there's an important activity about

845
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,670
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your enemy this is monitoring</font>

846
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,129
sources like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aspen first and other</font>

847
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,450
organizations that look at threats to

848
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,520
make sure that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> defending against</font>

849
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right stuff because you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

850
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,520
to be you know two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> three years</font>

851
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,320
after something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF is discovered</font>

852
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,330
you don't want to finally discover it

853
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,980
and then try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in protections too</font>

854
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,929
late I see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organizations today</font>

855
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,330
so who here would say that their

856
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:16,668
enterprises is fully defended against

857
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:18,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML external entity injection not a lot</font>

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:24,349
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 33</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

860
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,299
something at least

861
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,619
why organizations not taking you

862
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,788
seriously well it just hasn't become

863
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:31,399
part of their model and they haven't

864
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:33,049
ruled out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors yet because not</font>

865
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,399
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pen test firms aren't</font>

866
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:38,589
testing for that yet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

867
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">hasn't achieved you know significant</font>

868
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:43,969
visibility yet so you got to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

869
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,109
enemy implementing strong defenses is

870
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:47,029
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm really passionate</font>

871
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:49,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know I spent some time writing</font>

872
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:52,190
the enterprise security API here as a

873
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:54,049
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of standardizing security</font>

874
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,460
defenses for things like validation and

875
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:58,249
output escaping and logging an

876
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,979
encryption and so on and when you

877
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:03,709
centralize and standardize on strong

878
00:35:00,979 --> 00:35:07,098
defenses it makes your model so much

879
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:09,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">simpler because now instead of asking 50</font>

880
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:11,119
questions about is your authentication

881
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,700
implemented correctly for all these

882
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,869
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you can just say did you</font>

883
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,419
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard authentication</font>

884
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:19,700
mechanism it's one question one sensor

885
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,890
that you need to deploy so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

886
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,759
things massively simpler if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

887
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:27,379
standard strong defenses you should hack

888
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:28,849
yourself and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of that</font>

889
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,329
feedback loop is this is where you

890
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:33,950
improve you should have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity that</font>

891
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:36,799
you're continuously practicing that

892
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:38,899
looks at both your implementation and

893
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:40,819
your model and tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find loopholes</font>

894
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,499
and there are people out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

895
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:44,269
really good at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should spend</font>

896
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">some time poking holes in your model and</font>

897
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:48,288
strengthening it then once you do roll

898
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:53,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense and roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the sensor</font>

899
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:55,759
to verify that defense you should expect

900
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,130
failure this means that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font>

901
00:35:55,759 --> 00:36:00,229
get breached eventually and you should

902
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">be ready and there's some practices that</font>

903
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:04,729
I described in the handbook about being

904
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,140
ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle a a breach and respond</font>

905
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,868
quickly so that it does it's not

906
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,519
terrible and then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is I</font>

907
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:12,799
also think it's important to promote

908
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,930
security culture now frankly if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

909
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:17,630
the first three things you'll be well on

910
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:20,629
your way to generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

911
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:23,239
culture that is compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with software</font>

912
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,009
development you'll be giving developers

913
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:27,170
feedback in real time useful feedback

914
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:29,829
you won't be slowing them down we<font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

915
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,749
an amount and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is about</font>

916
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:34,519
broader themes you know doing some

917
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">training doing some awareness raising</font>

918
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,020
visibility

919
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:41,840
the whole organization about security

920
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,280
and that's it 8 simple activities to get

921
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,600
a continuous application security

922
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,460
program going so I encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

923
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,160
think about the model here says right on

924
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,570
here it says the ball don't lie which i

925
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">think is important to think about you</font>

926
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,860
know the sensors don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie they are</font>

927
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:00,520
ground truth and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

928
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:03,290
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that in application security</font>

929
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,690
so thanks a lot I'm here I'm here to

930
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,220
meet you please seek me out you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

931
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,960
by if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a demo</font>

932
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,009
of contrast for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eclipse please stop by</font>

933
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,920
the contrast booth and you can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

934
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:25,690
free hand book and that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love to</font>

935
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:33,890
take some questions come on am I crazy

936
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the loss top 10 I don't know</font>

937
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,190
there might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some printed out</font>

938
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,259
somewhere somebody gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a shirt in</font>

939
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:46,550
Boston with the top 10 printed on it

940
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:48,800
that count who thinks I asked is a good

941
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:52,540
idea here I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

942
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,540
who's going to give this thing a try

943
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,000
great if you if you've used sastre

944
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,300
dashed in the past then I absolutely

945
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,340
that's like dr. Seuss I think you

946
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,200
absolutely should give I asked a try

947
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,580
because it's it is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

948
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sasson deaths have been around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

949
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:11,150
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

950
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:14,090
evolved there's not a lot to open source

951
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,860
there but you can't add<font color="#CCCCCC"> rule I mean it's</font>

952
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,240
open to the sense you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can add rules and</font>

953
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:23,230
you know deploy new sensors on top of

954
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,229
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ask platform</font>

955
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:32,329
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know it's significantly</font>

956
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,339
less false positives than a traditional

957
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:36,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">sasser desk tool and the reason is we</font>

958
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:39,380
only report things that actually occur

959
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:42,109
within the application so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

960
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't lose the thread like static tools</font>

961
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:46,160
do so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no none of this law sinks</font>

962
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:50,180
and lost sources and all that sort of

963
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,609
stuff the only kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of false positives</font>

964
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,740
that we do have or if we don't know

965
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,450
about a validation method that you're

966
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,970
using like if you're using you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not</font>

967
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,379
something from apache commons or isapi

968
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,230
or whatever if you're using your own

969
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,450
validator then you'll see a

970
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,770
vulnerability there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you should say</font>

971
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:08,419
oh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that's validated add</font>

972
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:11,150
the validator and then it goes away

973
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,329
right so you have to train it to your

974
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:19,130
validators and encoders a little bit

975
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:21,710
yeah it does really well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

976
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:25,070
major advantage because we're inside the

977
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:27,800
running application we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know we</font>

978
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:30,290
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to teach our tool everything</font>

979
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,940
about the framework static tools you

980
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,130
know they don't analyze the whole app

981
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,980
they only analyze the custom code so

982
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,359
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your your code calls the</font>

983
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,450
framework or the framework calls your

984
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,670
code the static tool has to have some

985
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,680
knowledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is supposed to</font>

986
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">work you know what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen</font>

987
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,000
ours doesn't because you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> traced</font>

988
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:53,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data wherever it goes through all of</font>

989
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,630
that code so it's much easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

990
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,490
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> new frameworks and we handle all</font>

991
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:04,040
the major Java frameworks and web

992
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:06,078
service frameworks that are out there so

993
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,109
for the most part the the contracts for

994
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,150
Eclipse tool focuses on just the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

995
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:12,560
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems we don't do we have</font>

996
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,020
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every area but we don't do</font>

997
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,880
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you know access control or</font>

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,109
custom kinds of implementations but you

1000
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:27,130
know sir the other eight allows top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:29,960
items<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really well you can train</font>

1002
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:33,890
contrast to find custom things for your

1003
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,380
code so you know underneath the is agent

1004
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,490
is just a pattern matcher it says if we

1005
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a certain pattern in the co</font>

1006
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:44,459
we either you know we report<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a</font>

1007
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:46,980
vulnerability you can model positive

1008
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,900
rules as well in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1009
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,600
contrast looks to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pattern is</font>

1010
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,430
there to verify that it's been followed

1011
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,890
properly I'm a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan of positive</font>

1012
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,540
security rules meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool</font>

1013
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,250
should model what the application is

1014
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,680
supposed to do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's not</font>

1015
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,840
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do right it's much more</font>

1016
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,759
accurate to model positive rules but

1017
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,410
that positive rules you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1018
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,150
teach it a little bit right you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1019
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,819
tell the toll here's how we're doing

1020
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:14,700
access control and then contrast can

1021
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:19,100
verify it so it's possible but you know

1022
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,100
some custom rules for positive stuff yet

1023
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,670
well the contrast for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eclipse is just</font>

1024
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,440
for development if you want to talk to

1025
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,060
playing in in test environments or

1026
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,100
staging environments or<font color="#E5E5E5"> production</font>

1027
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,410
there's come by the booth and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

1028
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about that but yeah its production</font>

1029
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,080
ready we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on this for a</font>

1030
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,618
long time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it we actually want a</font>

1031
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">navy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contract to to focus on performance</font>

1032
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:50,369
of the agent so we're really good at

1033
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,750
real time instrumentation very much like

1034
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:53,010
the way New Relic works I don't have a

1035
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,440
familiar with it told New Relic but it's

1036
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,750
a application performance monitoring

1037
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,970
tool you just drop in the agent just

1038
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you drop in this asian and it does</font>

1039
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,459
the same thing just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for performance this</font>

1040
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,990
is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same thing for security</font>

1041
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:10,830
yeah so everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens within</font>

1042
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:13,069
the JVM this tracks we do have the

1043
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:16,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to track some things off JVM</font>

1044
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,000
into the database and<font color="#E5E5E5"> back if you're</font>

1045
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,810
using standard database api's like

1046
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,350
hibernate and and so on we can do that

1047
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:26,288
but what we haven't done is linked up

1048
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,650
applications that are composed

1049
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:32,109
to multiple different pieces like if

1050
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,900
you've got a web service or multiple web

1051
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:37,558
services that there's a central you know

1052
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">front-end controller we don't we'll</font>

1053
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:47,589
connect the trace between all the pieces

1054
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:49,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the application yet right alright</font>

1055
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you very much I appreciate it come</font>

1056
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">on by</font>
