1
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,880
well thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for inviting me it's nice to</font>

2
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:26,480
be in austin and to be here at<font color="#CCCCCC"> westcon</font>

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,910
the goal of today's talk is to see what

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,529
we might learn from the history of

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,080
cybersecurity we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,180
cybersecurity back in the late 60s early

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,120
to mid 70s I called it information

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">security cryptography to help us better</font>

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,970
deal with potential future challenges

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,730
now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning well I obviously did a lot</font>

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,280
of work in cryptography this is not my I

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,660
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretend to be current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am I</font>

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,610
interests or more in international

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,519
security as I was explaining it so well

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,090
I keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with it I don't pretend to</font>

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:04,070
know everything that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on so fact</font>

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:07,040
one back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early 1970s when I was</font>

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,139
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work in cryptography almost</font>

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,119
all my colleagues in fact I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,600
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be an exaggeration to say all</font>

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my colleagues thought I was crazy and</font>

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,020
they had two really good reasons NSA had

23
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,208
a humongous budget now thanks to Snowden

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,850
we know how much but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days we</font>

25
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:28,190
didn't and they had let's see this was

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,550
nineteen seventy NSA had been around for

27
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,470
about 25 years almost and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,500
proceeding<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization so they had you</font>

29
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">know 25 year head start on me billions</font>

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,860
upon billions of dollars how could I

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,100
hope to discover something they didn't

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,709
already know and the second argument was

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,678
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything good it'll never see</font>

34
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:52,130
the light of day they will classify it

35
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:54,470
now both arguments had validity and the

36
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,399
first one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example came to haunt me</font>

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:02,330
much later around 1991<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ the British</font>

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,490
equivalent to NSA put out this press

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,560
release and there was a paper in crypto

40
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,030
lojja for the real story<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,650
invention of public key cryptography

42
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:16,730
read this and its people within<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ</font>

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,170
claiming to have invented what's now

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,859
often called diffie-hellman key exchange

45
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,040
although check out simon sings book the

exchange if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

49
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,190

know of course my answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was it</font>

57
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,700
doesn't matter what they know and what's

on information<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and he had to</font>

75
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,069
submit a proposal for term project and

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,750
he submitted two ideas one of which I

77
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,929
forget the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other of which was to develop</font>

78
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,430
public-key cryptography basically and he

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">still has the page on which the</font>

instructor the professor wrote the first

81
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,410
idea looks better to me but maybe that's

82
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,930
because your explanation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other so</font>

83
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,690
muddled<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph also had problems when he</font>

submitted it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ca-siem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

85
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,150
reviewers said you can't do this and the

86
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,599
editor wrote back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph again showed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not in the mainstream of cryptographic</font>

91
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,060
research consequently rouse paper was

92
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,459
delayed it took about two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,500
to get published whereas our paper New

94
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,130
Directions in cryptography by wit myself

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,849
appeared six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months after week submitted</font>

96
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,919
the final form of it and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font>

97
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:34,560
like rouse paper followed ours but if

98
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,090
you see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cm does not have submission</font>

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,940
dates but you see that Ralph actually

100
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,638
submitted his paper before us they're

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,210
slightly different but still

102
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,499
basic ideas are there well in terms of

103
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,680
if you do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> good they'll classify</font>

104
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:51,740
what happened a man named<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay a Meyer</font>

105
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,889
who lived in maryland and was an i

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:02,029
triple e member<font color="#CCCCCC"> x i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this</font>

107
00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:05,300
down i wrote a letter to the I Triple E

108
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:07,520
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> his home address in Maryland saying</font>

109
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,129
he's really concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the I Triple</font>

110
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,789
E appears to be breaking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law by</font>

111
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:15,770
publishing papers and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> never said in</font>

112
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:20,210
cryptography but he listed several

113
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,919
several journal issues and I had a paper

114
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,628
and every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them except for</font>

115
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,520
one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what that other paper</font>

116
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:27,469
was that concerned him or who is just a

117
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,229
way to disguise that what he's really

118
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:32,629
saying is hey hellmann's causing a lot

119
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,169
of trouble helmets breaking the law so

120
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:37,759
the I Triple E responded to meijer oh we

121
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:41,748
also wit was able to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

122
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,150
Meyer worked at NSA which he and so in

123
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:46,219
fact a little concerned if NSA we knew

124
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,739
NSA was very unhappy with us publishing

125
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:51,289
our papers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they won't they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

126
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:57,620
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a born classified area of</font>

127
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:59,089
research and we knew that especially in

128
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,949
those days NSA is much more open today

129
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:02,719
they would not necessarily come right

130
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,099
out and sit and accuse you they would do

131
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,330
something like have someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a</font>

132
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,729
letter from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home address at least</font>

133
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was our belief so I took the letter</font>

134
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:16,128
O so the I Triple E replied to Meyer and

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,580
sent a copy to me and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> replies said</font>

136
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,810
we're aware of this law which by the way

137
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved two years in jail for breaking</font>

138
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:26,270
it but it's never we've always been of

139
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,279
the opinion that we can't act as the

140
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,229
gatekeeper we can't control<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's up</font>

141
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,539
to the authors it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the authors</font>

142
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,909
and their institutions to make sure that

143
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,469
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not violating this law it's</font>

144
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:39,770
called the international traffic in arms

145
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:43,039
regulation or I tarp and any of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

146
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,109
had to go get export licenses know what

147
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,289
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it still it was called the same</font>

148
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,819
thing so I took it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Stanford's legal</font>

149
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,280
counsel the<font color="#CCCCCC"> general counsel man named</font>

150
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,020
John Schwarz for he

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,150
looked at it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he concluded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said</font>

152
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,659
it's my legal opinion that if the law is

153
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,429
construed to cover your work then it's

154
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,650
unconstitutional because there's freedom

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,730
of speech there's freedom of the press

156
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,669
but he said that's only my legal opinion

157
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,400
the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> real way to determine this is</font>

158
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:16,310
in a court of law and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I</font>

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,549
was prosecuted they would the university

160
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,280
would pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my legal defense and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

161
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,840
was convicted they would appeal but and

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,619
I'll never forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> these words he said</font>

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,450
but I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to warn you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if all appeals</font>

164
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:34,640
are exhausted we obviously can't go to

165
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:36,950
jail for you but with the university's

166
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,719
backing I felt comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward</font>

167
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,760
and there was some debate as to whether

168
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,440
i should give the papers or the students

169
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,599
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve polling and ralph merkle</font>

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,880
were the co-authors on these two papers

171
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,140
oh there was a conference coming up in

172
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,760
three months this was the summer of

173
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,360
nineteen seventy-seven that we get the

174
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,680
jmeyer letter and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> October 1977</font>

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,820
there's an I tripoli international

176
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,560
symposium on information theory at

177
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,360
Cornell University in Ithaca and I had

178
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,250
two papers there one with Steve<font color="#CCCCCC"> polling</font>

179
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,789
now at Lincoln labs and the other with

180
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,350
Ralph Merkle and I was going to have the

181
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,210
students give the papers but John

182
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,010
Schwarz Stanford's general counsel

183
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,440
strongly recommended that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the students</font>

184
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,560
not give the papers he pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

185
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,630
a newly minted PhD would have great

186
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,910
difficulty starting a career with a

187
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,070
multi-year legal case hanging over his

188
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,630
head potentially and there was some

189
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,338
<font color="#E5E5E5">other reasons why he recommended I give</font>

190
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,689
the papers i went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the students and</font>

191
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,280
said I'm happy either way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font>

192
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable i'm not worried about giving</font>

193
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,959
them but the students<font color="#CCCCCC"> said no they want</font>

194
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,390
to give the papers but a little bit

195
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,890
later I get a call I both of them come

196
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,980
to see me their parents have been

197
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,540
beating on them and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

198
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,089
keep our parents happy please give the

199
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,329
papers so when it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> time at the</font>

200
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:58,430
conference like just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like today when I</font>

201
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,970
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> were called up for the paper both i</font>

202
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,189
and the student went up and I then said

203
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,010
normally Steve or Ralph would be giving

204
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,310
the paper but

205
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,350
under advice of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford's Council I</font>

206
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,719
will be giving it instead but I want him

207
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get full credit so pretend that from</font>

208
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,350
every other point of view other than

209
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,930
legally as if everything I'm saying is

210
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,970
is coming from him and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

211
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,469
students got more attention and credit

212
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,570
for their work this way than the air but

213
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,970
everybody knew what was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

214
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,080
fortunately we were not arrested

215
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,960
although as some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Phil</font>

216
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,700
Zimmerman who put out PGP did have to

217
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,250
get legal representation I don't think

218
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,460
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was indicted but came very close so</font>

219
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,810
lesson number one let's see going back

220
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,390
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my colleague saying you know I'm</font>

221
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy not that being arrested potential</font>

222
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,449
because that's something to be worried

223
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,890
about don't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> afraid to undertake</font>

224
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,860
something just because everyone thinks

225
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:52,710
you're crazy and if you want to see a

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,110
whole hour on this I have a talk I gave

227
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,390
it Stanford they have a program called

228
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,510
Stanford engineering heroes into<font color="#CCCCCC"> which I</font>

229
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,370
was inducted a year ago january and i

230
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,439
gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk which is online if you</font>

231
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,510
google Stanford engineering heroes and

232
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,920
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> will my talk they'll have a link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,660
a YouTube presentation many other

234
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">technically which is all on the wisdom</font>

235
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,170
of foolishness and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you just a</font>

236
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,790
brief outline of some of the other

237
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,800
technological breakthroughs which

238
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,969
appeared foolish at first anyone ever

239
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,520
hear of Vint Cerf yes one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

240
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,470
pioneers of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Google's</font>

241
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,530
chief internet evangelist I think he's

242
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the coolest title of anybody in</font>

243
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,579
technology and so I carried on an email

244
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,800
correspondence with about four people

245
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">who I knew next I could have done with a</font>

247
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,110
recognized for their work and all of

248
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,270
whom were told they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy at first</font>

another example is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of</font>

of the conventional wisdom of<font color="#CCCCCC"> not let's</font>

you've heard those cookie of course

even if you're in the military<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

the other side and so august tyr cops

who many you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of</font>

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,139
enunciated some principles of

cryptography in the late 19th century

362

one of which is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security of a</font>

363
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,399
cryptographic systems should reside in

00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:35,050
the secrecy of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key even if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is known about the general</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">system that should not reduce the</font>

367
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,819
security and so when we propose public

00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,150
key cryptography it<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost sounded like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">an oxymoron how</font>

370
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,750
you have secure cryptography if the key

371
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,579
is public well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course where people</font>

372
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,620
were missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that there was only part</font>

373
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,640
of the key was public the other part of

374
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:00,350
the key was secret and this is very

375
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:04,550
similar to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened with white back</font>

376
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:06,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 400</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago roughly there is</font>

377
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,510
this big debate as to whether white was

378
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,010
a particle or a wave does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

379
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:15,080
remember who<font color="#CCCCCC"> was one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the prominent</font>

380
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:17,420
particle camp supporters Newton's or

381
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,010
Isaac Newton right and you could forgive

382
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,420
him for it in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than forgiving</font>

383
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,090
you can credit to them today<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we</font>

384
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,579
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that quantum mechanics</font>

385
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,520
works in light and there are these

386
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,970
quanta involved allows things like these

387
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,400
GPS and this phone that I have here but

388
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,050
in the late 19th century about the same

389
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:43,760
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care cops enunciated his</font>

390
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:46,189
principles Maxwell developed his four

391
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,260
famous equations that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that light</font>

392
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:53,690
was clearly governed as a wave and so at

393
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,000
1900 saying that white might have

394
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">particle like characteristics was viewed</font>

395
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
as going back to the dark ages so when

396
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,380
punk the very famous physicist they

397
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,359
finally explained blackbody radiation

398
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,000
this is when you heat up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like a metal</font>

399
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,229
rod in a fire and starts to glow red and

400
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,790
then if you get it really hot like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

401
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,300
tungsten filament it glows white hot

402
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:17,349
there's a spectrum that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes with that</font>

403
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,700
black body radiation and classical

404
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,560
electromagnetic theory basically using

405
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,089
Maxwell's equations and things related

406
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,300
to it predicted what's called the

407
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:29,510
ultraviolet catastrophe it didn't fit

408
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,720
the curve and plunk eventually figured

409
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,280
out how to make it work one of the

410
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,130
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did was he said let's pretend</font>

411
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,720
light is emitted in quanta and then he

412
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,090
thought as he took<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limit as the</font>

413
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,650
particle<font color="#E5E5E5"> size went 2-0 he might get the</font>

414
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,179
right result well he got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

415
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,820
result but when the particle size

416
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,760
stopped just short of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and so in</font>

417
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:53,720
fact that equation<font color="#CCCCCC"> e equals H nu where h</font>

418
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,780
is planck's constant is what was later

419
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,500
discovered by Einstein but Punk was so

420
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,480
an

having moved out of the dark ages that

423
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,300
when he wrote up his explanation for

almost as if it was emitted in quanto

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,000
wait until you need to know everything

435
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,520
lesson number three from history is to

436
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,830
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to colleagues from disparate but</font>

437
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,370
related areas especially those not

438
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:46,010
already working in your area a good

439
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,629
example there is as I was working in

440
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:52,070
cryptography and I think what had showed

441
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:54,800
up at my doorstep by this time I went to

442
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">a new assistant professor at Stanford</font>

443
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,070
John Gill who has had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PhD in</font>

444
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,560
mathematics from Berkeley<font color="#CCCCCC"> he worked with</font>

445
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:07,550
Manuel<font color="#CCCCCC"> blom who some of you may know so</font>

446
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:11,480
he is he worked on probabilistic

447
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:13,310
computation and some very esoteric

448
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,940
things I went to John because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he knew</font>

449
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,620
more math than I did and I said John do

450
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know any functions that are easy to</font>

451
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,419
compute but hard to invert one-way

452
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,010
function which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

453
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,290
develop with wit a cryptographic

454
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,330
taxonomy and the simplest cryptographic

455
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,440
function we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of was a one-way</font>

456
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:35,840
function and letter John is one of the

457
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,300
first african-american graduates of

458
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,560
Georgia Tech and he said oh how about

459
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,690
factoring I said well we'd already

460
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,919
thought of that one unfortunately we

461
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,320
haven't taken it far enough and

462
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,050
developed RSA in fact we walked all

463
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,840
around RS<font color="#CCCCCC"> a that's a whole nother story</font>

464
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:56,480
but Johnson well then how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about indices</font>

465
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,110
I said what's an index it's what we call

466
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,390
a discrete logarithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and so the</font>

467
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,760
basis for diffie-hellman merkel key

468
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,860
exchange and really to some extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

469
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,379
basis for RSA because while it involves

470
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,758
exponentiation and mod arithmetic and so

471
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,029
while factoring is part of

472
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:16,279
the potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> weakness or one way of</font>

473
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:18,859
attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSA another way is as a</font>

474
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,509
discrete logarithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> or an index and so</font>

475
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:23,079
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that conversation with John Gill</font>

476
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:29,329
who came from a totally different area

477
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:31,969
hold on a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cain really two of the</font>

478
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:34,279
most important advances in public key

479
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:35,570
cryptography so talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people from</font>

480
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:40,249
different areas the same thing happened

481
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">with elliptic curves by the way so for a</font>

482
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:43,669
long time there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that we</font>

483
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,408
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have in RSA we needed to have</font>

484
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,749
P and Q the two prime numbers have

485
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:52,099
certain characteristics like P minus 1

486
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:54,289
should have at least one large factor

487
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:58,698
well then when someone who knew a looked

488
00:20:54,289 --> 00:21:00,408
at curves apply that to factoring we it

489
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:02,329
turned out that wasn't the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

490
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:08,019
all and then we developed a lip to curve

491
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:12,969
cryptography so really go far afield one

492
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:16,609
last lesson that I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

493
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:18,289
has to do with my current<font color="#E5E5E5"> work part of</font>

494
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,958
<font color="#E5E5E5">my current work is applying risk</font>

496
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:25,369
nuclear deterrence clearly a problem of

497
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,489
significant importance even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's</font>

498
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:29,869
being overlooked by society and I won't

499
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,429
go into detail there but i'll just give

500
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:33,079
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> background and then show</font>

507
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:47,539
about nuclear deterrence a hey if it

508
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,989
ain't broke don't fix it it's been 69

509
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:53,569
years since world war<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and we haven't</font>

510
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:55,849
had a nuclear war what are you worried

about it ain't<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke don't fix it well</font>

512
00:21:55,849 --> 00:22:00,619
you have to break<font color="#CCCCCC"> that down what's the</font>

513
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,579
expected lifetime of a child born today

514
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:07,369
roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 years yeah a little more than</font>

515
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:10,339
80 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if something hasn't happened</font>

516
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,899
in 69 years is that give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

517
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:14,359
confidence that it won't happen over the

518
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:16,728
next 80 clearly not especially as you

519
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:21,199
start to look at the near misses well in

520
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:23,989
the same way people look at advances in

521
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,519
factoring which which also have carried

522
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:27,249
over to

523
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:30,339
greet logs and so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we first came up</font>

524
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:33,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">with alpha to the x1 x2 which</font>

525
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:36,070
diffie-hellman<font color="#CCCCCC"> merkel key exchange at</font>

526
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:39,459
that point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best algorithms that I</font>

527
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:41,950
knew of were exponential time to break

528
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:44,019
it well soon afterward we saw that there

529
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,109
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same factoring algorithms</font>

530
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:48,879
that Richards<font color="#CCCCCC"> repeal had developed which</font>

531
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,009
gave rise the quadratic sieve of

532
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:53,289
Pomerance is actually based in Pomerance

533
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:55,659
credits trope al he's another unsung

534
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,789
hero of cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> trope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l didn't like</font>

535
00:22:55,659 --> 00:23:00,339
to publish and so he circulated his

536
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:02,259
papers privately and I had seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I</font>

537
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:04,029
sent them to Rivest Shamir an Adelman

538
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:07,029
actually just<font color="#CCCCCC"> ron rivest who shared them</font>

539
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:09,129
with his colleagues and Pomerance also

540
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:11,679
had a copy and in his paper on quadratic

541
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:16,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">sieve Pomerance credits to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> repel with</font>

542
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:20,019
having the basic idea anyway as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

543
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:21,129
at the history of fact let's just talk

544
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:23,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">about factoring although it applies to</font>

545
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:25,689
discrete logs to around nineteen seventy

546
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,669
Morrison and brillhart developed the

547
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,429
continued fraction algorithm for

548
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:33,639
factoring which roughly doubled the size

549
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:36,329
of numbers we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could factor and around</font>

550
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:39,488
nineteen eighty the quadratic sieve or

551
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,829
repulsive doubled the key size again and

552
00:23:39,489 --> 00:23:43,659
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> around nineteen ninety the number</font>

553
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:46,149
field sieve roughly doubled the key size

554
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:47,649
we needed again so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> in at</font>

555
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,928
nineteen seventy nineteen eighty

556
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:52,599
nineteen ninety ten years apart roughly

557
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:56,499
we have advances that roughly doubled

558
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:59,499
the key size but in two thousand was

559
00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:01,659
there another a major advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> no in</font>

560
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:04,929
those ten years nineteen ninety one to

561
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:08,169
two thousand no major events 2001 to

562
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:10,749
2010 no major advance so some people

563
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:13,239
have said many people have said it looks

564
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:15,279
like the advances in factoring have

565
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:18,159
petered out you can see where they would

566
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,469
say that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apply the same kind of</font>

567
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,479
analysis I did to hey nuclear deterrence

568
00:24:20,469 --> 00:24:25,719
his work for 69 years there's nothing to

569
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:29,440
worry about well a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to think of</font>

570
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:32,379
it is in terms of every decade being a

571
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,059
coin toss if the coin shows heads for

572
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:36,218
that decade then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to double the</font>

573
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:36,990
key size if the coin shows tails we

574
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:39,270
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

575
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,780
so the 50 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experience we have</font>

576
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,910
goes heads heads heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> three advances in</font>

577
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,050
a row decade after<font color="#E5E5E5"> decade doubling key</font>

578
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,580
size followed by how many tails<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 tails</font>

579
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:53,490
so if you wanna call it toss a coin of

580
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,919
unknown bias and got heads heads heads

581
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,660

much money that is not going to show a

00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,179

584
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,419
why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we assuming that there won't be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">way let's say I'm doing well now I first</font>

587
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:17,010
art made this argument for a small

588

private conference in january 2013 so

600
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,920
and then shrope<font color="#CCCCCC"> l took it to e to the</font>

603

604

605
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,870
getting smaller and smaller and the

606
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:17,550
first advance by this group went to e to

607
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:18,840
the fourth root<font color="#E5E5E5"> of log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n and then but</font>

608
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,659
it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fields of small</font>

609
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,909

610
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,700
RSA cannot be applied to our essay for

611
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:29,429
example and it can't be applied to most

612
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,250
difficult key exchanges well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

613
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,590
have to worry before we've seen it

614
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,490
advances that sometimes worked on fields

615
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:41,610
of small characteristic like coppersmith

616
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,890
yeah coppersynth came up with a an e to

617
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,260
the cube root of log n algorithm four

fields of characteristic to in 1984

619
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,960
which was

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,760
ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arbitrary fields six years</font>

622
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,379
field sieve so you have to worry about

623
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,690
this and while no one has<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet extended</font>

00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:20,799
some warning shots there and maybe they

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be extended but prudence would</font>

dictate being concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

633
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:32,740
especially when you think of all that's

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:34,719
at stake now for decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worried</font>

635
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:38,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the look like all the limited gene</font>

pool of public key cryptography when

637
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,389
Whitney and then later Ralph I mean

638
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,649
Ralph actually independently even are a

639
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,090
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier than us but then the</font>

640
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:48,518
three of us together we're talking about

641
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,918
public key cryptography we thought that

642
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:54,039
within ten years there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a</font>

643
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,649
plethora of public-key algorithms to

644
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,019
consider whereas in reality today we but

645
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:01,418
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically diffie-hellman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merkel</font>

646
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we've got digital signature</font>

647
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:06,730
algorithm which is closely related and

648
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:10,779
we have our essay all of which depend on

649
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,179
either on factoring or discrete

650
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:15,669
logarithms for their security it's a

651
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:17,320
very limited gene pool and now there's a

652
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">look to curve cryptography which looks</font>

653
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's somewhat different even though</font>

654
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:24,189
it's a form of discrete logarithm but in

655
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,990
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of group but that</font>

656
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,669
limited gene pool worries me and I've

657
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:30,340
argued for decades that we ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

658
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:32,919
think about backup plans just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in case</font>

659
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,470
because let's say that someone took that

660
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,169
current paper and extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

661
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:41,740
arbitrary fields and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> factoring we'd</font>

662
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:43,059
be dead I mean electronic banking or all

663
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,760
the stuff that depends on public key

664
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:47,850
cryptography and so how long would it

665
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,960
take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put new algorithms in place</font>

666
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:55,178
years and so what I've argued we ought

667
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to consider doing and I don't pretend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

668
00:28:55,179 --> 00:29:00,050
be current I don't pretend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

669
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,629
an operational person I'm a theoretician

670
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,250
and I may see things as easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

671
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,680
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very expensive but how</font>

672
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:09,440
expensive would it be to put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place a</font>

673
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,660
key distribution center or multiple key

674
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,890
distribution centers though this was the

675
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,630
concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we were going to</font>

676
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:18,140
distribute keys before public key

677
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,960
cryptography was invented we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

678
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,550
one or more k<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC's key distribution</font>

679
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,370
center so let's say we just keep it with

680
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:28,070
one everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single secret key</font>

681
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,800
that they share with you the KDC when

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:34,129
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk we start the</font>

683
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,930
protocol by talking to the KDC and using

684
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,460
our private keys that need I don't know

that we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> use as the key for our</font>

694
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,639
dcs we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk with both of you you</font>

695
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,730
generate independent random numbers we

696
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,310
XOR them together and then as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

697
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,710
either KDC is secure our<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversations</font>

698
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:09,350
secure well then what you do is you XOR

699
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:12,200
that with a dippy Hellman<font color="#E5E5E5"> merkel key</font>

701
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,300
if public key cryptography stays secure

702
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,120
you guys were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just added benefit</font>

703
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,159
but if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever breaks the current</font>

704
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,919
public key systems and we suddenly need

705
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,080
security we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have security because we</font>

706

have the the system has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been running all</font>

707
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,980
along in in parallel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if that's</font>

708
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,390
not too expensive to do and you have to

709
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about what the cost would be if</font>

710
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's one of these breaks and what the</font>

711
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:41,480
probability of such a break is I mean

712
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,510
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one-percent chance of public key</font>

00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,360
cryptography being broken massively over

714
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,910
the next decade would cause billions of

715
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,290
dollars maybe trillion maybe even

716
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:57,590
hundreds of billions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

717
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:58,879
damage over and for signatures you might

718
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,790
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well can you do for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signatures</font>

719
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,770
merkel ralph merkle came up with a tree

720
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,540
signature scheme that depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on</font>

721
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:09,590
one-way function it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

722
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,310
problems whether it generates only a

limited number

724
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,450

725
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,790

750
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:32,070
elliptic curves were really going to be

751
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,260
an important technology because of these

761
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,929
looked really tainted was the elliptic

763
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:06,780
that is that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I think that's</font>

764
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:08,340
something different actually locate it

765
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:12,330
like some articles where people were

766
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:15,270
saying that the way how at least not

00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,080
pseudo-random number generator there I

772
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,870
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> three pseudo-random number</font>

and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them uses elliptic curves and</font>

775
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:36,660
what this what came out of the Snowden

776
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,580
revelations that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone wanted to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bill and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some correct me if they know</font>

778
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,899
better if someone wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a trap</font>

779
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,540
door so a trap door is secret

780
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,430
information that the designer used to

781
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,139
build in a weakness that if you know the

782
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,460
trapdoor information you can then break

783
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,260
it quickly but without knowing the

784
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,630
trapdoor information if the designer for

785
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,610
example forgot the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trapdoor number that</font>

786
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:58,950
was used he or<font color="#E5E5E5"> she could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not break it</font>

787
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,949
either the elliptic curve pseudo-random

788
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,630
number generator could easily have had a

789
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,980
trapdoor built into it that is if you

790
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,870
wanted to it would have been really easy

791
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,400
we don't know that that meant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

792
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,859
build a trap door into it but further

793
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,650
suspicion was centered on this elliptic

794
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,590
curve suit

795
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:17,230
the number generator because NSA the the

796
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:20,680
accusation and the papers was that NSA

797
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,020
had paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> RS a data security 20 million</font>

798
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:29,460
dollars to make it the default in there

799
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:33,159
be safe tool tool kit and I don't think

800
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,990
NSA went to RSA included with them that

801
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,489
RSA knowingly did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean with</font>

802
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:38,049
that's the NSA wouldn't do it that way

803
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:40,959
anyway they wouldn't trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> our a state</font>

804
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,730
but why they then pushed this one that

805
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,250
could have a trapdoor in it as the

806
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard is really an open important</font>

807
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,070
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think it's been</font>

808
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:53,290
fully answered does anybody know more

809
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:55,210
about that is not what effect and

810
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,409
probability do you see quantum computing

811
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,310
having on public key cryptography

812
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:02,560
quantum computing that's so scary so

813
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,330
basically a quantum computing is a whole

814
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,940
different kind of computing that works

815
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:10,540
it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the touring model</font>

816
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:12,460
and algorithms have been developed if

00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,930
and started<font color="#E5E5E5"> applying that I mean 10 to</font>

871
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:37,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10th all by itself cuts it down to a</font>

872
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:39,669
month parallel was a millionfold

873
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:42,280
parallelism cuts it down to seconds and

874
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,910
so when I went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I concluded</font>

875
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you want to apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

876
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,920
stringent level of security which i

877
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,000
think is should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be applied to any system</font>

878
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,430
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public key</font>

879
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,880
cryptography<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed key sizes even in</font>

880
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,430
1980 of at least four thousand bits to

881
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,160
have comfort<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years into the future</font>

882
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,598
have some hope of comfort and today it's

883
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,210
got to be even bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that and</font>

884
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:10,270
those key sizes just<font color="#CCCCCC"> get so huge that</font>

885
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,730
another major advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in factoring might</font>

886
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:15,339
make public key cryptography as we now

887
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,589
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than elliptic curves really</font>

888
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:19,540
unusable and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum</font>

889
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,630
computing is just kind of fits in with

890
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that same thing I already talked about</font>

891
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:28,050
advice for software developers trying to

892
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:31,830
learn proper cryptography

893
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:35,080
applied crypt I know if they're edition

894
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:38,020
that's a good I mean people I don't even

895
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,390
know about transport layers I mean so

896
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,980
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just I mean understanding how to</font>

897
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,180
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with algorithms is really</font>

898
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,850
different from understanding how to

899
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:50,430
implement this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay should we stop</font>

900
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:50,430
there David well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>

901
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,529
you
