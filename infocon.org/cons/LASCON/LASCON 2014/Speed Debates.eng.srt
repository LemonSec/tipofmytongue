participants may or may not represent

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,610
their real feelings there going to be

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,450
arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards a point but I will make</font>

19
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,980
the way we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work this since</font>

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,770
we have a look kind of larger group than

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,150
usual this year is they will you guys

22
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,000

00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,979
explain why the point is correct or then

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,950
the other team will oppose that position

29
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:20,390
it's two minutes each<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then each team</font>

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,300
gets to pick one person amongst their

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,429
team to do a one-minute rebuttal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,800
it'll be four against one-minute

33
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:29,840
rebuttal one minute revoke all right and

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,130
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just start since you guys have the</font>

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,850
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should probably find an app for</font>

that whatever no this is mobile security

47
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:12,769
why applause salveter's left the

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:18,870
building no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll press on yes</font>

49
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:22,620
all right well there's there's a voce

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,480
this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just just for you the</font>

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:31,950
single biggest problem in security is

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:34,519
the end user that's a favor I like it

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:41,070
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the real point I'll do it</font>

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:50,070
this is where you get picky talks there

55
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:51,030
are no real rules yes what we should so

56
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,540
much should be affirmative and negative

57
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:00,270
correct that works still let's do that

58
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:04,620
that's cool ok the question is big data

59
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,320
is the next security snake oil so one

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,880
side has to be affirmative to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ie it</font>

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,040
is the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day coal and other has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,799
defend that it is not the big that is

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,150
not snake oil so who would like this

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,150
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room to be on the</font>

65
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:24,500
affirmative<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

66
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,500
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room beyond the affirmative</font>

67
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,850
it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your nerves with you and</font>

68
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:36,850
applause honor

69
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:40,090
hardly required<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so who's going</font>

70
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,340
first for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go first</font>

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,740
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are negative you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you are you</font>

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,410
believe that big data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the next</font>

73
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,030
security snake oil I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

74
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,910
operative early they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the</font>

75
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,250
affirmative who votes for a new

76
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,620
moderator is running this thing exactly

77
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:01,810
who who<font color="#CCCCCC"> who votes for a beer for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

78
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:04,450
moderator so I'm sorry I got lost track

79
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's late in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day so you're the</font>

80
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,780
affirmative big data is the next

81
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,090
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> snake-oil who wants to take</font>

82
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:16,269
that for team this side we should really

83
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you guys names team Josh come on</font>

84
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:26,650
somebody somebody grow up and stand up

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:28,480
and take the mic so I'm great here for a

86
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,849
reason I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing code for 20</font>

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,850
years now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you call big data</font>

88
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,790
today we call data warehousing and many

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,800
other names<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same BS</font>

90
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,300
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different name different color</font>

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,340
different marketing wrapper and

92
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,840
unfortunately a different price tag

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,669
because the promises or even bigger

94
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,469
because you got to keep promising higher

95
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,900
with each new generation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

96
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,520
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the big data it's what you</font>

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,049
do with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same</font>

98
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem we've had since the beginning of</font>

99
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,580
organized data type machine so this is

100
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">just this more the same in a different</font>

101
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:08,490
nowhere near the two minutes but that's

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,490
cool follow up yeah yeah you got time

103
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:20,570
big garbage done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

104
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:24,210
synced before my esteemed colleague here

105
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:27,210
decides to explain why it is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of</font>

106
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,549
thought I'd like to just say that well

107
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,620
everybody thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can say oh</font>

108
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:41,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about the size all of you know</font>

109
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:43,910
that's a law please go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

110
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right let me lick beats about Heavy D</font>

111
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,170
Heavy D is pretty awesome it allows you

112
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,510
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of disparate data</font>

113
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,850
sources and actually soar through it it

114
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,960
actually gives you a chance in a hope of

115
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,170
actually knowing what the hell's going

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,849
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your enterprise and there's some</font>

117
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,100
pretty cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are</font>

118
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing with big data and if you aren't</font>

119
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing those things they will beat you to</font>

120
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,660
the exploit so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talking about</font>

121
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit tomorrow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the point is</font>

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,760
come and see me the point is if you

123
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,930
aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a big data analysis of even</font>

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,370
your own enterprise what you got

125
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,540
discovery scans basically and

126
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,520
identifying that you have

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,070
vulnerabilities you're effectively just

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,320
leaving yourself wide open to attack so

129
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,610
yes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it for sure</font>

130
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,750
because if you just log everything and

131
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,730
just throw it a data warehouse and never

132
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,160
touch it that's not going to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

133
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,470
it is a job creator but it is the kind

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:42,540
of job that actually does give you real

135
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:44,280
value we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one little at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

136
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,400
the day what they're trying to sell you

137
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,440
is snake oil big data is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,780
concept there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely nothing new</font>

139
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,969
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Big Data as Jim said these these</font>

140
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,549
were mainframes back in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

141
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,550
big databases it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing more than</font>

142
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,130
that so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robert says that you can</font>

143
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,020
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> some fancy shmancy analytics over it</font>

144
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,300
that's not big data they're trying to

145
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,479
sell you bigger hard drives bigger

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,100
databases things like that it's not any

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,249
different than what we've been doing for

148
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 years</font>

149
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:16,509
they're just slapping a new marketing

150
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:18,308
firm on and so when we're doing data

151
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,569
warehousing this is building very

152
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:24,609
scalable denormalized giant databases to

153
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,979
handle data from all these district

154
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:29,349
systems we would write code and slurping

155
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,869
engines to grab data from different data

156
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,089
sources even non commoditize datasources

157
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:36,309
back 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago a lot of our network</font>

158
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:39,099

159
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:40,689
so it's a no commoditized tool could

160
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily absorb and put it into our data</font>

creation technology we build a stuff by

<font color="#E5E5E5">from these different sources and then</font>

166
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,219
build applications to retrieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data</font>

in a variety of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm</font>

technical commentary that was going on

180
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:35,588
over there but I run an enterprise I

189
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,389
you guys work in companies where you

190
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,670
have so many resources that you can just

191
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:56,949
afford to have those type of people but

192
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,479
what big data does is it allows you to

193
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:00,459
centralize the ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a single</font>

286
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,370
some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'm gonna just say that</font>

287
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,319
Chris earlier today's keynote talked

288
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,150
about how we have to embrace<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

289
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,090
we have to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like they're</font>

290
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,130
special like like they matter and I took

291
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,170
that to heart and because I took that to

292
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,240
heart I really feel like we we just

293
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't kill off these protocols like that</font>

294
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,020
we have to socialize this with the users

295
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,880
we have to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them about the</font>

296
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,740
ramifications and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

297
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,900
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe someday down the road when</font>

298
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,060
everybody agrees on this then we can

299
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,090
kill it off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now today no we</font>

300
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,699
can't do that thanks Chris thank you for

301
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,350
changing thank you one-minute rebuttal

302
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,660
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your strawman</font>

303
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,880
article argument we never said anything

304
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">about killing anybody so now you're</font>

305
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,020
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the focus away from you</font>

306
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,700
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at hand so we're</font>

307
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,560
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Darwinism which is</font>

308
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,790
evolutions four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fittest</font>

309
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,069
not execution so the users will police

310
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,110
themselves the strong ones will connect

311
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website they will help other</font>

312
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,670
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like he said in his talk</font>

313
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,410
that you know they will share and

314
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,819
educate each other and they will upgrade

315
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,559
themselves and be fine

316
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:56,179
and gentlemen there's this other thing

317
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,269
called browser supporting multiple

318
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:00,759
protocols for you IE<font color="#CCCCCC"> six folks stuck in</font>

319
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,709
that world you can live in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of</font>

320
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,889
HTTP 1.1 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the problems that come</font>

321
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:08,238
with it for those of us who want<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

322
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,729
just because your cup makes a secure

323
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:12,229
browser and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font>

324
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:14,059
and push that secure browser out to

325
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:30,799
people by playing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side it does</font>

326
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:33,169
not mean that you're wrong rebuttal sit

327
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,049
I mean it you said it's a strong man<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

328
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,579
so if it were indeed is from an argument

329
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,319
you would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

330
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,179
actually life critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes over</font>

331
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:44,599
SSL oh i don't know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care</font>

332
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:46,309
information or like MRI machines or

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,869
political dissidents who need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

334
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">to communicate over secure protocols and</font>

335
00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,859
who can't update for whatever reason

336
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,970
there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons possibly</font>

337
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,410
because they're in a country who might

338
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,079
actually give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> our instead of the</font>

339
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,819
update they want so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you</font>

340
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,649
could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no life at risk</font>

341
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,649
and then you'd say the cryptography is

342
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:05,239
not actually useful thank you and you

343
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:06,859
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evolution right it's not</font>

344
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,119
killing the users<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evolution well</font>

345
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:10,819
when is evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in a</font>

346
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:12,169
single generation okay all right we're

347
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,849
gonna we're gonna have some seriously

348
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:16,850
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are using small</font>

349
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,559
browsers and hey it sounds sounds to me

350
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,269
still like killing right look look the

351
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:25,549
reality is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl 30 hey let's be honest</font>

352
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,019
poodle is a bitch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to have</font>

353
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:29,659
man the mill in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it useful</font>

354
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,609
anyways so let's let's keep the users I

355
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:33,130
think we should end on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moodle as a bitch</font>

356
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:42,530
yeah

357
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:53,150
applause auditor all right who believes

358
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this side won the debate and this</font>

359

tied 1-1 huh we will always we had a

361
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:25,850
trader on our team their team member it

362
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a highly effective plan time</font>

363
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,860
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> serena's almost like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl upgrade</font>

364
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,879
nice nice nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so now gosh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

365
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:43,090
bound behind uterus your affirmative and

366
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">your negative ok the statement is docker</font>

367
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,419
containers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro services will</font>

368
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,790
dramatically increase software security

369
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,390
dr. containers and micro services will

370
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,820
significantly increase or dramatically

371
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,470
you believe this I believes that docker

372
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,149
containers and micro services will

373
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,150
dramatically increase software security

374
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,500
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I will say one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing all</font>

375
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,700
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will say one thing sure i think</font>

376
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,050
the word dramatically is what's making

377
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,020
me stay away from this<font color="#CCCCCC"> question right</font>

378
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,809
but like mad all set on a run today LCA

379
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,580
it might increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the one thing</font>

380
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor does allow us to do is it</font>

381
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,770
does allow companies that could not do

382
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,960
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix architecture type of</font>

383
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,300
thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't these</font>

384
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,860
gentle fragile servers that you put up

385
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">on this pedestal and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you never touch</font>

386
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,709
ever because you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

387
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,379
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you touch it and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

388
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,780
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> right with dr. it allows kind of</font>

389
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,210
the common folk if you will you know you

390
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a Netflix size budget</font>

391
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,530
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing you can make</font>

392
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,149
these servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I could just</font>

393
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,830
kill this thing real quick spin up a new

394
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:00,230
one and here you go and its provision

395
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,820
it's not this fragile server that only

396
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,380
does this one thing only does this one

397
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,149
thing well alright it becomes really

398
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,970
really easy to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a docker file you</font>

399
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,290
know to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> spin up like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's</font>

400
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,030
all my servers there behind my load

401
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,770
balancer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have an update to push okay</font>

402
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">push the update push a new server kill a</font>

403
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,710
server pushing a new server killer

404
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,450
server right this is kind of thing that

405
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really only netflix has been doing until</font>

406
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,380
recently and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctors making it</font>

407
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,480
possible for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more people yeah I</font>

408
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's right and I don't know</font>

409
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,300
about dramatically but I do think that

410
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,420
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to operationalize security</font>

411
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,700
that way like distributed across a whole

412
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,380
bunch of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and capture it in scripts</font>

413
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,390
as opposed to having manual hardening

414
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:42,890
procedures first stuff is really

415
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,050
important it allows security as software

416
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,330
in a sulfur-based networking software

417
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:51,050
based security is I think potentially

418
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,250
really transformative ice you have 15

419
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,450
more seconds and thank you for saving

420
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:59,510
this question by the way more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sake if</font>

421
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,830
you got 35 seconds actually ok again

422
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,910
dramatically is probably wrong word but

423
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,800
there's some pretty cool stuff you can

424
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,690
do if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can spin up and spin down</font>

425
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,889
service programmatically so if you for

426
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,540
instance know you're under denial

427
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,190
service attack you can spin up a bunch

428
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,190
of servers to sort of handle that load

429
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,020
or if you think that you know there's a

430
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular type of attack that's more of</font>

431
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,400
like a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like it's trying to</font>

432
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,840
identify certain types of attributes

433
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,550
about the site you can sort of shunt

434
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,350
that traffic off into his own container

435
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,110
so it's sort of attacking an isolated

436
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,730
incident incident incident am I trying

437
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:30,139
to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were there trying</font>

438
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,780
spins you all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

439
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:36,170
incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever you based what's that</font>

440
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:38,629
incense<font color="#CCCCCC"> be PPP that would be your time</font>

441
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,710
well just briefly yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually don't</font>

442
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we're gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for us so but</font>

443
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,800
whatever yeah yeah yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are</font>

444
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,090
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to win this one but but</font>

445
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,320
it's kind of nice because you can kind

446
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,840
of shut people off into the other

447
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,370
location which were there safe their

448
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,389
credentials aren't necessarily share its

449
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,979
heart of a brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force and get</font>

450
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,330
information sharing across I wouldn't

451
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that's romantic though that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

452
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:05,300
another evolution I think the big the

453
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,530
big downside of micro servers is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

454
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,240
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that efficient for the large</font>

455
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,649
enterprise if you have small jobs that

456
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,420
you're firing up once<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while on a small</font>

457
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,590
business media business that's great we

458
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">you live in the world of the enterprise</font>

459
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:17,449
where we're running servers 24-7 at high

460
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,120
cpu utilization and in those world

461
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,480
microservers is not it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

462
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,479
working

463
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,320
you guys have a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time lift if</font>

464
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,970
you'd like to expound I actually had a

465
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,129
talk here today that was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

466
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about security using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux</font>

467
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:48,430
containers and I dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I</font>

468
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:50,400
had nothing good to say about so

469
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:54,250
counters boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> counterpoint obviously</font>

470
00:21:50,400 --> 00:22:00,120
we little tongue you can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font>

471
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that yourself sure everything yeah hi um</font>

472
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,129
so look you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about enterprise</font>

473
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,720
scalability right or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

474
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you pretend to talk about even</font>

475
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,850
though you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in a big enterprise um</font>

476
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,980
those of us who are in big enterprises

477
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,500
know based on our experience in

478
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,110
computing from the 60s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 70s that</font>

479
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,560
things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know uh-oh have you ever</font>

480
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,669
worked on an RS 9,000 before IBM oh you

481
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,290
don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is yeah that's an</font>

482
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,290
enterprise scalability stuff I write

483
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,909
software for a living so you have no

484
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,360
foundation in this debate what so I'm

485
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:36,040
not not even a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit hey i</font>

486
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,840
twittered something or not cool that's

487
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,950
awful i'm reading some well I appreciate

488
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,500
your ignorant equation they go again I'd

489
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that that architecture</font>

490
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,850
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rs 9,000 is what these services</font>

491
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,920
are built upon right being able to

492
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,240
component eyes being able to modernize

493
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,920
what's going on in the environment while

494
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,780
still staying operational is how

495
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,480
enterprises run that's how the big boys

496
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,520
play<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have evolutionary paths</font>

497
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,500
now we already understood how evolution

498
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,760
works from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last debate so if you</font>

499
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to refer to that I'm sure it's</font>

500
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,879
recorded but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

501
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,449
is that these services provide

502
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,370
enterprise scalability at a level that

503
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,900
must be attained otherwise if you're

504
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,760
trying to component eyes the service and

505
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,250
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to each one of them you'll</font>

docker container that secures your data

517

from all the other data that every other

518
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
user on that system is doing at the end

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day I would feel safer in the</font>

522
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:09,699
of who's on what side now remember much

523
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,290
all right look you guys might have

524
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,020
things in the enterprise class but did

525
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,330
anybody go to Turkey and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gates was talk</font>

526
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,100
did you see all the problems that are in

527
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,139
Redis and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> micro services every</font>

528
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you push it back out it's pushing</font>

out freaking default ssh keys are you

530
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,010
kidding me you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think how that's security</font>

531
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,860
scales in life by pushing out the faults

532

that are widely known public items<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

533
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,490
what are you talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like I'm</font>

534
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,170
sorry that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might not have any</font>

535
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,000
security experience and you're worried

536
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the enterprise but we're here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,730
security conference trying to figure out

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">how to make things better plus I don't</font>

539
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:50,559
trust anything that's named after an

540

ugly pair of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants well said Wilson well</font>

544
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:02,230
yes yeah well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could say the team that</font>

545
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,139
had Chris Dickerson on it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

546
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:10,450
really uh how about this side for

547
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,740
winning the debate oh my well we might

548
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,070
know what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I point to this</font>

549
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,070
side

550
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,010
right so we're 21 now and moving on to

551
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:27,300
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is who are the hell</font>

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:29,820
knows I always take these please<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">right next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question this is a nice this</font>

554
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a nice short brief statement is it</font>

555
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually about application security no</font>

556
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:42,710
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> not are you go for three in</font>

557
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> debate what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hell am i doing it</font>

558
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:50,160
entertaining hello I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce the</font>

559
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,590
affirmative you worthy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your</font>

560
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,970
affirmative now so the statement is

561
00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:06,929
Edward Snowden is a hero you're in the

562

affirmative your affirmative and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

563

negative so who would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

564
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">first argument for the affirmative oh</font>

565

going or shall I this is a hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> one even</font>

569
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,850
though this was my idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I this is</font>

570
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a yes your idea um affirmative</font>

571
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,320
now hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

572
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:46,790
to frame it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so think of all the people</font>

573
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> irritate you would speak for them</font>

574
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,880
the thing that he did do regardless of

575
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,500
how he did it is that he opened up the

576
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,220
doors to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conversations around</font>

577
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,310
surveillance and privacy and data and

578
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,770
anonymity that now is creating

579
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,240
opportunities for general users to step

580
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:11,420
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say what does this all mean for</font>

581
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:15,960
me so regardless if you disagree with

582
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:19,550
exactly how he did it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

583
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,550
are elements of heroism

584
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:30,930
coming out of my mouth what is that bad

585
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:34,050
taste there are positive lessons to

586
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:37,590
glean from that experience that way to

587
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:41,340
go girl however through this come on

588
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:45,810
even doing it the boys<font color="#CCCCCC"> clever and none</font>

589
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you can say anything so so they're so</font>

590
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:51,870
but we do have opportunities for greater

591
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:55,200
discussions thanks to the work that he

592
00:27:51,870 --> 00:28:03,000
did and what he brought to hand the mic

593
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:05,070
across the islands so<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative Snowden</font>

594
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brook like a zillion laws right he's a</font>

595
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:12,169
criminal the we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> process probably</font>

596
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,169
not a zillion by the way wasn't that

597
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:24,420
since when has that been a problem for

598
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:27,540
you yeah that's like a zillion laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

599
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,850
bring a white count so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we have</font>

600
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,370
process and we have a system laws in

601
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,590
this country and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improve</font>

602
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,389
things you don't have to just go apeshit

603
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:42,439
crazy and steal all of our country

604
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:42,440
secrets and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give him give him out like</font>

605
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:52,260
candy on Halloween right there yeah hey

606
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,570
Edward Snowden is a criminal he broke

607
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,550
laws at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that we're not</font>

608
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,830
debating if he's a criminal educating if

609
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,500
he's a hero at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day if you</font>

610
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,540
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data that he exposed that</font>

611
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,460
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now in the hands of every single</font>

612
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">other country around the world that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

613
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">now see the things that our government</font>

614
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,100
was doing to protect its citizens

615
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,100
protect its military to protect our

616
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,659
country and so by nature of exposing

617
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,219
every single thing that our government

618
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,930
is doing he has put that day in the

619
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,210
hands of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemies and he has put</font>

620
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,580
lives of American citizens American

621
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,490
soldiers every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single person in this</font>

622
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,389
room at risk Edward<font color="#CCCCCC"> Snowden is not a</font>

623
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:32,250
hero he's a criminal nothing more look

624
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're untrained musicians</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in</font>

625
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,780
2010 release even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's digital</font>

626
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,340
download was an awful awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> album I</font>

627
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,230
don't know where these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn to</font>

628
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,669
play guitar snowed in the band of course

629
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an indie rock band fronted by</font>

630
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:46,350
musician and songwriter Jordan Jefferies

631
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:50,030
and I just think it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is way</font>

632
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,260
better music out there in 2014 thank you

633
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Monaco is firmly established that Edward</font>

634
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,440
Snowden is not a guitar hero<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the</font>

635
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,420
killer first of all we're not debating

636
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,450
whether nice a criminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> you broke laws</font>

637
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,920
so that point is totally squashed over

638
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,260
here what we're debating is whether or

639
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,140
not he added value to the conversation

640
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,940
around security which we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in turn</font>

641
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">or now we're debating whether is a hero</font>

642
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:28,020
well yeah yeah that's doubtful<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay fair</font>

643
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:29,970
enough and then I lost my Edward Snowden

644
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,650
didn't add any more value than Snowden

645
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:36,480
the band-aid how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have</font>

646
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:38,940
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them yeah no bail so as part of</font>

647
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,970
what he uncovered was the government

648
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,310
actively spying upon its own citizens

649
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:46,950
which i believe is unethical immoral and

650
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:49,379
illegal so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see anything that he</font>

651
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,880
did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong in that regard that is to</font>

652
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:56,210
me the equivalent of a whistleblower and

653
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,710
we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a clear sense of what</font>

654
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,810
exactly was leaked there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

655
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,170
speculation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no affirmative</font>

656
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:05,669
reports of exactly what was provided so

657
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,590
you know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Hollywood</font>

658
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:09,630
stories out there that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> making more</font>

659
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this in my opinion then there needs</font>

660
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,330
to be but it shines an important light

661
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,470
on security and that's what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

662
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,580
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would participate but</font>

663
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,970
that

664
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:24,060
sparred my participation we all know

665
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,410
that he worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA right and we</font>

666
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,620
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the NSA has</font>

667
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,930
counterintelligence operations right and

668
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,870
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that the LSA runs NSA runs</font>

669
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:46,920
games in order to gamify the system in

670
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:49,020
order to gain more control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us so what</font>

671
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,310
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> polarized us against single</font>

672
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:56,790
common enemy than to gain this man it's

673
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:59,730
a hero because he is the one

674
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> took one for the team so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

675
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they want to</font>

676
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,670
provide can actually get there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

677
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,260
they can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our traffic not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

678
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,060
a little bit they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

679
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">common enemy that everybody was like</font>

680
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:18,149
whoa so that we could automatically take

681
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:19,470
hold and secure this country that just

682
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,990
got a little weird for me but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

683
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,980
do respect the way that he dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

684
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,590
the problem like you saw an

685
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,190
insurmountable problem in his eyes and

686
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,580
he hacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system I mean he found</font>

687
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,200
loopholes in that system that he was

688
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,629
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit and I think everyone in</font>

689
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,540
here is doing exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay imma we have</font>

690
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,850
time for a Bubba he's figured out a way

691
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,300
to get out so the question on the table

692
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,620
is is snowed in a hero and we're gonna

693
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,110
say no over here and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

694
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,600
why now did the results of what he did

695
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:56,850
lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some good in society maybe</font>

696
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,409
that's debatable<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

697
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,330
he a hero let's look what he did he

698
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,700
dumped a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information got in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

699
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,990
plane<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran away as quickly as he could</font>

700
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,659
hiding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mountains somewhere in</font>

701
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:09,909
Russia I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> any story in</font>

702
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:12,669
history where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hero and a mighty</font>

703
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:14,830
warrior runs in hide behind a mountain

704
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:18,100
from his enemies that's not what a hero

705
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,199
is and look they use the term

706
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,539
whistleblower there are whistleblower

707
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,659
laws in this country for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reason there</font>

708
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:27,309
are proper ways that person can blow the

709
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:29,620
whistle on their government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

710
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,470
Edwards knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not follow that Andy</font>

711
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,360
things work absolutely that's what those

712
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,880
laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there if you talk to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

713
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:40,449
people those laws would work but Snowden

714
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,429
instead chose to deceive you tried to go

715
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:44,289
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper channels that's like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">saying when you find an ode a horrible</font>

717
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,679
you should release it to the world

718
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make life so much</font>

719
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:56,710
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> right we don't do that</font>

720
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,720
responsible disclosure man<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we found a</font>

721
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,159
one more thing we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back in</font>

722
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,740
history think of all the heroes in

723
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,799
history there's only one hero in history

724
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,710
that bravely ran away and that was from

725
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:12,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monty Python multi bravely right away</font>

726
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:16,440
that does not fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hero's story every</font>

727
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:22,649
hero in history broke laws every hero

728
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:28,000
everyone broke the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nah not Ghandi oh</font>

729
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:32,020
wait which one's got exiled Oh history's

730
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,719
hard isn't it Dali Lama ran away you do

731
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:38,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so well David all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right who</font>

732
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:40,319
believes this side of the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> won the</font>

00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,319
debate

734
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:50,879
and those who have mercy in their hearts

please vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this side those are the</font>

736
00:34:50,879 --> 00:35:00,420
real hatred that was interesting that

737
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:09,690
actually does not turn out how I I hope

738
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:17,940
you all<font color="#E5E5E5"> can leave this tell us how you</font>

739
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:23,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">really feel I figured as much alright</font>

740
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">who I don't remember reasoning for guys</font>

741
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,049
you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the affirmative well you</font>

742
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:32,069
don't wait till I read the thing you

743
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:35,630
might get<font color="#CCCCCC"> one oh there we go you've got</font>

744
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:39,569
one now all right for the affirmative

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:49,848
replaced affirmative signature based

security signature based security

749
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:55,979
specifically I did say signature-based

750
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:57,839
hey you got a softball last night a

751
00:35:55,979 --> 00:36:00,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">little baby you know come on signature</font>

base security AV wife ids is dead and

753
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:06,180
should be ripped out and replaced who

754
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:07,739
wants to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> go go affirmative yeah so</font>

755
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,019
you know signature based security used

756
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,359
to be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool it when protocols</font>

757
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:15,049
were really simple the web start now

758
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:17,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple HTTP requests with readable</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look at and see some simple attacks and</font>

761
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:25,049
it sort of worked a little bit but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

762
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:28,229
ship has sailed applications today are

763
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:31,109
super complicated it's not straight up

764
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:33,450
web traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's serialized objects</font>

the data formats or cuss

768
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:42,009
anybody looked at GWT traffic lately

769
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,250
it's ridiculous and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a that's</font>

a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> one protocols are impossible to</font>

771
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,740
look into and primitive protections that

772
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:54,040
do signature-based detection the

773
00:36:50,740 --> 00:37:02,080
signature approach just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

774
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:10,270
anymore sorry company by his favorite

775
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:11,860
mints hey guys there's this tool called

776
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,620
mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip I think you've heard of it</font>

777
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,930
this tool is capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking a piece</font>

778
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:21,790
of malware they throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in changing the</font>

779
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:23,710
signature and and by nature of changing

780
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,800
that signature you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically render all</font>

781
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:29,470
that old antivirus crap obsolete so when

782
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,480
Mac becomes calling whatever you turn

783
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,520
the way you say no I'm not interesting

784
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,200
that signature-based detection I want

785
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,640
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's dynamic that'll</font>

786
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,230
actually launched this in a virtual

787
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,180
machine tell me what this thing is

788
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,740
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing because that is really</font>

789
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only way that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

790
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to detect whether it's now or not</font>

791
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,890
signature-based detection is dead it's

792
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,540
gone the way of the dinosaurs and even

793
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,839
those companies know it because they're

794
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,670
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into other ways to make money</font>

795
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,360
look at economics as well give you on

796
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">mic with 16 seconds just say the cost</font>

797
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,160
the cost to to buy custom malware that

798
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,780
will evade modern AV used to be an

799
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,730
incredibly expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray market</font>

800
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,890
purchase it's like couple grand these

801
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,900
days so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just a basic economics</font>

802
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,060
of hiring people who can bypass AV it's

803
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:18,310
incredibly cheap because it's incredibly

804
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:21,700
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the negative what's the</font>

805
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:24,670
negative oh you like signature-based

806
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,910
detection of course is pretty oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

807
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:30,340
gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an easy one thank you oh dude</font>

808
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,649
there's there's there's a language

809
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,980
problem that I think we're having here

810
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:38,680
so a signature right is something that

811
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,720
is verifiable path yeah we understand

812
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,000
that like like my signature means that

813
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,649
it's me their signature means that it's

814
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,260
them now behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are signature right</font>

815
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,180
the way something responds in acts

816
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,740
is a signature you know that when all

817
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,290
the physicists took a look at skype and

818
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,870
understood how to deconstruct skype and

819
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:01,360
decrypt it it wasn't a conventional

820
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,730
based attack what they did is they took

821
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,650
polarity of the packet size and they

822
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,720
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and over time be</font>

823
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,460
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze up behavior and by</font>

824
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,379
analyzing that behavior they could tell

825
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,090
when they set a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain word the packet</font>

826
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,770
variance would be a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> way jitter</font>

827
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,220
would happen a certain way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

828
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,870
behavior those behaviors were signatures

829
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,910
that were used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrypt that process</font>

830
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,190
right and as they apply those signature

831
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,980
sets to it they found those behaviors

832
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,290
which were bad now I understand that we

833
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,750
have old versions of signatures which is

834
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:33,100
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than a regex but what we're</font>

835
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,500
talking about is a behavior based

836
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,270
approach in the new data world in the

837
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,580
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> of big data analytics where you're</font>

838
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,020
not going to be able to have these

839
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,340
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on your machine you're</font>

840
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,170
not going to have the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

841
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,640
malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department where they look at</font>

842
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,500
everything individually because they're

843
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,210
super smart you need to be able to take

844
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,460
the signature behavior of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

845
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,720
products work and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply that</font>

846
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,730
to your enterprise so that you can

847
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue supporting your enterprise</font>

848
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,020
right we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money we have</font>

849
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,300
survived we have to live and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

850
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:03,790
way that we can do that is by analyzing

851
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,560
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> common denominator is and using</font>

852
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:10,060
those specific methods to protect

853
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,360
ourselves how much time together you got

854
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:15,610
40 seconds okay so an actual practical

855
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,590
thing that actually has happened people

856
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,430
are going to say antivirus and I think

857
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,320
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

858
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">first of all it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have to be a</font>

859
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,590
paid antivirus it can be there's free

860
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,810
stuff out there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so take the cost</font>

861
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,310
part of it for a second maybe there's a

862
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,279
cost in CPU time or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

863
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,960
the only real cost so I've actually run

864
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,000
into situations where Pete I've got my

865
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,510
own customers uploading malware to the

866
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,280
site from a previous install and you

867
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,720
know what am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like access</font>

868
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,610
controls that's not going to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

869
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,740
firewall that's going to help right it

870
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,670
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus of all things in</font>

871
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world like you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking like</font>

872
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:51,340
that's not the worst possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing out</font>

873
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,680
there yeah well the point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

874
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,360
something as crappy as antivirus does

875
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,759
offer some security benefit in these

876
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,920
weird scenarios eat even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though crappy</font>

877
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,140
is signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dumbest thing if it</font>

878
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,150
provides even<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

879
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,150
without malware it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of worth hat</font>

880
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:12,960
what rebuttal I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's right</font>

881
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:15,869
I don't think no it actually did happen

882
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,760
what trying to protect one out of 100 is

883
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,799
not the goal right if you're gonna

884
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,369
you've got limited resources in security

885
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:26,400
to spend because<font color="#CCCCCC"> does nothing by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

886
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:27,480
hogwash it's free it's actually free so

887
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,430
it didn't take you any time to install

888
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,230
or configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> but no boy your monitor or</font>

889
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:35,910
anything no it's all baked in default

890
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:41,279
yeah packaged app you're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right</font>

891
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:43,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">so look really let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's back up to</font>

892
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:47,160
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> order but that mom Susan</font>

893
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,720
everything everything's a signature is

894
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,240
that your argument like oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

895
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,439
it's not just specific reg X's or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

896
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,368
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a level we could say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's</font>

897
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">not this pattern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fight you agree no</font>

898
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:00,569
well I'm saying you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

899
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,700
your argument that everything is a

900
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:04,259
signature like every kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack</font>

901
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,819
that's possible as a signature so by

902
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,970
default then signature-based detection

903
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:10,470
is perfect behavior-based that's a

904
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:14,058
signature you have to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signature</font>

905
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:16,410
in order to identify the behavior so I

906
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:17,880
you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie The Incredibles</font>

907
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,549
where they say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen it every</font>

908
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">week sooner than no one is else do you</font>

909
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:23,490
have ODU of a solution because we have

910
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:25,890
solutions for our problems do you guys

911
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,379
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one you didn't have one</font>

912
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:31,288
behavior-based the intrusion detection

913
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:34,170
is a thing it's not signature pigs the

914
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:35,730
reason oh it is if you and everything as

915
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,019
a signature then yeah you're right but

916
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,640
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ridiculous that way you don't</font>

917
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,839
have custom use cases that define

918
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,220
whether the behavior is good or not

919
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,640
because that custom use case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

920
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,189
specific signature you right oh snap<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

921
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,868
signatures procedural in your head<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

922
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you know can it be a</font>

923
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:54,210
sequence of severe algorithm it can be

924
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,020
sure everything is a signature huh how

925
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,290
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thank you</font>

926
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:02,890
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature based security in</font>

927
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">parentheses AV whap IDs is dead and</font>

928
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,879
should be ripped replays we're not

929
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,190
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about behavioral analysis you're</font>

930
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,710
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> old-school antivirus web</font>

application firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs you're talking</font>

932
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:16,210
about taking a series of packets on the

00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,830
wire running a hash algorithm coming

934
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,720
back with the signature and then write

935
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:23,110
that against a list in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> database of</font>

936
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,950
bad stuff in our case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

937
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:29,520

then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a debate</font>

939
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:39,870
signature-based detection is that

940
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:43,270
behavioral detection is where it's at so

941
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:45,190
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do any of it do any av's or</font>

your card do behavior-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i</font>

944
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:55,690
know some that do so we've had signature

<font color="#E5E5E5">beta so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying we can Jeff this</font>

946
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,440
is awesome i didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> app sec was so</font>

947
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,120
easy we can give up secure coding we can

948
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,010
give up building secure software let

949
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,380
developers write the crappiest garbage

950
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,940
out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> almighty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nickerson and his</font>

web application firewalls and his

952
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,030
signatures are going to solve the

953
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,180
problem we're done I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

954
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,860
was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> though we've had survey stools</font>

955
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,569
for 20 years and you're saying we should

956
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,430
just throw that out while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

957
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:24,700
basically making the same argument as

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:26,290
the AXA anti-vaccination oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

959

up applause on our way to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it</font>

960

961
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,930
get infected with a pc now stone we

962
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,940
shouldn't check for it anymore why not

963
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,770
no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just grateful because I thought</font>

964
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that software security was hard work and</font>

signatures and all that everything is

969
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,250
yeah

that one's loud slap on some signatures

974
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:15,480
who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slap for the out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

that ends our exciting action-packed and

highly informative speed debate I'm sure

980
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,000
your security programs will radically

change after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session escom so you</font>

can skip tomorrow and go have fun no no

00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:49,380
don't skip tomorrow on you know given by
