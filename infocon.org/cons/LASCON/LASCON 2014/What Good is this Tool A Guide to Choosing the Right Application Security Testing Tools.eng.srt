1
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,040
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you about</font>

2
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:25,160
application security testing tools so

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,650
Who am I I Kevin feely we're good aspect

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,110
security this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my sixth year there I'm</font>

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,180
that the lead of aspect security

6
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,750
automation division so basically my

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,300
focus is on any type of tool

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:41,180
streamlining processes automation in

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,830
general and I like to think that you

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,260
know I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer science degree</font>

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,190
and an MBA so I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think that I can</font>

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of bridge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gap between</font>

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,320
technology and business so kind of on

14
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:53,870
the heels of that this presentation is

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,489
not super technical so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">techy I apologize for that it's a little</font>

17
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,980
bit higher level but I think it's pretty

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,379
interesting so the key takeaways here

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,349
are the differences between static

20
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,600
analysis dynamic analysis and

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:11,509
interactive analysis tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> for choosing</font>

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,759
the right tools and<font color="#CCCCCC"> tips for choosing</font>

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,260
the right integration points so real

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,290
quick just to get a quick understanding

25
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,950
how many people are pretty familiar with

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,370
Seth desk and I ask all three yeah about

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the two how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are</font>

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:31,130
actually using these tools okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

29
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,710
many people are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of decision makers</font>

30
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,350
in your security realm to to decide

31
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,690
which two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be using alright</font>

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,410
great so hopefully this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

33
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:44,000
useful so first why do we need tools

34
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,830
well more applications keep being

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,330
written every day obviously they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

36
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,130
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop more web applications</font>

37
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,940
mobile applications and applications for

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,710
other platforms and vulnerabilities

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,780
continue to be introduced into those

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,369
applications a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people here have</font>

41
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,720
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old vulnerabilities</font>

42
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,950
that have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decades are</font>

43
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,360
still being written into new

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,800
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as new</font>

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,200
vulnerabilities being discovered every

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,239
day and apps like budgets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really aren't</font>

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,470
changing very much unfortunately

48
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,090
absolute budgets make up a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

49
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,819
percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall security</font>

50
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,060
budget in most organizations so we need

51
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scale our appt sec and</font>

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,590
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better we need to be more</font>

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
efficient tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think are at least</font>

54
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,150
part of that answer so here's a you know

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,310
a quick overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types of</font>

56
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,480
application security testing tools so

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go through this pretty quickly it</font>

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,500
seemed like people had a pretty good

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,720
understanding so on the Left we have a

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,720
dynamic analysis tour desk<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,180
that's black box testing that's really

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,739
simulating what a hacker would do if

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,870
they're attacking your website it's

64
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,390
sending HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests getting HTTP</font>

65
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,239
responses back and trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

66
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,000
break the live running website<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

67
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,780
there's static analysis which is usually

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,430
called white box testing and that's can

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,940
can analyze the source code of an

70
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">application or it might analyze the</font>

71
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,049
compiled binaries or compile<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytecode of</font>

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,940
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application to look for</font>

73
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,280
vulnerabilities there so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,709
find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices here and</font>

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,599
it's simulating the running of an

76
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,069
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's an important</font>

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,630
distinction for static analysis is that

78
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's static you're not you're not</font>

79
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,959
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a running application you</font>

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,518
don't need it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be running and</font>

81
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,680
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked is</font>

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,290
interesting because it's relatively new

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,720
it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed up about three or four</font>

84
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,130
years ago and there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,930
different implementations for it it's

86
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,140
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know a new buzzword all</font>

87
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,430
right so everyone has an is<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution but</font>

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,130
I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of broken it up into two</font>

89
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups the first is hybrid analysis</font>

90
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,280
which is usually using both static

91
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,390
analysis and dynamic analysis together

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,239
correlating the results we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,890
output<font color="#CCCCCC"> from one of those tools as input</font>

94
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,250
to another tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make them better</font>

95
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,958
right so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a vulnerability</font>

96
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,930
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> your static analysis tool can you</font>

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,120
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information to confirm that</font>

98
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,620
there's a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability by sending</font>

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information to your dynamic</font>

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,180
analysis tool to actually find the

101
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,190
exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and there are a few other</font>

102
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,200
different implementations of that the

103
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,238
other the other side of I asked is

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,668
instrumentation so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure many of you</font>

105
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,909
heard Jeff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Williams speak today contrast</font>

106
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,650
is one of two instrumentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools on</font>

107
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,240
the market the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other i believe it's</font>

108
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,979
pronounced quote iam sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm</font>

109
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,200
pronouncing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wrong but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

110
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,120
called quo diem those are two

111
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,729
instrumentation tools the difference is

112
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,010
that instrumentation actually sits in

113
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,960
the runtime right it's not doing static

114
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,250
analysis or dynamic analysis it's

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,248
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the runtime and kind of doing</font>

116
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,969
both

117
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:48,819
so it's watching all of your commands

118
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:51,369
being executed it's watching your HTTP

119
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">request your HTTP responses sitting in</font>

120
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:54,819
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see everything the entire</font>

121
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,759
application right so if you've ever used

122
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:00,369
a debugger if your developer basically

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,379
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked is except it's looking for</font>

124
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:06,699
things not just showing you everything

125
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:08,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right and then on the other side</font>

126
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,939
there's rasp I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really talk about</font>

127
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:13,149
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just put it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there because</font>

128
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:15,039
people often group it in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> i asked or</font>

129
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:17,860
people talk about rest which is run time

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,169
analysis very similar so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just to</font>

131
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,079
kind of clarify rest is actual

132
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,209
protection so it's like I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> + making</font>

133
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:29,829
changes to things in memory to try to

134
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect you so it's better a hammer or</font>

135
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,329
screwdriver<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright what's better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SAS</font>

136
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">desk eyes it really depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it</font>

137
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:39,969
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the problem is so kind</font>

138
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:41,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a doctor who leaked so let's better a</font>

139
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:46,360
hammer or a sonic screwdriver obviously

140
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:48,849
a sonic screwdriver so pop some popular

141
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,349
AST tool vendors this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

142
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,610
Gartner Magic Quadrant if you're

143
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,659
familiar with that every year Gartner

144
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,619
puts out a ton of different

145
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:59,649
documentation a ton of different

146
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:01,659
research analysis on the industry and so

147
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just one of them this is the</font>

148
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the one from this year on</font>

149
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,818
application security testing so they go

150
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,378
out and they look at all of the

151
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,360
application security testing tools on

152
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:13,389
the market and they evaluate them and

153
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,519
they put out this report which if you're

154
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:17,319
a gardener subscriber you can get and

155
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,969
most of these vendors will just buy a

156
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,860
bunch of licenses or a bunch of copies

157
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,139
and you can download<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for free on most</font>

158
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,789
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their websites also so if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

159
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,799
starting out and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a</font>

160
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,628
tool and you don't know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who a</font>

161
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:31,328
good vendor is aside from the ones you

162
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,860
see at these conferences going to the

163
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:35,349
Gartner Magic Quadrant is a good place

164
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,729
to look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they battle a good list of</font>

165
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,149
the feature sets of all these

166
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,099
application all these vendors but those

167
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,199
aren't the only vendors out there and

168
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:45,998
this is important because the only

169
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,049
vendors out there are not the commercial

170
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:53,679
big spend vendors right of course

171
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:55,460
there's there's IBM and HP and bear code

172
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:57,440
and and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones</font>

173
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,138
very expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools and their grit and</font>

174
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,030
they do their job but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

175
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,539
tools these are open source tools right

176
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,448
you can use PMD or sonar cube which are

177
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,650
typically used as code quality tools

178
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so they're not typically used as</font>

179
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:17,239
security tools but they allow you to

180
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:18,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">write rules that evaluate the code so</font>

181
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can write security rules and we've</font>

182
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:22,909
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for some of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

183
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,008
right so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to branch out</font>

184
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,750
and look at other tools consider what

185
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,340
you have already consider what you are

186
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,300
already using and consider at least

187
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:36,049
piloting a new program using free end

188
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,400
ideally open source tools and then you

189
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">could always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on to other vendors</font>

190
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,489
after that but before contacting a

191
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,930
vendor right consider which tools are

192
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,820
most compatible with your applications

193
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,229
the reason I put this here is because I

194
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,330
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the organization's we</font>

195
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,219
go to they already have a tool in mind

196
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,580
right which and the tool is really based

197
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the vendor so the you know the person</font>

198
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,669
who's making the decisions looks at

199
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,889
their tool set their existing tool set

200
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,599
and they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already have all of</font>

201
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,190
these applications from this big vendor

202
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,349
all right and they'll give us a deal if

203
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,820
we get their tool so you go to that

204
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,830
vendor and you say hey I'm in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font>

205
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,659
for a new dynamic analysis tool or a new

206
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,430
static<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis tool or I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

207
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,539
help with my security program they come

208
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you and say oh we have the answer</font>

209
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:21,169
it's our tools big surprise right so

210
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,719
first you know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what is</font>

211
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,969
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best fit in your organization before</font>

212
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:28,759
going to the big vendors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and them</font>

213
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:31,789
selling their own tools to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

214
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">then once you have the an idea of what's</font>

215
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:35,479
compatible you think think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

216
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,610
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the tool how do you want</font>

217
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,140
to use the tool in your sdlc everyone's

218
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,079
else the ALCS are different and most of

219
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,550
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools can fit into multiple</font>

220
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:48,410
different points in your sdlc so you

221
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,729
know think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

222
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,660
buy a tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then try to stick it in</font>

223
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,579
there now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

224
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">more later so I have some some questions</font>

225
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,579
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go through the next</font>

226
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,600
couple slides kind of address these but

227
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,000
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions to help you</font>

228
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide which tools are compatible with</font>

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">your organization with your application</font>

230
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,779
portfolio so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is language</font>

231
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:06,800
support so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks really dark is this</font>

232
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,890
really dark for you

233
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,319
too sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if I if I can fix</font>

234
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing my minor sorry well</font>

235
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,360
this is showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handful of tool</font>

236
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,370
support for I asked right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is</font>

237
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,959
pretty new so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's not a</font>

238
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,029
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of support for it if you use</font>

239
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some pretty common languages if you use</font>

240
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,220
java.net PHP visual basic code fusing it

241
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,320
cold fusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and c-sharp those are the</font>

242
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,300
languages up here then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an is</font>

243
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution for you right either from</font>

244
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,709
contrast or from podium but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

245
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:41,420
use those languages or if the majority

246
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your applications are not one of</font>

247
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,920
those languages then I asked right now

248
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,269
is probably a little too new definitely

249
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,740
worth exploring in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future where you</font>

250
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,390
can reach out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the vendor and say hey</font>

251
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,579
is this on your road map I know both

252
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,620
both vendors are looking to add more

253
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:58,010
language support but as of right now

254
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,329
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of support for for</font>

255
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,560
more esoteric languages they'll say

256
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:05,449
frameworks are also this is a really

257
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting one if you for static</font>

258
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,220
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to any of the vendors</font>

259
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,160
websites they all say they support you

260
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,360
know all the major frameworks and if you

261
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,770
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sales people they say the</font>

262
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing but if you get your</font>

263
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">application when you scan it you may</font>

264
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,770
find that they support some of the

265
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,510
features of different frameworks and

266
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,279
we've run into this several times with

267
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,689
different customers who use frameworks

268
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,779
in different ways than the vendors

269
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,550
expected so we go and scan their

270
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,939
applications with a static analysis tool

271
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,469
and we get very confusing results right

272
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,620
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find things I have false</font>

273
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,140
positives they just break down and we go

274
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,020
to the vendor and we say hey what about

275
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,880
you know struts2 you say you support it

276
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,410
but it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting any</font>

277
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,230
data flow through any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the struts to</font>

278
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,480
code and they say oh well we didn't

279
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">think people would use it this way and</font>

280
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,250
so they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make enhancements so I</font>

281
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,320
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my point is you know I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

282
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,019
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're lying right they do</font>

283
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,790
support them but maybe only certain

284
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,890
features and you may or may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

285
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,980
those features so before you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

286
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,329
invest in a tool you know try to pilot

287
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,890
it on your applications try to get a

288
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:16,910
demo of it in the way that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use</font>

289
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:20,020
it confirm in some way that your

290
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,189
applications are actually covered

291
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,800
javascript is the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dynamic</font>

292
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:27,320
analysis right all the vendor said a

293
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,329
fully support javascript but a lot of

294
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,800
them don't they break down when trying

295
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to spite our applications that use</font>

296
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript for navigation they can't</font>

297
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:38,090
find down based XSS and these are things

298
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,310
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know are really important if</font>

299
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:43,190
your applications use<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript for for</font>

300
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:45,020
most of your navigation either the desk

301
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,520
tool might not work at all or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may</font>

302
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,470
need to spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time up front</font>

303
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,020
teaching the desk tool exactly how your

304
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,820
navigation works and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just may</font>

305
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">not expect that so something to consider</font>

306
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,300
different security controls right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

307
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,850
your applications all use their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

308
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,120
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls for authentication</font>

309
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,970
access control and everything else then

310
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,060
static analysis tools and interactive

311
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,700
analysis tools those those those tool

312
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,589
sets are really rule-based right they go

313
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,210
through all the code or through the

314
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,940
running application and they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

315
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,860
API is being invoked and they make a

316
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,140
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API they don't</font>

317
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,360
recognize that API they can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

318
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,920
really good decision right so if you use

319
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,250
certain applications for about or a

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,170
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> library for validation and that</font>

321
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:38,240
library isn't part of your vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule</font>

322
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">set well then you're then the tool is</font>

323
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,690
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's no validation</font>

324
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,770
happening when there actually is you're

325
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,690
gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write custom rules for</font>

326
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not a problem if you only have one</font>

327
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,600
or two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three applications but when</font>

328
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,099
you're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of your</font>

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,170
applications hundreds of applications

330
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,020
across your organization that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

331
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if you use common</font>

332
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,520
components if you say you have to use a

333
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,850
sappy this<font color="#E5E5E5"> method of a sappy when you're</font>

334
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,800
outputting coding into HTML becomes a

335
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,020
lot easier you write one rule and it

336
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,109
covers all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your applications or many</font>

337
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your applications but if you don't it</font>

338
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,020
can be a lot harder a lot more work up

339
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,260
front test case coverage is another one

340
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:23,930
for intrinsic analysis or sorry

341
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:28,069
interactive analysis so its interactive

342
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:30,079
analysis is very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on executing</font>

343
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,290
parts of the application right so if you

344
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,459
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute a particular</font>

345
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,769
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application same with</font>

346
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,560
dynamic analysis then the tool doesn't

347
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,480
know anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that application</font>

348
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,060
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from static analysis</font>

349
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,399
which just execute all the paths you can

350
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,689
find all right the dynamic and

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,920
interactive analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> only see can only</font>

352
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,480
find vulnerabilities in the code that's

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,089
actually executed so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

354
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">test cases a lot of times you're not</font>

355
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,529
going to find vulnerabilities in code

356
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,769
you know it's not covered<font color="#CCCCCC"> by those test</font>

357
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,089
cases so certain tools this isn't it as

358
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,589
much of an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

359
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,630
dynamic analysis tools drive themselves

360
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,040
kind of rightly spider and then they

361
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:12,360
look for vulnerabilities within those

362
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,329
spider pages but mostly or let me say

363
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,800
contrast in particular for interactive

364
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,750
analysis doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that it relies on</font>

365
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,370
you to have test cases to drive the

366
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,199
application and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks through</font>

367
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:28,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the parts of the application</font>

368
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:30,449
that you have covered sorry so false

369
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:33,569
positives and false negatives are

370
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:35,399
another one right if you guys have run

371
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:37,829
static analysis tools on your

372
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,160
applications I the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did it I</font>

373
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:42,930
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocked right you run a big vendor</font>

374
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,399
static analysis tool on an application

375
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred thousand lines of</font>

376
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,430
code and you get 10,000 findings back

377
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,959
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

378
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,239
right like most of these are false

379
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,529
positives and then there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

380
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,089
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not being found</font>

381
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:58,949
other other those are false negatives

382
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,019
right false positives or things that the

383
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:03,240
applicant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool says is an issue</font>

384
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,769
and actually isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> false negatives are</font>

385
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,630
things that the app that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool says</font>

386
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:08,220
are not issues right it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just doesn't</font>

387
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,889
point them out but they are actual

388
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,810
vulnerabilities so you need some way to

389
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,510
handle this and that's either going to

390
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:17,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a manual review and that's difficult</font>

391
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,260
because again your budgets are probably

392
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,719
not moving up very much and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

393
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,209
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources to go through all of</font>

394
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,019
these findings<font color="#E5E5E5"> manually or you need to</font>

395
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:29,430
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strict filters to say only</font>

396
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:32,040
show me we did this with a customer we

397
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,870
said all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want any false</font>

398
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,250
but they wanted no false positives they

399
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,259
also didn't want to write any custom

400
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,689
rules right so no no tool configuration

401
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:41,459
it up just out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box we want to use</font>

402
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">this tool and get all the best results</font>

403
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:45,170
we can so we deployed the tool

404
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,240
actually in a continuous integration

405
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,589
environment so we deployed it in

406
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,380
continuous integration environment I'll

407
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,940
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a little bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

408
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">scanned 20 applications just to test</font>

409
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,140
right and we applied the filters that we

410
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,360
wanted that they wanted right which were

411
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,699
only cross-site scripting only sequel

412
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,070
injection and only command injection or

413
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">OS objection and only if the tool was</font>

414
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,150
really confident that it was a real

415
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:10,130
vulnerability that's really really

416
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,110
limiting really strict filters so across

417
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 applications right if we had scanned</font>

418
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,050
these on their own we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got</font>

419
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,490
what 200 thousand findings right

420
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:23,510
applying these filters across 20

421
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,940
applications zero findings so what value

422
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,740
does that add right if you if you get

423
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,870
all these false positives and give them

424
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,550
to developers the developers are going

425
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,520
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adding any value at</font>

426
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,979
all to their to them right<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a security</font>

427
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,470
team but if you're also applying very

428
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,880
strict filters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developers get no</font>

429
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,320
findings then you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not adding value to</font>

430
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,060
anyone you might as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well not run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

431
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,800
tool so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

432
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,550
solution if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at static</font>

433

analysis some<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional considerations</font>

434
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,589
in general evaluating<font color="#CCCCCC"> third party</font>

435
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:59,690
libraries right so static analysis

436
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:02,180
usually doesn't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through libraries at</font>

437
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,699
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right some some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor solutions</font>

438
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,959
do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them don't they just get</font>

439
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,329
and they look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the method</font>

440
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,160
signature and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go through it</font>

441
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,319
and they use the mark up the rules that

442
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've created to say that this method</font>

443
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,869
signature you know is causing a boner

444
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,920
ability or snap right so it's important

445
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know if that's important to you that</font>

446
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to look at third party</font>

447
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,819
libraries vulnerable dependencies right

448
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:28,130
known<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdes some vendors will look at</font>

449
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,750
those right it will look at your entire

450
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,520
application the source code as well as

451
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,790
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the libraries you're using and say</font>

452
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,520
hey you have a using this library which

453
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,379
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years old and has these known</font>

454
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,610
vulnerabilities associated with it so

455
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,620
you should either change and use a

456
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:47,030
different library or at least upgrade to

457
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:49,280
a newer one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay SAS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus product so</font>

458
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:52,160
some vendors again you upload your code

459
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,870
to them they do their own work right

460
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,179
which has some benefits they scan the

461
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">application on their own were they</font>

462
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,379
you know reach out to your network and

463
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,850
scan you wrap your application running

464
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:03,860
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the benefits is that you you</font>

465
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,110
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> get very few or no false</font>

466
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,330
positives because they they review all

467
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings for you but you know there</font>

468
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,949
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some drawbacks to security as a</font>

469
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,019
service also versus the product where

470
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,700
you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-house but you have to do</font>

471
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:20,379
all the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you're in full control</font>

472
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:24,440
everything stays within your network so

473
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:26,840
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost obviously I prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

474
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,549
start with the free tools I think it's

475
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,799
in general a better option you can you

476
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:32,809
can usually build off of them most of

477
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,158
them are extensible at least so if they

478
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:38,178
don't have the features you want you can

479
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:40,100
add features and even still they're

480
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,249
great for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof of concepts and pilots</font>

481
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,899
of new automation programs and then

482
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:50,570
there's the sdlc integration points and

483
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:52,489
i have several slides about this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

484
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,259
that's a pool table right so would you

485
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,049
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see a sweet deal on a</font>

486
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,700
pool table right awesome pool table<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font>

487
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">bucks you're going to go and buy that</font>

488
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,970
pool table<font color="#CCCCCC"> and bring it home and see hey</font>

489
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,340
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my house can i put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this pool</font>

490
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,960
table yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be the 50 bucks</font>

491
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,369
but you know it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna end up</font>

492
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,289
in the backyard all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

493
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:13,039
room for a pool table unless I move my

494
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:14,480
couch out of my living room right so you

495
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,460
know you don't don't treat your tools

496
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,379
that way don't go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy a tool</font>

497
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,149
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then try to</font>

498
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">shove it in wherever you can fit it in</font>

499
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:24,619
your in your life cycle it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

500
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,749
to work out too well so the best place

501
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:29,509
for a tool really depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sdlc</font>

502
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:31,399
you're using again I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

503
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:34,249
so most tools have multiple integration

504
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:36,559
points and someone said yesterday they

505
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:38,149
use the term sprinkle security

506
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,139
throughout the sdlc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

507
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,689
so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say it all the time now</font>

508
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:43,309
sprinkle security throughout the sdlc I

509
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know a little bit everywhere</font>

510
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,990
instead of all at one point so if you're

511
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,369
using waterfall processes I get the

512
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,799
feeling that most people here are not

513
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,240
right there's a lot of DevOps talks and

514
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,399
everyone seems to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that so</font>

515
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,610
I'm guessing more people or agile but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

516
00:19:55,399 --> 00:20:00,408
you're using waterfall processes you

517
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,939
know you can stick tools still in

518
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,980
development you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could stick them in QA</font>

519
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,109
most people are just using them at

520
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,820
security testing you're using them as

521
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:09,149
gates to elevate to elevate your

522
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,099
applications into production

523
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:12,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright slows things down I mean it's a</font>

524
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:16,289
definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> water pull slows things</font>

525
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:18,119
down it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really adding a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

526
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,940
lot of value most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

527
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,589
we see doing this right they say your

528
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,509
application can't go to production until

529
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,979
we do a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> review and we look at</font>

530
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:28,379
the findings will give you the findings

531
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:29,820
if there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues you'll fix them then</font>

532
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:32,158
you'll come back and we'll move you to

533
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,749
production that never happens right the

534
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">development team says we're on a</font>

535
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,869
deadline we need to get this team in

536
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,549
production they get a risk-based

537
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,689
decision the application goes into

538
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,059
production with the vulnerabilities

539
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,099
anyway right so that's what's happening

540
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,239
so it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> that valuable but you</font>

541
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,820
can stick it in development you can

542
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:49,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">stick it in QA so in development most of</font>

543
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,749
these tools have ID plugins at least if

544
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using common IDEs like eclipse</font>

545
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:57,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">Visual Studio a lot of IDEs are</font>

546
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:02,099
eclipse-based even aside from eclipse so

547
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:04,199
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into that runtime agents in</font>

548
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,168
development right this is this is really

549
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,299
contrast so full disclosure contrast is

550
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:11,519
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spinoff from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a spec security right</font>

551
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,229
start at aspect and then moved and

552
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,809
started its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> its its own entity now</font>

553
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:18,179
so I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> biased I try not to show</font>

554
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:21,359
that biased but just in case you know

555
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:23,190
full disclosure so but you can have a

556
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,839
runtime agent where the development team

557
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,919
they're doing testing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

558
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,059
doing functional testing of their

559
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,249
application to make sure it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

560
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:32,719
it's a web app and they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> local web</font>

561
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:36,029
server on their computer they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

562
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:37,349
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool an agent sitting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

563
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,759
and watching all the requests and

564
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:40,849
responses and giving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

565
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,869
feedback in development at the same time

566
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,279
it's pretty valuable and then any

567
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,529
command line tools I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

568
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,759
you can just hit go from the command

569
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,580
line developers are pretty smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

570
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,469
like they can run command line stuff hit

571
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,658
go and you get some results as long as

572
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:56,999
there aren't a lot of false positives

573
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:59,879
it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can do that developers</font>

574
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:01,799
are typically pretty open to it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

575
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:03,689
false positive rate is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> important of</font>

577
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,359
don't don't give your developers false

578
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,690
positives because I'll lose confidence

579
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:11,218
in you immediately then in QA same thing

580
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,200
you can have a runtime agent this is the

581
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:15,509
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you take a runtime agent</font>

582
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,339
and you stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in QA you put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

583
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:19,349
server your develop your QA team is

584
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,599
testing and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting</font>

not doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

587
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,320
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same test they were</font>

00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing before but now you're getting</font>

589
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,669
security results it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if</font>

590
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you stick a browser plug-in or a proxy</font>

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you run zap you put zap on</font>

592
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,140
your QA testers machines or burp you put

593
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:39,450
it in passive mode so it's so it's

594
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,880
passively looking for issues you'll get

595
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,850
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-hanging fruit you know do</font>

596
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have the right cookie flag set and</font>

597
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,330
it'll even find some in some cases

598
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,100
cross-site scripting or sequel injection

599
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,980
or at least give you a lead and those

600
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">things can really save time later when</font>

601
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to the security testing because</font>

602
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,960
your security testers don't have to look

603
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,520
for those things all right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

604
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,720
found in QA or their factory where

605
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,750
they're very likely not there because

606
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,650
they were fixed in development so I like

607
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:10,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that I like to think that by</font>

608
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,120
moving security further up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and by</font>

609
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,890
automating things you allow your

610
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,229
security team at this space at the

611
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,820
security testing phase to really use

612
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,710
their brain power to really use their

613
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,990
security intelligence and not to just be

614
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,590
you know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> time does it take to</font>

615
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:27,480
unzip a huge amount of source code all

616
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,590
right I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a waste of time so</font>

617
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,280
there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are better ways to handle</font>

618
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,649
that so again I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that later so</font>

619
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,629
agile processes right same things you

620
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,429
development QA security testing it's all

621
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,440
the same then you have DevOps which is

622
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,330
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting there's lots of</font>

623
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,280
things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with dev ops and a lot</font>

624
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have talked about those so far</font>

625
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,490
so I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go too much into</font>

626
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,320
them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can also run any high</font>

627
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,880
confidence test that's pretty quick

628
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,580
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> command my tools anything like</font>

629
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,500
that and then you have continuous

630
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,500
integration<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right continuous</font>

631
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,929
integration is is awesome and this is

632
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,970
really this is really what I would hope

633
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,410
is becomes like securities

634
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">bread-and-butter moving forward there's</font>

635
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,740
no reason that continuous integration is

636
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,330
only used for development all right you

637
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,950
can do anything continuous any well not

638
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,689
anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a lot in continuous</font>

639
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,200
integration right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have run time</font>

640
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,150
agents I mean so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I'd</font>

641
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,950
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see from a security testing</font>

642
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of view right developer commits</font>

643
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:26,340
code continuous integration server

644
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,950
senses that builds the code runs static

645
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,659
analysis on it right execute whatever

646
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,120
static analysis tools you have it's

647
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,059
probably you're probably using PMD and

648
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,418
other code quality tools now so you can

649
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,759
write

650
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,340
any tools for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those but you can also add</font>

651
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,320
hooks most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big-name commercial</font>

652
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,509
tools have command-line interfaces also

653
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,009
or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them even have automation</font>

654
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,789
interfaces that are you know totally

655
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:49,289
different but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command-line</font>

656
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,809
interfaces are pretty powerful already

657
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:53,249
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could probably run most of you</font>

658
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,220
are static analysis commercial static

659
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:57,840
analysis tools in continuous integration

660
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,980
and we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for different</font>

661
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,779
customers it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> out very well so you</font>

662
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,249
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the static analysis results so then</font>

663
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:09,480
the application is built and BM started

664
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:12,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">up this is where your dev ops team comes</font>

665
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,559
in your dev ops team can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

666
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,840
manage the deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this new build</font>

667
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,779
to a testing server right you spin up a

668
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,980
BM use puppet or chef or whatever you

669
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:29,309
want spin up this VM take your newly

670
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,249
built web app push it over to the vm

671
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:35,399
into a running web web container web

672
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:37,289
server on the BM and then you use

673
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,998
selenium where your dynamic analysis

674
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:43,109
tools get executed via scripts all

675
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:45,149
happens automatically to dynamically

676
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,678
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> your application so where you run</font>

677
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:47,969
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it doesn't matter you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do any</font>

678
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">test you want but now you have your</font>

679
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,259
application actually spun up in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> VM</font>

680
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,179
and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tests</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you copy the</font>

681
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,429
results out and you send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

682
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,749
reporting console or you store the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

683
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,309
and a shared<font color="#CCCCCC"> driver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do whatever you</font>

684
00:25:57,749 --> 00:26:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do with them and then you</font>

685
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,668
destroy the BM the next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

686
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,168
from scratch to do the same thing right

687
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,940
that's what DevOps specializes in is

688
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:08,159
doing this type of thing for production

689
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,690
they can eat just as well do it in

690
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:16,529
continuous integration environments for

691
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:18,269
testing oh and then all those results

692
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,470
from continuous integration sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

693
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,609
fed back to development right so

694
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,859
anything you find continuous integration

695
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:24,480
is during your build process<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

696
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,559
your development cycles so you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

697
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,659
back to development and all that stuff

698
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets fixed right away instead of waiting</font>

699
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:31,859
until you know down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the line when you</font>

700
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,179
get to security testing so how do you

701
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:34,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">know where to integrate what do you make</font>

702
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,450
it how do you make that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision well if</font>

703
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,369
you're using continuous integration if

704
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,529
you're doing continuous delivery really

705
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend you start there you know</font>

706
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,279
there's there's some upfront work but

707
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,039
it's it's well worth it because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

708
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,599
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fast and all the time</font>

709
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,260
you get them regularly you can set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

710
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,300
do it on every

711
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,560
it you can set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to do it on any</font>

712
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,940
schedule we want every day every week

713
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,860
every month every quarter your

714
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,090
developers have time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run scans most</font>

715
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,219
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've worked with they</font>

716
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,110
don't write developers want to be

717
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,530
developing so having static analysis

718
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,689
tools on their laptops usually doesn't

719
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">work out because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes a while but</font>

720
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,950
some developers get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really jazzed up</font>

721
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,409
about this the ones who are also into

722
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,510
security love to run static<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis on</font>

723
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,340
their own laptops so this kind of a case

724
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,900
by case basis you have to evaluate your

725
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,320
developers to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fit</font>

726
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,120
or not but in some cases it is you have

727
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,439
a QA team because if you do your QA<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

728
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,870
should be doing security testing too

729
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,060
they don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about it right</font>

730
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,560
you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it transparent to them but it</font>

731
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,179
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening because it's earlier</font>

732
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,879
in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get those results you</font>

733
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,710
can make changes and then integrate a

734
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,650
test like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already doing but try</font>

735
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,480
to simplify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow a little bit</font>

736
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll talk which about some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

737
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,390
that in a few slides so integrate with

738
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,520
your existing tools if you're using this

739
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,590
is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is Jenkins or this is part of</font>

740
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,800
Jenkins we had a customer who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using</font>

741
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,840
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gant source is IBM apps can source</font>

742
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,669
and so for continuous integration we

743
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,129
wanted to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy it has a</font>

744
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">command-line tool right you can execute</font>

745
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,680
it all from the command line but if you

746
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,570
do that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a bunch of</font>

747
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,830
batch scripts or<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerShell scripts or</font>

748
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,090
shell scripts depending on what you're

749
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:18,570
using it's a lot to maintain its really

750
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,909
fragile so and we wanted we wanted that

751
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,439
their security team<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

752
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,910
this and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want them to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

753
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,710
have the prerequisite of knowing all

754
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,270
these scripting languages so we build

755
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin for Jenkins because it's</font>

756
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,250
extensible like like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools these</font>

757
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,840
days built or at least open source tools

758
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,870
are pretty extensible so we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

759
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">plugin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for Jenkins with a pretty front</font>

760
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,610
end where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do anything</font>

761
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just get in in your application you</font>

762
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:46,290
add this as a build step you had the

763
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:49,470
apps can build step you stick in your

764
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,470
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses for notifications and</font>

765
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,600
that's it if you and you put the files

766
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,430
generated by apps can in the directories

767
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,830
there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a common</font>

768
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,260
directory path structure

769
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,539
right and that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then when they</font>

770
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,309
kick when they hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next build apps</font>

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can do whatever you want with that</font>

774
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,570

778
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,779
point is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the tools you</font>

779
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,130
already have because they're pretty

780
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:24,929
powerful and most of them are expensive

781
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,429
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> regardless of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you integrate</font>

782
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,169
provide security feedback as early as

783
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:30,600
possible sure most of you have seen this

784
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:33,779
chart<font color="#E5E5E5"> or charge very similar to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

cost to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix an issue is way cheaper if</font>

786
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:38,220
you do it while developers are still

787
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:42,179
developing then if you do it during

788
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,500
production or any other phase automate

789
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,870
as much as possible it'll save you a lot

790
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,610
of time it'll save you a lot of energy

791
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,668
and it will let people who get into

792
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:53,010
challenging jobs like security do that

793
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:56,039
security work instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more mundane</font>

794
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,240
redundant tasks and the more transparent

795
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,039
the process the more likely it'll be

796
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,690
accepted right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

797
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,639
in and say we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these new</font>

798
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,809
processes we want to do that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

799
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,309
make security way better you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

800
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:07,220
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of pushback because people</font>

801
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,029
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same jobs for 5 10</font>

802
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,120
20 years right they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

803
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:16,289
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it's difficult so process</font>

804
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,299
efficiency real quick this is kind of

805
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:19,919
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about where if you if</font>

806
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:22,260
you so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use continuous</font>

807
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,159
integration now or if you do but you

808
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,049
kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay out of the</font>

809
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,630
developer space this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was what we did</font>

810
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:30,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">with one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers where they had</font>

811
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,039
each application is basically on its own

812
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right the applications don't talk</font>

813
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,860
together they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different build</font>

814
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,010
servers they have different source code

815
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:42,330
repositories so what we did was we<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

816
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:45,000
up a CI server a Jenkins<font color="#E5E5E5"> server for the</font>

817
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:46,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">security team and then we said we need</font>

818
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your developer</font>

819
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:50,879
source code repositories and that was a

820
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:52,709
big undertaking that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy</font>

821
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,350
in a large organization especially if

822
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:58,769
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

823
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,840
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and permission systems and</font>

824
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:02,519
things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did it took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

825
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">while but we did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does</font>

826
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is so first of all now you can add all</font>

827
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,090
those security tests on the security

828
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,020
team CI server right you can test

829
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you want because you have</font>

830
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,440
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the source code you have</font>

831
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to all their dependency</font>

832
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,520
so when I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about extracting</font>

833
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">those zip files what I mean is you know</font>

834
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,350
as a security consultant when we go to a

835
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,659
company that wants us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a review a</font>

836
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,820
source code review they'll usually send

837
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,700
us a zip file or an ear file or whatever

838
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,429
with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their code and some of their</font>

839
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,470
dependencies which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can't</font>

840
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">build their application and that's fine</font>

841
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,740
we were used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because that's how</font>

842
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,810
the industry has been working for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long</font>

843
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,600
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could</font>

844
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:43,100
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do other things with it</font>

845
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,490
we know if you if you get it to compile

846
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,199
within eclipse you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get all sorts</font>

847
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,910
of nice ways to navigate through the

848
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,940
code otherwise you end up just searching

849
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,340
through files manually but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

850
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,990
CI server right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to</font>

851
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,730
their source code directly we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font>

852
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,200
build suddenly we have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

853
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,820
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> code in all their dependencies we</font>

854
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,620
have everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the developers have</font>

855
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,360
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases you'll also get their</font>

856
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,370
build scripts and who knows what else

857
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,840
documentation that you wouldn't have

858
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,899
otherwise because developers store that

859
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,050
stuff in there in their code

860
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:17,210
repositories so this was a nice solution

861
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:20,510
when if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a pretty decentralized</font>

862
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:22,910
group of development teams and it really

863
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,470
improved the security teams so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when the</font>

864
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,770
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> team then in this case needs to</font>

865
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,880
do a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> review they just hit build</font>

866
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,050
they have all the source code make it

867
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,980
start right from there instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of they</font>

868
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:34,639
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to reach out to the</font>

869
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:37,960
development teams right unless less back

870
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,150
and forth makes everyone happier

871
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,550
simplify your workflows so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again</font>

872
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:47,210
this is static analysis or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example at</font>

873
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:49,040
least applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to static analysis this</font>

874
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,770
is actually at that same organization

875
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,330
where their security teams were doing

876
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,740
kind of one-off security reviews and

877
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,169
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right one of</font>

878
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,970
security reviews they would get the

879
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,350
source code and scan it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with with this</font>

880
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,330
particular tool with applicants<font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font>

881
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,270
said it earlier so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they scan the tool</font>

882
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,030
with apps can source and then send the

883
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,720
send the results to developers and then

884
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:14,090
they were done right but what we said is

885
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,580
take take the results you have right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

886
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of instead of just sending the</font>

887
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,760
results of going through one at a time

888
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,010
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool as its intended</font>

889
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,410
right apps can source allows you to

890
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,940
bundle findings fortify allows you to

891
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,360
bucket findings it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

892
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,100
right

893
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,320
grouping findings you put them into

894
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,050
these groups and you put that grouping

895
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,639
in a central location the next time you

896
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,649
or someone else goes to review the

897
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,860
application they can grab those groups

898
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,660
and it will show them which findings

899
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,159
you've already looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at right so year</font>

900
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,020
one you look at all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> findings</font>

901
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,700
you're too you only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at new</font>

902
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,410
findings because all the findings<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

903
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,760
you looked at last year haven't changed

904
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,620
at all right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know whether</font>

905
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,570
they're there these are false positives

906
00:33:51,620 --> 00:34:00,350
right you have 10,000 findings you look

907
00:33:53,570 --> 00:34:03,230
at 10,000 of them presumably and 9996 of

908
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,969
them are false positives<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have</font>

909
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">four real vulnerabilities the next year</font>

910
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,630
you look do I have these for

911
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,370
vulnerabilities yes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> no and then</font>

912
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,320
what's new what what and the code has

913
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed right you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

914
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,940
those all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9000 again so general</font>

915
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,440
recommendations if if is is available if

916
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,720
it's good fit for you definitely

917
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,400
recommend using it it's it's a pretty

918
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,929
advanced that's pretty cool technology

919
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,950
and it's worthwhile if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

920
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,169
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know keep it on your radar</font>

921
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:35,089
because it's it's pretty good if

922
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible though it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a silver bullet</font>

923
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:39,470
so definitely use at least two two

924
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,060
technologies right so biased isn't

925
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:43,779
available you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be doing sets and</font>

926
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,739
dest and if it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'd you know</font>

927
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,400
figure out what else is a good fit I

928
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:49,370
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

929
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,690
recommendations in general even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

930
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:55,819
this is called general recommendations

931
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:57,590
but but you use at least two and when

932
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,360
you do don't create silos and your

933
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,220
security teams so we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot we</font>

934
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,410
go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a SAS team and a</font>

935
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,819
desk team and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams don't talk right</font>

936
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,470
they use different they<font color="#E5E5E5"> use different</font>

937
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,910
installations I use different versions

938
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,319
of the software all right in these

939
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,700
vendors if you buy a tool from these

940
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,260
vendors if you buy a set and dashed

941
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,879
offering they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually come with a</font>

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:19,430
reporting web content website whatever

943
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know for that comes with SSC apps</font>

944
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">can source comes with AppScan enterprise</font>

945
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,109
that's where all the findings<font color="#CCCCCC"> from both</font>

946
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,170
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can go to one place and</font>

947
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">look and see all of your findings right</font>

948
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,350
but these most organizations aren't

949
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,360
doing it like that they have their SAS

950
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,799
team that has an installation of this

951
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,940
reporting console and a desk team that

952
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,500
has an installation of this reporting

953
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,270
console they don't talk their

954
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,570
vulnerabilities overlap developers get

955
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,300
to reports every

956
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,890
there's a you know a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> or they</font>

957
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,510
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SAS report they get a desk report</font>

958
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,529
instead of just one report that says

959
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,870
these are the vulnerability is

960
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,020
correlated blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know</font>

961
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,130
have your team's talk it's worthwhile if

962
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,130
you're if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

963
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,830
prototype pilot there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free</font>

964
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,440
tools out there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and</font>

965
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,420
burp they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good for to start</font>

966
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,450
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> guest I really like sonar cube is</font>

967
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,250
great both as a reporting console if you

968
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,569
haven't used it it's worthwhile it's

969
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,650
really a code quality tool but you can

970
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:15,510
do security stuff also used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called</font>

971
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,950
sonar and they rebranded to sonar cube

972
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,380
which makes school going<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them a lot</font>

973
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,870
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then sprinkle security</font>

974
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,400
through your sdlc I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that definitely</font>

975
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">worthwhile don't don't just stick it in</font>

976
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,380
one place and then get continuous which

977
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,930
is a slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I removed but it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

978
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,370
a continuous application security which

979
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,680
jeff williams talks about all the time

980
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:38,279
right it'd be really nice if instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

981
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,960
having one off reports that say you know

982
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,270
right now my security looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

983
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a continuous dashboard that</font>

984
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,830
shows you right now not not three months

985
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,780
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did those security reviews</font>

986
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,250
but right now this is what my security

987
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,770
posture looks like and that's possible

988
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you you know use use a bunch of these</font>

989
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools you automate them to call us</font>

990
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,230
sensors it's a whole different talk but

991
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,450
it's worth looking into continuous

992
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,130
application security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy to</font>

993
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,810

like and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my last slide so i'm</font>

995
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,380
wrapping up if you're still not sure

996
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,060
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do just come talk to me</font>

997
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,550
I'd be happy to talk to you email<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

998

<font color="#E5E5E5">contact me in some way I'd love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

999

<font color="#E5E5E5">about this stuff and you're not alone</font>

1000
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,350
everyone's using these tools and

1001
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's having trouble with them</font>

00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,360
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there very large complicated</font>

1003
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,360
expensive tools they're not designed for

1004
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,980
people who even go to one I mean you can

1005
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a week-long training and come out</font>

1006
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then when you go to run the tools in</font>

1007
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,810
your organization you still have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1008
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font>

1009
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:35,640
common so you're not alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a real</font>

1010
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,980
problem and hopefully through automation

1011
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,509
will make it a little easier so if you

1012
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,180
have questions or positive feedback I'm

1013
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:45,350
open to it if it's negative feedback

1014
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,350
maybe email<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but</font>

1015
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:54,470
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with the ladies always</font>

1016
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool to see whether they're 20</font>

1017
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:01,160
have a plot in doing the proper findings

1018
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:05,169
by crazy

1019
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,170
position and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought was</font>

1020
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,470
and she validated

1021
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,100
has all these vulnerabilities

1022
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,640
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having a slide in</font>

1023
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:33,040
here that kind of had a high level

1024
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,500
summary of how well sash<font color="#E5E5E5"> deaths and I</font>

1025
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,360
asked in general work with different

1026
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,010
vulnerabilities specifically across the

1027
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,900
OS top 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have it in here as</font>

1028
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,730
an appendix lied I left<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out because i</font>

1029
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,440
don't i don't know if it's a hundred

1030
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,970
percent it's mostly anecdotal actually

1031
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,640
was writing on the bottom so let me get

1032
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,589
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mostly anecdotal which is my</font>

1033
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:57,009
problem so i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have a lot of</font>

1034
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:59,230
actual data across the tools but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want</font>

1035
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,090
to it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build</font>

1036
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,400
right now but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a good</font>

1037
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,960
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> right along those same lines if you</font>

1038
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,580
if you have certain vulnerability types

1039
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,780
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find right</font>

1040
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain ones that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important</font>

1041
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you then it's it's definitely worth</font>

1042
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,240
while to build a test suite and test the

1043
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,310
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to run on the test</font>

1044
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,540
suite right before you buy them so in

1045
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,430
our a great example you don't have to do

1046
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that that's actually testing</font>

1047
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:24,850
your tests if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write sonar rules</font>

1048
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,919
right and that's a good thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

1049
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:32,350
the answer is no but hopefully yes the

1050
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,830
next time you see me yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you any</font>

1051
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,830
other questions

1052
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,530
No

1053
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,160
well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all very much really</font>

1054
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate coming</font>
