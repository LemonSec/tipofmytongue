1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,320
so objectives for my talk on two things

2
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,800
getting an overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's going on</font>

3
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,570
in the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two factor</font>

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,950
authentication solutions what kind of

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,080
solutions are out there that actually

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,420
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been commercialized or maybe are</font>

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,760
available as open source but that you

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:42,780
can go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> get use go and use and look</font>

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,910
at those solutions from a sort of risk

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,379
flat modeling perspective what kind of

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,199
problem are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we to actually trying to</font>

12
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve in our particular infrastructure</font>

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:58,570
on and are these solutions going to help

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,489
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so the agenda when i first</font>

15
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">started thinking about this talk and was</font>

16
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,940
like oh yes that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do</font>

17
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:10,330
matrixes of spreadsheets with katia and

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,240
products into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tick marks and I so</font>

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:15,610
actually got closer due to coming up

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">with these slides or seguro actually</font>

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,630
this is going to be totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring and</font>

22
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,979
not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful so what we're going to</font>

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,800
do is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

24
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,390
about motivation so other education in

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,149
general what what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues for</font>

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,000
passwords and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,320
at solutions and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them</font>

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,750
as examples for different questions that

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,490
I think mostly from a securely focus you

30
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,820
want to ask yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you go and</font>

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:46,770
implement whatever solution you<font color="#CCCCCC"> settle</font>

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:49,809
on in your infrastructure um and maybe

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:55,600
there's some snake<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil maybe not we'll</font>

34
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:58,960
see so introduction authentication

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">factors I think pretty much all of you</font>

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">are probably aware that traditionally</font>

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,739
wristed we distinguish between different

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,640
factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> s either something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so</font>

39
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:15,760
typically passwords or pins or something

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,730
token-based something we we have we own

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,069
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical key that fits a lock all</font>

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:25,149
these days you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security tokens and</font>

43
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:28,140
what have you and biometrics so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:33,120
properties of a human like fingerprints

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I always patterns or maybe the way you</font>

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,900
type on your keyboard is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:43,290
being used in solutions there's a fault

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,500
integrally that is being referred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

49
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,679
authentication these days a lot in

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,050
products which is called risk-based

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,500
authentication where we go and basically

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:58,800
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the behavioral pattern and</font>

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context of a user session so</font>

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,530
things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know well typically</font>

55
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,489
David logs into his banking application

56
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">for my piece that are associated with</font>

57
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:13,380
the United States summer he's traveling

58
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,970
like Texas California whatever but all

59
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,250
of a sudden you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an</font>

60
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,470
authentication request coming from I

61
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:26,100
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah Asia so maybe that's a</font>

62
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,920
that's an indication that we have an

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,230
unauthorized legrest them maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

64
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:37,529
you try to do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of analysis</font>

65
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:40,500
um then so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still use passwords</font>

66
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,920
I like this quote I found in a in a

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,930
paper that's maybe two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or so old</font>

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,149
the continued termination of passwords

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,340
over all other methods of<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user</font>

70
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,239
authentication is a major embarrassment

71
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,510
to security researchers I thought well

72
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's sort of filling passwords they are</font>

73
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,399
the blue creatures everybody uses them

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,328
um everybody's used to using them

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,290
they're cheap to implement on you know

76
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,920
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have been doing but they</font>

77
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,900
have some issues so as security

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,599
professionals we worry about you know

79
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,239
passwords being stolen either on the

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,979
server side like a whole database of

81
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:28,679
passwords and user IDs but also by

82
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:31,289
potentially malware on users laptops and

83
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,190
PCs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their keyboard loggers or</font>

84
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:38,460
something more advanced replay attacks

85
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,469
um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good passwords</font>

86
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,620
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can guess them all those kind of</font>

87
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font>

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,330
especially with the assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

89
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,669
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people make in information</font>

90
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,479
security management in the enterprise's

91
00:04:50,669 --> 00:05:00,900
these days that end points laptop

92
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:03,840
species smart whatever phones cannot be

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,780
effectively and efficiently secured

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,810
against metal and exploitation so we

95
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,258
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume that you know adversaries</font>

96
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:17,699
are able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to users passwords by</font>

97
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,590
exploiting individual machines um so

98
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,539
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the issues with the the</font>

99
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,830
existing alternatives so when we talk

100
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:28,590
memory-based you know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

101
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,750
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with patterns or maybe on your</font>

102
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">android smartphone you login by swiping</font>

103
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,250
your finger and specific patterns over

104
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:39,689
the screen so something you can remember

105
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,500
they all have essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same issue</font>

106
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:46,050
as passwords on biometrics of their own

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:51,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues there's the whole topic of</font>

108
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:55,319
privacy and using your you know personal

109
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,349
identification marks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> other education</font>

110
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,229
some people say well really it's more

111
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:06,810
identification and not authentication

112
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:08,669
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to work a lot of</font>

113
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,490
solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> are easy to circumvent if</font>

114
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,889
there isn't a human standing next to the

115
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,080
biometric<font color="#CCCCCC"> leader making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you</font>

116
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,210
don't cheat it so you know iPhone

117
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,258
fingerprint sensor being an example was

118
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:27,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the day that they got the the iphone</font>

119
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:31,529
out that had it our tokens so how tokens

120
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:34,080
soft token smart tokens traditionally

121
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:37,800
expensive because we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a lot</font>

122
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,060
of hard tokens are difficult to replace

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:46,560
you know difficult for users to manage

124
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,150
can be stolen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready theft I can see</font>

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your wallet from your</font>

126
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,640
we've case rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

127
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:57,180
extracting a password out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your mind</font>

128
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:00,140
contexts they<font color="#CCCCCC"> help a lot in the</font>

129
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,820
risk-based evaluation of sessions but

130
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,099
you can't really authenticate you can't

131
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,400
prove an identity just<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on contacts</font>

132
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:13,050
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion so not not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really a valid</font>

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,299
authentication factor by itself so

134
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,690
current industry trends what are we

135
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing to mitigate the issues we have the</font>

136
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:29,100
passwords we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are tokens which are you</font>

137
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:31,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to compromise can be stolen</font>

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,510
though and combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with passwords</font>

139
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:39,570
which are easy to compromise and steal

140
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:43,280
um but physically that you can just

141
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:46,230
extract them without you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font>

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,960
noticing what's going on obviously

143
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,700
there's other factor solutions in the

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,190
running that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

145
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,599
biometrics context-based we talked about

146
00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:00,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to remind you of</font>

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,210
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll come</font>

148
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,640
back to that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end user</font>

149
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,580
identification and all the education is

150
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">really just a piece of the big puzzle of</font>

151
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,760
managing communities of users and

152
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,729
identities in particular in

153
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,390
organizational infrastructure managing

154
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:23,220
access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> and type demands so</font>

155
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,599
whatever solution you're looking at you

156
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,060
probably want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep in mind that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

157
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,030
needs to work with whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on</font>

158
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,039
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for organization all those</font>

159
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:37,020
good stuff so what we're going to do

160
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,730
next is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at examples</font>

161
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,929
of solutions and we're going to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

162
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,800
little bit about what we're actually

163
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:50,089
trying to protect and how and what the

164
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,770
threads are so typical you know

165
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,780
obviously this there might be difference

166
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,470
in protecting I hundreds of thousands of

167
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,890
accounts for like individual consumers

168
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:05,730
access a banking solution versus I have

169
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:08,430
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousands of you</font>

170
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,830
know corporate accounts different data

171
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:14,339
that is accumulated within the company

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,620
than an individual user accounts etc all

173
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:21,120
those thoughts basically going back to

174
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:26,130
typical risk assessment approaches and

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,620
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks one thing I want</font>

176
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,120
to point out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I in my slides I have a lot</font>

177
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,580
of screenshots basically examples I

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked around in the web below it what</font>

179
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,540
is out there what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people selling so</font>

180
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,000
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of examples of actual</font>

181
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,880
commercial products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and source products</font>

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">um by putting them on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

183
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,740
using them as examples I'm not endorsing

184
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,780
anything in particular or discrediting

185
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,950
anything in particular we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

186
00:09:51,780 --> 00:10:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at examples so let's start</font>

187
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:04,170
thinking about criteria for multi-factor

188
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,000
authentication solutions I think the

189
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">first question we need to ask is are</font>

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,450
there actually more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one factor in</font>

191
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,810
the solution so in my opinion a password

192
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a pin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> match together to two separate</font>

193
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,489
secrets and then I enter them on the

194
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,620
screen it still just one factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

195
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,320
knowledge-based authentication there's

196
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,600
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be gained unless you are in a</font>

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,310
dual control situation where different

198
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,720
people no different parts of the

199
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,069
password but other than that's not a

200
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,890
multi-factor not a two-factor

201
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:42,420
authentication how about passwords and

202
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,720
private keys crypto putting a

203
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,939
certificate on my laptop doing

204
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,420
certificate based authentication for a

205
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,040
while that was some being used well

206
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,339
never really frequently but you still

207
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,740
see it around that certain websites for

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,130
TLS ssl expect the user to have a

209
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,130
certificate that was issued to the user

210
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,130
initially

211
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:11,579
is that two factors combined for the

212
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">password maybe yes I know depends on I</font>

213
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:15,810
think what what problem we're trying to

214
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:19,500
solve if we are assuming that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

215
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,660
endpoint is compromised then an episode

216
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,410
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both to the password by</font>

217
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:28,019
observing<font color="#E5E5E5"> keystrokes and to the the</font>

218
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,139
certificate and private key by you know

219
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:33,209
accessing it on the endpoint so in that

220
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation probably is not going to help</font>

221
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:39,779
us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other situations it might actually</font>

222
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:41,220
increase your you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mitigation</font>

223
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:46,800
of whatever whiskey trying to mitigate

224
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:49,079
so things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about who of you is</font>

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,269
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> MailChimp it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a mass</font>

226
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,689
emailing solution we use it for our

227
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">localizes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H aptitude for our newsletter</font>

228
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,839
those guys actually put<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a free</font>

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,760
solution that they call alter ego and

230
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,839
they themselves refer to it as one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

231
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,959
half factor authentication it works well

232
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,870
if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a smartphone it</font>

233
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,760
generates some basically time-based

234
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,829
one-time passwords or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

235
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:22,470
valid for 30 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> one minute and then</font>

236
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:24,149
you log in you use your laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log</font>

237
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">in with your password and then at the</font>

238
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:29,329
second factor from your smartphone they

239
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,529
call it one and a half factors because

240
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,029
there's a back door to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

241
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,180
intentionally there that you can go and

242
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually log</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the alter ego protal</font>

243
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,029
on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc in that way you know you do</font>

244
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,040
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your pc again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if your</font>

245
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">PC is compromised then doesn't solve</font>

246
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,980
anything so works in some situations not

247
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,990
so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> in others a cool thing they do</font>

248
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,290
is actually for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the commercial accounts</font>

249
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,449
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use their free one and a half</font>

250
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:00,240
factor authentication solution they give

251
00:12:57,449 --> 00:13:02,099
you discount on their services um so I

252
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,949
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just um</font>

253
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:10,709
thing so something else other example a

254
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,930
company called swivel and the solution

255
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:16,529
called pin safe they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a</font>

256
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,019
patent on that basically what they do is

257
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:23,130
it's a human computed challenge response

258
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:25,560
protocol so the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a pin four</font>

259
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,339
digit pin in their mind let's say it's

260
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,540
247 80 and then every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

261
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,069
log on the system sends you a challenge

262
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this random number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here when we</font>

263
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:43,170
generated and then in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> brain you are</font>

264
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:48,990
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2478 so the response to this</font>

265
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge is 714 three and that way what</font>

266
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you type on your keyboard every time is</font>

267
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,569
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different every time but then</font>

268
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">again if you just display this little</font>

269
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,939
graphic in your web browser and you

270
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,970
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your endpoint is compromised</font>

271
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,389
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help if an attacker can</font>

272
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,860
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these challenges and</font>

273
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,839
your response to they compute can

274
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,839
compute what your penis and and use it

275
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:22,800
so I I maintain that that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

276
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,930
situation again if you use different

277
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,639
channels for the different factors it

278
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,859
might help a bit but passwords and pins

279
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,610
regardless of which protocol you use to

280
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,600
transport them are not different factors

281
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,600
of course that's an opinion

282
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:46,449
so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more about</font>

283
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">communication channels and you know</font>

284
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,620
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear oh it's out-of-band</font>

285
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,099
authentication what does that actually

286
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:57,220
mean and what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gain us what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

287
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:06,700
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I hope you like my little</font>

288
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:10,450
drawing we have a user here and here's a

289
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">PC and really what he wants to go and do</font>

290
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:18,940
is go to this website by fresh fish and

291
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:22,540
buy fish and obviously the the password

292
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,760

293
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,930
the credential that's assume for now

294
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:32,830
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a time-based</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nino 30-second</font>

295
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,900
valid one time password<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate based</font>

296
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,260
on some cryptographic<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequence so</font>

297
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:43,300
there's an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> see or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totp that</font>

298
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:46,810
defines how to do that and the the

299
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,609
differently colored arrows here are

300
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,939
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> different information flows</font>

301
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:57,640
are scenarios that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> call talk</font>

302
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:59,860
little in terms of how does the second

303
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,800
factor this one time password actually

304
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,650
travel through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to the</font>

305
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,359
server that the user wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to so</font>

306
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:12,819
um a couple of thoughts here um there's

307
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,830
obviously this is a horse so there's a

308
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:20,290
Trojan horse on this computer so user

309
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,720
enters his credentials including the the

310
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,089
one time factor and then the children

311
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,240
house is like oh I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and he</font>

312
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:32,650
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to an adversary in the internet</font>

313
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,890
and this adversary um has 30 seconds or

314
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,470
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds now where that token</font>

315
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,750
that the the user entered is still valid

316
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the at masala can use that to</font>

317
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:48,000
establish a a valid session with the

318
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,390
user's account here impersonate the user

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,900
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be all their needs</font>

320
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:59,120
I'm different<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario let's let's</font>

321
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:02,150
assume the user uses the pc for the

322
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,579
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> but since the credential</font>

323
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:10,790
through the cell phone network so he

324
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:12,950
uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smartphone but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately he</font>

325
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,859
clicked on a link in his email that said

326
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh fresh fish on sale the ten percent</font>

327
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:20,540
off this weekend and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just clicked on</font>

328
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,810
that and didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that the URL for</font>

329
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the website was by fresh fish and buy</font>

330
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:31,639
fresh fish on so a phishing website set

331
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,740
up by our adversary that emulates the

332
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,760
original website looks the same more or

333
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,040
less user and justice credentials it

334
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,770
regardless of the way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

335
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,870
credentials travel the episode<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up</font>

336
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:51,379
with them again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can use them to</font>

337
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:56,689
establish a valid session and again in

338
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">some situations that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might work for us</font>

339
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,990
and that might be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution for us</font>

340
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in others we might be worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

341
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,660
this the third one here is an

342
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:10,100
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that you see in a couple</font>

343
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">of particularly in smartphone based</font>

344
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,850
solutions which is that the user

345
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,560
authenticates with his username and

346
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,770
password at the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

347
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:26,629
service since the push notification to

348
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,340
the smartphone um and says hey are you

349
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,680
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to log on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

350
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,100
server and the user can say yes but we

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:41,060
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say no and I'm traveling I</font>

352
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:43,280
know what's going on but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way um you</font>

353
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,129
know you have an out-of-band so you have

354
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:50,060
the original band here that the user and

355
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:53,470
password now on travel and you have a an

356
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:56,629
out-of-band confirmation of that session

357
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,900
established through a separate

358
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:04,390
communication channel that an atmosphere

359
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,390
has no easy way to intercept

360
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:17,340
who can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations where that</font>

361
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:22,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work exactly yeah so either they</font>

362
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:25,590
have your smartphone or the user tries

363
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:29,580
to log in<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the buy fresh fish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font>

364
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:31,560
from his smartphone and so it all goes

365
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,350
back to one channel and if the

366
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,280
smartphone is compromised which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

367
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,600
it's not an unrealistic assumption the

368
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:44,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">NY maybe everyone else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

369
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">better about it but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if all the</font>

370
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,910
authentication traffic originates from

371
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphone itself we are back to the</font>

372
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,210
question whether do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

373
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,090
whether the smartphone is compromised or

374
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,270
not because if it is then any episode we

375
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get any other education credentials</font>

376
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:10,550
that are based on the smartphone that

377
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:13,379
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense any questions cool</font>

378
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,450
so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about communication</font>

379
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:22,080
channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to give you some examples</font>

380
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:24,720
here there's a solution called duo that

381
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,139
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what I just described</font>

382
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,080
as the last two now you're there they

383
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,790
said you push notification saying hey

384
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,860
are you really in austin right now and

385
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,920
did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this or</font>

386
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,290
that service and you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes i know</font>

387
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,560
it's another service called twofer that

388
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,389
does something similar actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> UT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

389
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:53,340
think just started<font color="#E5E5E5"> using them for some</font>

390
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:55,410
student facing applications and so their

391
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,909
solutions out there that do that one

392
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,440
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

393
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,410
implement a solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

394
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,780
point out as well as on the

395
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:07,560
administrative side on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backhand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

396
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:11,490
the server side if a solution offers

397
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,129
multiple options so for example this 24

398
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,170
solution has a backup if you are offline

399
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,360
and they can send you a push

400
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:22,020
notification you can generate a

401
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,928
traditional one time password based on

402
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:30,360
on totp based on a a cryptographic<font color="#E5E5E5"> ste</font>

403
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:32,730
key stored in your phone which messes

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,669
with our different attack scenarios we

405
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,059
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier so you got to think</font>

406
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can is the administrator</font>

407
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,889
determine on the back end which

408
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,220
credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> I accept or not from these</font>

409
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:51,570
different ones that the solution offers

410
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:54,179
something to keep in mind another

411
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:58,110
question is when to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use the</font>

412
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:04,710
second factor or maybe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using play</font>

413
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:08,729
I don't know multi-factor typically what

414
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,950
most people are doing these days they

415
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,010
use it when the user establishes the

416
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:19,530
session user logs into the service with

417
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:21,990
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password and a second credential what</font>

418
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,720
may make a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense in certain</font>

419
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:30,390
scenarios think about high value high

420
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:33,840
risk transactions to just ask for that

421
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:36,000
one time password every time in an

422
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,879
existing session the user twice to

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
actually initiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transaction and so</font>

424
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,730
you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I if an attacker was able</font>

425
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,670
to to get one of these one-time

426
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,230
passwords from the user somehow then

427
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,420
that only gets them that file because

428
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,050
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you're trying to do something</font>

429
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:59,309
high value the system will<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompt you</font>

430
00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:02,159
for your second factor another option

431
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously is doing it in this risk-based</font>

432
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,610
context analysis we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

433
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,700
the beginning basically you just use

434
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:16,409
username and password but then whenever

435
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,140
you know you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the</font>

436
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,550
context that look that's abnormal then

437
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,690
you say hey can you please give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

438
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:25,669
second factor as well can<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

439
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,560
inconvenience you to do that so

440
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:31,400
different scenarios you got to think

441
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:33,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advise us your your</font>

442
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,790
risks

443
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,440
another thing that goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

444
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:48,610
do I centrally manage authentication

445
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,549
question is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of all tokens</font>

446
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,879
how do you provision them associate them

447
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:56,350
with user IDs those kind of questions

448
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:02,620
most of you have probably seen these you

449
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:04,480
bikies they emulate a keyboard a USB

450
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">keyboard so you plug them into your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

451
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,029
and they say oh I'm an hid device and

452
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,730
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the user presses this button</font>

453
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,679
on the on the ue key it will spit out a

454
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,320
one-time token we have the keyboard

455
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,200
interface so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user already</font>

456
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">has the cursor on their authentication</font>

457
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:28,360
field and whatever form it will be a

458
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:31,149
right there who will in some ways

459
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,729
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stores the the cooked graphic</font>

460
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:39,668
key that's used for that on the hardware

461
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:43,299
token um so you know compromising the

462
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoint isn't going to get you those</font>

463
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:48,789
keys and it's not even going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you</font>

464
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,350
a token unless the user confirms and

465
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:53,260
presses the button that won't know he

466
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:57,250
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> it token so the user has control</font>

467
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:00,730
over that not so cool in other ways

468
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,289
because they do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an NFC solution but</font>

469
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">it doesn't work with all devices not</font>

470
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:08,470
every device as a USB port however what

471
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,629
they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I thought pretty</font>

472
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Saudis they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,210
of these keys on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tablet at once and</font>

475
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,090
it's connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a workstation that</font>

476
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:27,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically loads 50 unique keys at once</font>

477
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:29,709
on to these individual keys and

478
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:33,130
basically provisions them and associates

479
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:36,460
done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ideas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you so you</font>

480
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:38,590
know at certain time at certain scales

481
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:44,309
you need to think about that's the

482
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:49,030
solution scale of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> uncooked oh</font>

483
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:53,170
that's one of my pet peeves not that I'm

talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having backup solutions</font>

488
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,260
for what you're using and for you know

489
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:07,809
maybe they're being advances in how to

490
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,280
fact a large primes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our say is not</font>

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,870
going to be worth anything all of a

492
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,059
sudden if somebody comes up the way to

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so in your solutions I'm</font>

options of different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crypto</font>

solutions are based on cook to these

days that you can fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> if need</font>

your master<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys gets compromised or</font>

501
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,190
whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,660
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know basically incident</font>

503
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:46,179
preparedness what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do do</font>

we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen in place the other thing</font>

505
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:53,140
with cooked or that you know I like to

506
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:55,659
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use reliable</font>

507
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,700
and trustworthy implementation not go

508
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,000
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement AE as yourself</font>

509
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,960
because unless you are one of the very

510
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,370
few applied mathematicians and in the

511
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,640
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that you're probably</font>

512
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:17,159
going to make mistakes so on this one I

513
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,160
just threw in here for fun more or less

514
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ian be so they are the chip cards that</font>

515
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,580
have been in credit cards around the

516
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:34,030
world forever and finally I know showing

517
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:40,240
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> encoded cards in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US they have a</font>

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:44,920
whole number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different keys in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

519
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that ship and those smart cards which is</font>

520
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,620
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that is and then EMV is a</font>

521
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,510
specific standard that uses a smart card

522
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,889
traditionally have been engineer

523
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:59,250
to be extremely robust against attacks

524
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:02,120
of all sorts basically the assumption is

525
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:04,350
every user of a smart card is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> enemy</font>

526
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,389
because there's no control over what

527
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,520
they can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you know there's</font>

528
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,040
like taking engineered to protect

529
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,430
against differential power analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

530
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:20,010
whatnot so fairly strong hardware token

531
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:22,080
by itself and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> mastercard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

532
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:25,100
visa hopped on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bandwagon came up</font>

533
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,270
with a solution to actually generate

534
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,010
tokens based on the cooked<font color="#CCCCCC"> or that's</font>

535
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,370
already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip and you said for</font>

536
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:35,910
authentication in sessions and then the

537
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:40,050
Germans did something specifically where

538
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:44,640
they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for a given</font>

539
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:49,230
transaction to to another person's bank

540
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,520
account they will actually calculate a

541
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,050
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of signature for based on the</font>

542
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,510
receivers bank account number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

543
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,580
amount that's to be transferred and then

544
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,250
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little smart card reader</font>

545
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,429
handheld smart card reader that shows

546
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and says hey destination amount</font>

547
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,730
is that really what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> then please</font>

548
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,830
place here and i'll enter your<font color="#E5E5E5"> PIN or</font>

549
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,170
whatever and i'll give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this one time</font>

550
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,560
token to use to confirm this transaction

551
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:18,960
and that way actually the user can't

552
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,909
even deny any more that they authorize

553
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,180
that that's other funny solutions funny

554
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:32,070
as an interesting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we generate</font>

555
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,830
like a little pictogram on your web

556
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,389
screen that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then relate into this</font>

557
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,580
device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does the same thing it</font>

558
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,200
shows you a details about the

559
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,129
transaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can confirm or deny</font>

560
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,510
it unfortunately if you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

561
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,300
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be in the position to</font>

562
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:50,820
have the other side of the key material

563
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,460
so not everybody can just go and use EMV

564
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,889
cards in their corporate infrastructure

565
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,210
right if you haven't issued the card you

566
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,400
don't know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key my team here</font>

567
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,900
there's something on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

568
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,900
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was worth mentioning</font>

569
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:10,880
so we've talked a lot about security and

570
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:12,970
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ride scenarios just for</font>

571
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,800
completeness I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention a few</font>

572
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,110
criteria as well that aunt della car to

573
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own security related but that you</font>

574
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,800
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about when</font>

575
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,750
implementing solutions and that just

576
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,300
goes back to general infrastructure

577
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,120
architecture etc and I wouldn't call

578
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,550
myself an expert in it but um I thought

579
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,780
I point<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least out what came to my</font>

580
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:37,820
mind while looking at all these

581
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:40,120
solutions so there's the whole question

582
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,550
how much does it cost in terms of

583
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,010
operating expenses versus one time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

584

<font color="#CCCCCC">for a license for user every year</font>

587
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,910
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about and trusted</font>

588
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,620
this life nice little<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphic here with</font>

589
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,060
all the different types of tokens they

590
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:05,750
support in their solution that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

591
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here open source are the open</font>

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:19,010

596
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,600
go and implement the owl see if you want

597
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,639
it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly straightforward or others</font>

598
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,080
I'm sure lots of people who do that and

599
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,910
you can reuse it apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that I saw</font>

600
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,179
some freemium solutions actually lot

601
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,880
where you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea as well in a</font>

602
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,650
consumer context you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free</font>

604

features central management etc then

605
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:51,550
again we're back to paying money for not

606
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,550
not unexpected I think

607
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,090
integration with identity and access

608
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:02,150
management solutions I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am solutions so</font>

609
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:04,689
again that goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aspect of</font>

610
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:07,520
you know are some money to associate

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,550
tokens or biometric properties or

612
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:13,430
whatever factor i have their passwords

613
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:16,550
with a user in my system they need to

00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reset</font>

615

passwords and reissued tokens and what

616
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:28,460
would biometrics we have a problem all

617
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:32,030
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so interoperability that's</font>

618
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:35,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that the both Josh and Kevin</font>

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,240
planning and implementing potentially in

625
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,400
the future you have the api's and

626
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,740
players etc that you need to actually

627
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,930
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your solutions that solutions to</font>

628
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:06,920
talk with each other those kind of

629
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:09,380
questions so you know yeah how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

630
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,880
integrate so there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to</font>

631
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,120
point out there's an open source

632
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,300
framework I for I am called glue that's

633
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,620
actually based out of Austin here and

634
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,100
there's another one called opening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

635
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:24,379
that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly mature and they</font>

636
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,360
do the it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source but then if you</font>

637
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,870
want to buy our implementation support

638
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,330
etc then you pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

639
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,330
of commercial solutions sales point is

640
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,129
also located<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Austin there's tons</font>

641
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,010
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them you we had some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other pictures</font>

642
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:44,330
and slides earlier I make the slides

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:47,770
available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need to take</font>

644
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">notes sort of point that out earlier</font>

645
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:55,809
usability probably there<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't many end</font>

646
00:33:53,770 --> 00:34:00,610
users that want to carry half a dozen of

647
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:05,139
these tokens on their key chain so so

648
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:10,118
the whole aspect of you know finding the

649
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">right middle between imposing additional</font>

650
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:15,820

651
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,609
additional factor versus the gain you

652
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,310
get out of it and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you make that</font>

653
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:23,710
as smooth as you can and at least

654
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:27,190
burdensome for the user so you know

655
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,190
efficiency availability is it convenient

656
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,649
is it not definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to think</font>

657
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:37,050
about if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not convenient than users</font>

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:37,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">would try to find a way to circumvent it</font>

659
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,480
just general<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture thoughts some</font>

or not is it a cloud-based service or do

we want an appliance and our

669

00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:44,910
the enforcement server side of the

does that mean your users can log on

<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore it's a question you know does it</font>

you lock a two-factor authentication

725
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,330
solution for schools and I was like oh I

726
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,790
going to look at this um

727
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,770
so on their website they<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise you</font>

728
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:16,360
unbreakable security and break the

729
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:19,300
technology patent solutions that are

730
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,840
impenetrable<font color="#CCCCCC"> racicot interesting I</font>

731
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,660
wonder what they actually do so I looked

732
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,750
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the public information on their</font>

733
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:31,620
website etc and try to understand what's

734
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:34,780
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do is</font>

735
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,490
you provision tokens to users and it can

736
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,440
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smart card can be a soft token</font>

737
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,250
later you can plug in different once

738
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:46,030
there and they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> high just somehow</font>

739
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,700
within other education provider here and

740
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,220
then if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug in if a user</font>

741
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:56,529
tries to log into a web-based service or

742
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:58,330
whatever service then that service gets

743
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:03,400
token from the authentication provider

744
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:05,080
if a user actually used his heart were

745
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,960
talking or whatnot to authenticate with

746
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier and so that way to factor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

747
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,640
second factor that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can rely</font>

748
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,740
on I'll being enforced by this

749
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,750
authentication provider that's all fine

750
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:20,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a solution it's a solution</font>

751
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that works the way</font>

752
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,770
they do deal with user provisioning as

753
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,509
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand it correctly might have</font>

754
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:31,120
gotten it wrong they give everybody free

755
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,680
cards a card to use and then to back up

756
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,859
cards that you can lock away somewhere

757
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:40,450
if you do this one and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know</font>

758
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:42,490
its user self-service may not be so

759
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,049
negative it probably isn't snake oil but

760
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,240
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little bit weird you</font>

761
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,830
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a specific patent</font>

762
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,629
I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and now I'm going to</font>

763
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:54,520
implement that to be unique but then I

764
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like well so what do best-in-class</font>

765
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,990
solutions advertise and I looked at the

766
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,050
Gartner Magic Quadrant for 2013 and the

767
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:09,729
best-in-class solution hmm was safe nerd

768
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:14,050
and I looked at their website and<font color="#CCCCCC"> safe</font>

769
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:16,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">net which has a suite of I am solution</font>

770
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,620
and you know different tokens you can

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,579
plug in and whatnot authentication

772
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:23,229
factors market leader

773
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,420
that's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they say well the</font>

774
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:27,578
more factors used the greater the trust

775
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,349
of authenticity doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter which</font>

776
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:34,119
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of factors the more moist better</font>

777
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:37,109
right obviously if you use biometrics

778
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:40,450
and that is three factor authentication

779
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:43,328
and they have the most secure methods

780
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:47,049
out there anyway so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

781
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:48,519
what i'm going to say here is either way

782
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:49,599
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look behind the marketing</font>

783
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:54,459
blog and understand what's actually

784
00:40:49,599 --> 00:41:01,479
going on if you look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution so</font>

785
00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:05,640
our conclusions don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust the</font>

786
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:05,640
marketing hype we just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

787
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:14,200
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say oh everybody is</font>

788
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:16,058
using well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> security tokens are out</font>

789
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,399
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know but everybody's using your</font>

790
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:20,999
smartphone based opens now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go do</font>

791
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,680
that and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more secure um</font>

792
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:25,538
maybe you will be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you really</font>

793
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,339
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand what your exposures</font>

794
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:32,229
and and how to mitigate it whether the

795
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:34,089
solution you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind actually</font>

796
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:36,430
mitigate to exposure otherwise it's just

797
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:38,140
going to be you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks nice on</font>

798
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:40,390
the compliance report but really it

799
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:44,379
doesn't much do much good for your

800
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:46,950
security and then once once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

801
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,089
about it from a security perspective

802
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,529
then you need to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next step and</font>

803
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:55,660
actually think about well is it

804
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:57,940
interoperable with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um is it</font>

805
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,469
usable or maybe they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make a</font>

806
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,599
compromise and use something that's more

807
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:03,219
usable and a little bit more risky

808
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,710
depends on what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do but think</font>

809
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:09,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it dual assessment before you</font>

810
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:13,119
choose settle on the solution that's

811
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:15,130
what I had to say um you can find me in

812
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet talk to me after the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

813
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:20,490
are there any questions as your research

814
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:25,109
providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

815
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:28,589
my whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lives yeah I haven't looked</font>

816
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:31,650
recently at it I looked at it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a talk</font>

817
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,690
that I actually gave at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Embassy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aids</font>

818
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">conference here the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> besides in</font>

819
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:43,530
Austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what they try to do is to</font>

820
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:47,250
standardize the way that different types

821
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:49,950
of tokens interact with different types

822
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:53,940
of authentication enforcement points and

823
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:56,490
they do that by if I remember correctly

824
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,890
or you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and double check i</font>

825
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:02,640
might make stuff up if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

826
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:05,759
correctly they do that by telling you

827
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do certain crypto channel it's</font>

828
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,960
hard to set those up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

829
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,310
have this kind of key here on that end

830
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of key on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that end and</font>

831
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:16,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way you can plug in whatever tokens</font>

832
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:21,900
you learned and they all use the same

833
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:24,619
channel mechanism but that then has its

834
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:30,350
own problem because everybody relies on

835
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:30,350
whatever risks that introduces so these

836
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:37,589
yeah and Google started accepting air so

837
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:43,290
they implemented it yeah mm-hmm other

838
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:46,920
questions cool all right well I hope

839
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:49,579
that's dessert left and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy the</font>

840
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">rest of the titans</font>
