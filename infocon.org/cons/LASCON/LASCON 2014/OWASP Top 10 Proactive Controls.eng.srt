because of you this is what makes our

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,658
who are apart so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,630
OWASP top 10 I have a concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

47
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:10,300
loss top 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of people say</font>

48
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,150
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> offset program on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the olas top 10 and</font>

49
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,390
my thinking we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what about number</font>

50
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,209
11 yeah number 12 so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you should</font>

51
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,589
read the OWASP top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 once and then</font>

52
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,970
never we do that move on to the

53
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,640
application security verification

54
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,769
standard and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard foundation</font>

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,750
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another top 10 presentation</font>

56
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,140
my opinion by the top 10 min is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tory of</font>

57
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,209
another top 10 but I say read it once

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,880
discarded to medford nishal awareness

59
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,769
and then move on to more deep standards

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,200
like application security verification

61
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,880
standard as my only knowledge about

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,880
second progressed the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years</font>

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you lost top ten used to be what am I go</font>

64
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,579
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> frys documents and I shifted most of</font>

65
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,030
my work i trade my all focus on the aspx

66
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's like people wass topic 196 much</font>

67
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,530
more comprehensive and those you care

68
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,180
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sapir requirements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

69
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,400
a shift in that direction so I digress

70
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,450
so top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is again this</font>

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,590
presentation is meant for an initial

72
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,018
awareness for developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

73
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,930

than just XSS because any cross-site

I've seen that we can take

220
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,170
and huge just a parent and skip the

to step back is your building a user

273

recently so the encoding that escaping

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,690
is a primary defense to deter dangerous

275

277
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,200
characters to escape contact so this is

278

our main defensive layer against

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,300

here in the room really strict language

specific input validation for the sake

296
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,860
of security internationalisation the

297
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,300
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably no lot of us pump can</font>

298
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,589
use a printable character regular

299
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,589
expression to handle their

300
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:19,079
naturalization so input validation tends

301
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,120
to get weaker over time it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you should depend upon that</font>

303

writing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit into imagemagick</font>

that would great that process already

file upload technology to work well so

379
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:32,269
next let's implement appropriate access

controls so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that were the</font>

greatest failings of us as a security

382
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:40,100
community is not providing developers

383
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,440
with good access control layers most how

384
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:47,720
most frameworks deal with access control

385
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,760
today all right raw waste so I'm in

hard code and applications I like it as

388
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,630
it's ugly the design weakness at the

is the important point because we get

the enforcement point correct everything

got knocked out of every browser chrome

got rid of him right away microsoft

794
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,510
them mobile apps very easy we can hard

795
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,030
code then into chrome on Android pretty

796
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,160
easy we have experimental headers and

797
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,160
chrome and firefox today to let you

798

attackers maybe it will steal info from

802
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,870
that's kind of warning that people got

803
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,659
when they happen in the middle the other

804
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,159
thing we have that's really neat is a

perfect forward secrecy ephemeral

806
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,850
psychosis up until recently if I stole

807
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the private key to your ssl server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

808
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:17,090
decrypt any ID decrypt a traffic over

809
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,710
SSL with a history of that server here

810
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,230
now we have a federal service<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaves</font>

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,150
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key and the keys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

itself have nothing to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

814
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,530
other so if i crack your key and review

815
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,420
some plain fact on ssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get a little</font>

817
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:38,240
for every chunk of data I'm trying

818
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:41,240
it really makes advanced adversaries who

819
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,430
are using massive hardware to crack ssl

820
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,700
that it committed it off their

821
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,930
capabilities in significant ways and now

822
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no I'm not trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

widely supported them as spc on the top

830
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,070
yeah so if you want to use ephemeral

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,070
overall there should be a talk here I

835
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,020
would just add one last hour there's a

of how isolation of the real hallmark of

874
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:56,170
key management is you I select a nicely

back after application goes into a

876

separate service reduces the problem to

877
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,500
this authentication and access control

878
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,240
from that going on you also have any

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,400
well let's talk about you can actually

886
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,770
for a moment when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a web</font>

application complicated web service some

kind of custom enterprise software but

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,040
not the end up putting a product in

891
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,220
choosing detection i think is available

892
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,100
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way world we</font>

the application itself as much as

00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:55,180
possible so things like I see someone's

trying to modify in a beautiful feel

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,290
reform into your check or uncheck I

899
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,350
either get the value or an empty string

900
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,660
and invite anything else someone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">away p so this is an example of</font>

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,910
intrusion detection prevention that you

would embed either software itself we

equal jection abuse of a multi-step

908
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:26,680
workflow is like a custom business logic

909
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,359
but I'd like put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price as a variable</font>

910
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,129
in a shopping cart<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose there's a</font>

913
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:39,009
a shopping cart right you see like a

<font color="#CCCCCC">and so what I think I put the price</font>

920
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,459
isn't veritable into the shopping cart

921
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and introduce it I actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ID</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a honey trap coat see if</font>

926
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,480
it's something that anyhow we can help

<font color="#CCCCCC">themselves for price I gotta reduce it</font>

928
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,809
right a lot of research I've seen as an

intrusion detection I heroes are recall

John Valentin coats in the box after 13

935
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,339
we have a pretty rigorous java project

936
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,920
to allow them to add sensor points even

937
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:41,619
code for the sake of a truth detection

938
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,240
and even code much better than our

understanding of our software works we

941
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:51,308
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a go deep into this book there</font>

942
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,010
are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> good controls built into</font>

initial steps is truly to have mastery

00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,420
of their framework and understand the

does is important to know but not to use

954
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,599
them if you have a really rigorous

955
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,270
access control requirements of the

cock-eyed earlier using<font color="#E5E5E5"> their frameworks</font>

957
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,610
access control is usually a really bad

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:36,040
idea so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just important or when</font>

here let's talk about security

00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,650
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever gotten parents in</font>

the scope of your entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> quarter good</font>

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:09,070
none I've ever gotten prescriptive

976
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,020
would also have a good security

requirements as part of their soccer

978
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:35,820
bellmore how detailed pretty detailed

979
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:40,149
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the example of a book regularity</font>

980
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,520
you will implement checkpoints for input

validation Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> echevarria so what it</font>

982
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,890
really was if technically good strip

983
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,330
they're out of our spirit we also wrote

984
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,540
most of their requirements that we got

985
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,540
back

986
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,750
and you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> given if you're not even</font>

clear security wireless we need a bill

988
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,040
you're usually not gonna build to that

989
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:07,770
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build two requirements</font>

990
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,020
and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want and very often</font>

991
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:12,030
accompanied is demanding security of

992
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,619
developers without telling them what

993
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means and we need to tell</font>

994
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:18,000
developers what that means if we have

995

any<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance any hope of building secure</font>

996
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,160

last but not least if your architecture

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,849
and design this some people call this

threat modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it more to</font>

1031
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:48,700
building kind of kind of vision where I

and headaches office about the

1038
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,109
modifications there in a more gentle

1039
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:08,380
fashion some people say you want an iron

1040
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:10,538
fist show up and change the answer sdlc

1041
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,450
and make everyone change how we write

1042
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:17,710
software if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you will lose</font>

1044
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,420
good developers is a very competitive

1045
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:24,670
market out there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I better luck in</font>

1046
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,190
terms of retention actually maybe what I

1047
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,140
want Oh taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the developers are</font>

1048
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,390
doing today and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make small</font>

1049
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:34,058
changes embracing their current culture

1050
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:36,879
this requires a high peak you requires a

1051
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:39,039
good interpersonal skills and the desire

1052
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,319
to understand first before you make

1053
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions it's not our nature in this</font>

1054
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:45,940
industry so this is

1055
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">a difficult difficult thing to do well</font>

1056
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,180
and I that<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely processes are more</font>

1057
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,520
successful than expensive heavyweight

00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that pops up in the area of architecture</font>

her in this kind of software fractional

1066
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:21,130
second legs mean billions of dollars so

1067
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,770
they have a whole different<font color="#CCCCCC"> mission of a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trust is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and what periods and they have</font>

certain layers of their architecture

1071
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,589
because again<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10m escalade is going to</font>

1072
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,560
mean billions of dollars in that

1073
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:38,050
situation so we do have specialized my

1074
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,690
vision is treat all input always is

1075
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,520
untrusted and used security build every

1076
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:45,010
component to be self dependent that's

1077
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,720
ideal but certain situations come up

1078
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:53,890
with that's not practical or even

1079
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:55,839
possible and so yeah so I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1080
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:00,118
listening I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope it was useful to you in</font>

1081
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,119
some way any<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bishop</font>

1083
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,120
sequel databases do you see objection

1084
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,000
into those systems and are there any

1085
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,770
mitigations around it's like primary

1086
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,500
square has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around forever but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1087
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,540
with no sequel so what kind of tools of

1088
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,030
our generation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aces</font>

1089
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,830
people would programmatically query into

1090
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:25,050
those with function calls that's like

1091
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:27,540
getting get the data of this time within

1092
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,160
and then sort by this adult function

1093
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">base some will have equalised button and</font>

1094
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,950
then some which is all now have an old

1095
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:37,410
ql like very language to do advanced

1096
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,480
queries because using programmatic

1097
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,730
function calls to query into a very

1098
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,890
complex data set for advanced search

1099
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,500
capability is not tenable you get up

1100
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:49,319
having to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> oq it up and move what's</font>

1101
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,900
oql oql is an object query language

1102
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,870
that's often a mix of your queries and

1103
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,940
untrusted data so you can help object

1104

query<font color="#E5E5E5"> injection against the no sequel</font>

1106
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,960
you like bearings and so in those cases

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll just like using HQ L I grenade</font>

so it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop up even the no sequel</font>

world on occasion and more and more

of a problem still there don't ever
