00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,038
good morning everybody my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lance</font>

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,840
fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the CEO of cab board we build</font>

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,869
web and mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications I've been in</font>

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,430
custom software development for 30-plus

5
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:34,190
years today's talk is about

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:37,760
understanding and implementing rugged

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:41,480
this is a pretty abstract<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level</font>

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,879
thought and what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do today</font>

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">is try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little bit less abstract</font>

10
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,870
talk about some real world examples give

11
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,809
you some specific items that you can

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,169
then turn around and apply in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

13
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:59,949
life apply in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own software at your</font>

14
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:05,150
own organization at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

15
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:12,770
rugged is about software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is secure</font>

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:17,090
and reliable and maintainable those are

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,729
the top three level things I studied a

18
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,590
lot of a lot of Steve Jobs and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

19
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,920
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take any concept in every</font>

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,870
concept and every event and boil it down

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,909
to three things so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you something</font>

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,480
you could walk away with and if there's

23
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:33,380
nothing else that you get from today's

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,520
discussion and if you want to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,649
and leave early those are the three

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,750
things right there so let's get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

27
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the detail but before</font>

28
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:51,710
we do so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about let's talk</font>

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,330
about the challenge of being rugged I've

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">never really been a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fan of Batman</font>

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,048
I've got three boys at home now ages 2 4

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,210
and 6 and they're in their kind of

33
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:01,970
superhero stage and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing a</font>

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,619
lot of thinking about about rugged and

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,990
what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rugged and to live</font>

36
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,330
rugged on a daily basis and Batman can

37
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,780
in my mind kind of personifies what that

38
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:15,620
is but Batman of course as we all know

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a fictional character Bruce Lee</font>

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,010
however was a real life character and

41
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,480
there's many others out there that you

42
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,599
could pick but the reason i picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> bruce</font>

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">lee is because he's got some great art</font>

44
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:31,579
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also because he really exemplified a</font>

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">top notch martial artist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a low</font>

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,750
bit of martial arts background and one

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do in martial arts</font>

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,360
is we we step through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Coty's we</font>

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:43,390
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of practicing a lot of sparring</font>

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,190
and that is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the number-one</font>

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,790
premises of rugged is that we're

52
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,430
constantly practicing and sparring and

53
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,980
learning challenging one another i

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,720
almost put up a slide about you know the

55
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">fight club the movie fight club because</font>

56
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,340
that's that's what it's all about

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,220
setting a standard not just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

58
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,390
but for for your peers and your social

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,730
organization those who you work with on

60
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,589
a day-to-day basis and doing so a lot of

61
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,410
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> love and respect and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

62
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,270
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to command and demand more</font>

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,270
from ourselves and war from each other

64
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,989
the whole rugged movement kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got</font>

65
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:32,420
started in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2010 2011 I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found these</font>

66
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:35,090
slides from 2012 that was suggesting

67
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:41,268
that there are some rugged attributes

68
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:43,580
that you could break down and discover

69
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,650
more about what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rugged by</font>

70
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,750
exploring some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these attributes and</font>

71
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,080
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about my personal my</font>

72
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,750
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> makeup the way that my brain</font>

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">works is I really resonate with this</font>

74
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of of trying to capture a</font>

75
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:06,470
particular aspect of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and</font>

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,299
identifying it as being<font color="#E5E5E5"> good or bad and</font>

77
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,760
then either accelerating it or

78
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,530
decelerating it but my point<font color="#CCCCCC"> being is</font>

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:17,120
that there were only six attributes back

80
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:21,798
in in 2012 and along with<font color="#CCCCCC"> James wicket</font>

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Josh Corman Matt Conda I've been

82
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending a lot of time thinking about</font>

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,919
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've continued to tweak some</font>

84
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,870
of them and add some additional

85
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,510
attributes but I think most importantly

86
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,229
as we started grouping them together

87
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,990
because I being in being in the software

88
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:44,120
business and trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain rugged to</font>

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,460
my customers and even my employees if

90
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,580
you

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,310
start listing off 10 plus attributes

92
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,669
their eyes just<font color="#CCCCCC"> glaze over and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

93
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,940
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommended that we we just</font>

94
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:59,039
embrace secure reliable and maintainable

95
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,349
but you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stop there you have</font>

96
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go the next level to understand what</font>

97
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,520
to do with those and so what we're going

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,289
to do today is we're going to step down

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,690
through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these talk about a</font>

100
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of examples of each of them this</font>

101
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,039
is totally wide open please feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

102
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,020
stop me at any point<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask questions or if</font>

103
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good example either in</font>

104
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,789
software or in the real world please

105
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,009
raise your hand and and let me know so

106
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,710
first we're going to step through the

107
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,750
the various secure attributes and one

108
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,560
thing I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out is I am</font>

109
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,530
a lifelong software developer I don't

110
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,449
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a security background and I've</font>

111
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,549
already shared with you that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

112
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:43,199
resonated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of these</font>

113
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:46,069
attributes but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a secure</font>

114
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,090
background a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> background so I</font>

115
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,070
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a difficult time</font>

116
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:52,080
understanding how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break out security</font>

117
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,090
into something more than just defensible

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,219
and sensible so if you're if this

119
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,479
particular topic interests you this

120
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,520
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great and if you have a</font>

121
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,340
security background please feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,109
jump in there's there's areas that we

123
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,250
can contribute and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll start</font>

124
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,789
to understand a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

125
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">why we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this so the idea of</font>

126
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">something being secure protected against</font>

127
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,258
attack or other criminal activity

128
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,030
there's not much about security today

129
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,039
that I can teach you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

130
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,698
already know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day</font>

131
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,620
our customers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trusting us with their</font>

132
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,440
data with their information with their

133
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,509
transactions with their commerce and we

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,969
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do everything that we can do to</font>

135
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:39,719
secure that transaction and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

136
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:43,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data defensibility was in fact one</font>

137
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:48,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original attributes and the</font>

138
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">original idea for defense ability is</font>

139
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:53,820
that an application should be able to

140
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,220
identify when it is being misused or

141
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,379
abused and immediately react to

142
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,000
theoretically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DDoS attack</font>

143
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:04,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> along those lines</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I want</font>

of security or through<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lens of</font>

151
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,419
software is we're forgetting to open our

minds and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

153
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:29,628
different possibilities out there so for

<font color="#E5E5E5">example when we look at some of the</font>

00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:35,780
older or architecture in in Eastern

156
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,580
Europe this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly defensible</font>

157
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,948
structure because it is simply very

158
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,639
difficult to get up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where</font>

159
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,650
you can actually get access to it

160
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,250
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more applicable to</font>

161
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,500
our lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> today you know understanding</font>

162
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,509
understanding your threats understanding

163
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,090
your enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this particular case</font>

164
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,449
the threat is wildfires in California

165
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,400
and so they attempted to put a

166
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,669
multi-million dollar home up on the top

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this hill and create a defensible</font>

168
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,099
perimeter as you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell by the</font>

169
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,990
nature of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font>

170
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,360
home it didn't work and in this

171
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,389
particular case embers from the fire

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,250
where we're rolling along the sandy

173
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,529
structure and then up the hill because

174
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,779
there was simply nothing to stop the

175
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:28,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">ember so it wasn't the fire itself but</font>

176
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,139
the remnants of the fire if you're a big

177
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,229
fan of Star Trek we all know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

178
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,698
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shields shields almost never</font>

179
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:39,500
worked in fact when they worked it was

180
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:41,208
pretty boring so and it's a it's much

181
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,130
more interesting when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work</font>

182
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,489
and so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about something like</font>

183
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,110
the shields to protect photon torpedoes

184
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,589
well that almost always worked assuming

185
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:55,660
something else wasn't broken on the ship

186
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:58,459
but frequently they would run into

187
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,500
enemies that weren't shooting them with

188
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,890
photon torpedoes they had yet a new

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,470
weapon right and so understanding your

190
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,810
your threat and having a defense for

191
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular threat is</font>

192
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:16,219
is a good start but it's not where it

193
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,460
ends understanding the fact that our<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

194
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:25,140
our enemies could in fact be potentially

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:28,050
more agile than we are and then the

196
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:34,439
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> attribute that I've I've put under</font>

197
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:37,140
security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensibility or the act of</font>

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:42,360
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensible processing or displaying</font>

199
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,640
sensitivity and prudence so an example

200
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,580
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this would be this the idea that</font>

201
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,010
software itself should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

202
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,540
similar to defense ability should be

203
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:59,040
able to detect how it's being used but

204
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">then to have the the sense to know how</font>

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,560
to respond to that potential misuse and

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,570
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that here a little bit</font>

207
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,829
more so here here's an interesting

208
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,930
example of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey this is actually not</font>

209
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,310
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a can of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

210
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,770
ornament but it's an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

211
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,010
so this is not a cannon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I would</font>

212
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to protect my castle because it is</font>

213
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,790
in and of itself impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use due</font>

214
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,160
to its<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point being here that</font>

215
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,260
you wouldn't necessarily even if this

216
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:35,939
were a real cannon want to use this

217
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:40,670
cannon if the particular attack weren't

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,410
of equal measure so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone were just</font>

219
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,490
loitering on your property certainly

220
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,010
that would not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the appropriate</font>

221
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:50,700
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norwood an intercontinental</font>

222
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ballistic missile so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea</font>

223
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:59,400
of in the military of symmetric response

224
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:04,020
or perhaps more interestingly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

225
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">symmetric response so meeting fire with</font>

226
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:12,600
fire supposedly right and so in in the

227
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,990
military this is there's there's a lot

228
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,450
to be learned about the science<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

229
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,510
given this attack we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will respond with</font>

230
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,030
these measures so here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

231
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:27,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">symmetric response</font>

232
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:29,040
so can you find your enemy in this

233
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,910
picture well it's too late you're

234
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:38,910
already dead right asymmetric response

235
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:41,610
terrorism so there they are and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

236
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:47,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">alone even if you saw him this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy would</font>

237
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:51,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">have got you so let's move on to</font>

238
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:58,290
reliability anybody have any comments or

239
00:11:51,090 --> 00:12:01,620
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay reliable</font>

240
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:05,370
so reliable is a attribute that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added</font>

241
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a an uncle who is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they has a</font>

242
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,690
doctorate he's a professor up at Baylor

243
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,020
University and I went and talked to him

244
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,510
about rugged and he introduced to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

245
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,699
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reliable software and I guess</font>

246
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,040
reliable software was a there was a

247
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big push for it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 90s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

248
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,099
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rugged of the 90s but it was</font>

249
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,780
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had never heard of they</font>

250
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,400
didn't teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to me in school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

251
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,870
are the types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we have to</font>

252
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,060
learn and in our regular everyday job

253
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately we're we're getting paid</font>

254
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,400
to learn by customers who we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

255
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,990
better serving reliability<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

256
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,069
consistently good in quality or

257
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:50,250
performance and able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be trusted my</font>

258
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,680
wife<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a psychologist and I asked her</font>

259
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,810
when i said when i say reliable what do

260
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,040
you think of her background suggested

261
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,020
that something is the perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

262
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,140
reliability or something that is

263
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,600
reliable is a tape measure they said

264
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:11,310
that that is anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font>

265
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">to measure the response or particular</font>

266
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:19,260
situation is deemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliable however</font>

267
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:23,580
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily always deemed as</font>

268
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:27,270
valid which is probably yet another yet

269
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:30,620
another discussion all together so when

270
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,620
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about reliable software</font>

271
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:41,930
or reliable systems or organizations

272
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:46,040
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about a system or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a person</font>

273
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:50,300
or or software that is responding in a

274
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:54,620
way that we r us that we are expecting

275
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,150
and it's and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always there now</font>

276
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,680
what's interesting about reliable is

277
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,610
that there's many different things about

278
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,260
reliability that that make up something

279
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reliable which is why we kind of</font>

280
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:09,439
made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a parent attribute so one of the</font>

281
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,630
first attributes within that kind of

282
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,300
contribute to that family of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliability</font>

283
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:17,500
is the attribute of being durable able

284
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,290
to withstand where pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> or damage</font>

285
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard-wearing and long-lasting and so</font>

288
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,939
longevity and as I was just been staring

289
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,640
at this and thinking through this topic

290
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,250
I've replaced longevity with durable

291
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,569
because durable is something that lasts

292
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:44,780
a long time but it also has a few more a

293
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,930
few more assumptions about it for

294
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,810
example when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about software in</font>

295
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,239
automobiles and Josh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korman is looking</font>

297
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,180

301
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:13,460
similar physical items into our

302
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,040
customers hands so but a system that is

303
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:19,700
not unreliable that is an automobile for

304
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:25,810
example could potentially catastrophic

307
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,070
wearable technologies that are coming

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:39,680
today anyone heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tizen TI is een</font>

309
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:43,280

Linux

312
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:49,050
which is being placed on on watches and

313
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:53,489
so we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these watches are going</font>

314
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:55,829
to be banged up against walls and misuse

315
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:57,660
and abuse not necessarily by way of a

316
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,329
hacker although i'm sure that will will

317
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,399
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true they need to be able to</font>

318
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:06,469
withstand being dropped and banged

319
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,999
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are familiar</font>

320
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,769
actually this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i just</font>

321
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently heard believe it or not i think</font>

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">on NVR NPR the other day but we're</font>

323
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:20,970
starting to create self-healing concrete

324
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:24,149
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost impossible to believe</font>

325
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:28,199
but it's true so there are real world

326
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:30,989
examples of actual physical items that

327
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,359
can in fact self heal this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

328
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:36,749
concrete part of its self healing nature

329
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,779
is that it actually breaks into various

330
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:42,569
micro fissures instead of larger cracks

331
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,689
and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of something being</font>

332
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:47,339
durable means that it is bendable and so

333
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:53,549
we all think of Ben gate at this point

334
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:55,049
right so it's sometimes when you look at

335
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:57,389
item like this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to figure out</font>

336
00:16:55,049 --> 00:17:00,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">well how does this work in in the</font>

found in the real world in our pockets

344
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,279
so they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to withstand you</font>

345

00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:30,840
durations of time the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

347
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,639
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is the Great Wall of China</font>

348
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:40,020
right because it's been around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7,000</font>

349
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:42,870
years not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pieces and parts</font>

350
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,960
have been no lasting along that long but

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we still</font>

see today was just built during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ming</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the History Channel the other day</font>

358
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,580
about

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,860
101 top inventions and wooden pegs is in

360
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,730
there what's interesting to me about

361
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,770
wooden pegs is that some of the oldest

362
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,370
man-made structures on the planet today

363
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">are made with wooden pegs which to me is</font>

364
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:20,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">just it blows my mind but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of</font>

365
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the day it's because if you place a bolt</font>

366
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,330
we all would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know a bolt</font>

367
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,780
is going to last a wooden bolt is going

368
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,850
to last longer than a wooden peg but

369
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,770
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of wooden pegs is that</font>

370
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,699
they'll expand and contract at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

371
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:38,280
rate and the same amount based on

372
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether as the structure around it so</font>

373
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,230
the peg and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure itself or both</font>

374
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,049
are both adjusting at the same rate so

375
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,559
then the overall the overall component

376
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:51,780
stays together and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't heard</font>

377
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:56,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that 10,000 year clock it's being</font>

378
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:59,399
designed now sponsored by Jeff Bezos of

379
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:02,970
Amazon and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually building a</font>

380
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,160
clock that they intend to chime and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

381
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,510
gets once a century<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once every</font>

382
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,309
thousand years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's going to</font>

383
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:12,510
be a cuckoo that comes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000</font>

384
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:15,000
years nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wants a clock just</font>

385
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a clock on that last 10,000</font>

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,980
years but the idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to adopt</font>

387
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,410
this long-term thinking to think about

388
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,750
what it might look like if we started

389
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,690
spending more time focusing on quality

390
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:35,640
of the things the things that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

391
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:38,640
products that we build it's the exact

392
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,630
opposite of these cheap toys that we buy

393
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,990
that last in some cases less than an

394
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:49,260
hour it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most frustrating</font>

395
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,820
things for me as a as a parent what's

396
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting about this 10,000 year clock</font>

397
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,780
is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to be built in a</font>

398
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,600
mountain I think it's like two stories

399
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,030
tall and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Texas</font>

400
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,740
in in West Texas so<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday when they</font>

401
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,040
get it built it will actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

402
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,809
tourist<font color="#E5E5E5"> attraction so but if you can</font>

403
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,090
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of engineering that's</font>

404
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:11,750
involved in creating something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

405
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">last that long</font>

406
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,110
something must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available in order for</font>

407
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,939
it to be reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it must be suitable</font>

408
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:27,959
and ready for use it must be of use or

409
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,690
service and at hand so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to think</font>

410
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,820
of software is needing to be scalable

411
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,610
and used to talk about scalability a lot

412
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,129
but scalability is something that

413
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,709
contributes to software being available

414
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,830
so scalability itself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an</font>

415
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:46,140
attribute but<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly is part of a</font>

416
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,809
contributing factor of availability and

417
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,360
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world example is is a</font>

418
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:54,000
butler who's always there or a lost

419
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,979
puppy dog right who's always just

420
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,870
following you around and being available

421
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,490
to do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you want at</font>

422
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:05,668
any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to be</font>

423
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,250
said for for software that where the

424
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,919
engineers have spent the extra time to

425
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,490
engineer it in such a way that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

426
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:19,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">available what's most embarrassing is</font>

427
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:23,179

when software is built<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the big</font>

431
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,750
announcement has been made thousands of

432
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,419
people come to view the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

433
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,919
it's simply not there if they get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 404</font>

435
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,760

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day it's it's who our</font>

most important one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most important</font>

441
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:06,000
so recoverability is an interesting one

442
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,790
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that even even if we are</font>

443
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,250
Batman we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to fail from time to</font>

444
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,570
time we started today's session by

445
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,540
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> Batman and get his butt kicked</font>

446
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:20,070
it does happen we've all had failure in

447
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:22,530
our in our day but we must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

448
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,540
recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that when it comes to</font>

449
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,639
software a good example

450
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,570
of software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is recoverable is</font>

451
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,640
software that has an agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just</font>

452
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,620
checks to see if other software is alive

453
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and ticking and if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it restarts</font>

454
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,669
it one particular scenario they heard

455
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,650
with regard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> recoverability is where</font>

456
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:47,070
multiple nodes were it would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

457
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:49,620
then they all had the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same retry</font>

458
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,080
recoverability algorithm so that would

459
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,330
retry in five seconds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then 15</font>

460
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,610
seconds and then one<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute and when all</font>

461
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,220
of the nodes went down five seconds

462
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">later they all tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come back up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

463
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:04,140
the same time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they of course</font>

464
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,430
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeed they wait 15 seconds</font>

465
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,010
and then they all try to come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

466
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so eventually you know a human had</font>

467
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,129
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved and say well let's get</font>

468
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,740
this thing spun up one at a time and get

469
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">things going and a good example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

470
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,740
which I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of at the time I</font>

471
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,139
was putting the presentation together

472
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,870
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the energy grid that we use</font>

473
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,200
here in America we've had many many

474
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:28,830
blackouts due to due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the lack of</font>

475
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:34,410
reliability or recoverability of those

476
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,669
energy grids survivability now so here's

477
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,230
here's where we get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

478
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more abstract and</font>

479
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,680
and I might already have your mind

480
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:44,100
spinning a little bit because some of

481
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,500
these seem so related survivability is a

482
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,469
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example of where we've said</font>

483
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay even though this particular</font>

484
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,280
attribute could be interpreted by others

485
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,200
as meaning something else for the sense

486
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,879
of being rugged for the sense of

487
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,060
understanding rugged and implementing

488
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,220
rugged let's talk about how

489
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,860
survivability specifically has to do

490
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,740
with capable of withstanding attack or

491
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:12,540
perhaps more importantly to remain or

492
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:20,160
continue in existence or use so for here

493
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:24,629
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about what I'm going to talk</font>

494
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so here we're thinking about</font>

495
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps like a reliability or dependence</font>

496
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,689
on a third party system so if you have

497
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,630
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system that is reliant on that</font>

498
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,920
third party system being available and

499
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,650
then

500
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,670
discover that it's not then your system

501
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:47,340
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smart enough to know how to</font>

502
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:50,940
react to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that system not being available</font>

503
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,860
and to then to gracefully approach the

504
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,590
situation rather than the blue screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

505
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,229
death right approach the user and

506
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:01,470
explain to them this particular service

507
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:04,080
is not available we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> email you we can</font>

508
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:08,400
SMS you check back in five minutes

509
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:11,820
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> along those lines everybody</font>

510
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,720
knows the idea of Survivor in this

511
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:18,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular case we've got someone who's</font>

512
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,010
anyone ever do bungee cord I've always

513
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,960
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it never had the</font>

514
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,629
opportunity but in this particular case

515
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,020
we have we have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing bungee over</font>

516
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:28,950
water which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is smart right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

517
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,430
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be one hundred percent</font>

518
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:35,850
reliant on that particular chord so the

519
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of implementing a safety net in</font>

520
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,639
your system a safety net that says if

521
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,890
this should fail my users are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

522
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,760
end up here how should I handle this

523
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:50,070
situation in such a way that I don't

524
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">detract from their experience to such a</font>

525
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,679
degree that they won't return or<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst</font>

526
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,120
case they'll actually tell folks don't

527
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,470
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go there because that was a</font>

528
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible experience that didn't work for</font>

529
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:06,000
me so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a real world</font>

530
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,360
example of in mobile development so we

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,930
run into those a lot in application

532
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,780
development the idea that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

533
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:20,160
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend a user experience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

534
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:22,470
customers but we cannot rely on the fact

535
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,760
that Wi-Fi is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available or</font>

536
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,330
that cell service is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

537
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">available so then we're immediately put</font>

538
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,159
in a situation where every single line

539
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,380
of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we write we have to think</font>

540
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,430
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the state</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

541
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:41,700
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the world and I think this</font>

542
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really a good point to suggest that</font>

543
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,870
when we're talking about rugged rugged

544
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:51,450
isn't necessarily just looking at

545
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,000
security and reliability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain</font>

546
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,480
in coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back after the fact after a</font>

547
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,190
product has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed and concerning</font>

548
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself with those attributes at that</font>

549
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,789
time when you're writing software you

550
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,260
need to be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with the idea of</font>

551
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,179
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reliability and</font>

552
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,480
maintainability in mind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire time</font>

553
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:15,750
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this responsibility that</font>

554
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,980
we have it's hard to go back in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

555
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:21,720
undo something that you've done wrong

556
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,269
predictability is an interesting one

557
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,440
again we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the overall</font>

558
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:30,269
reliability of the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found some</font>

559
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,779
really good examples of predictability

560
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:36,269
in total quality management which is

561
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that that exists more in the</font>

562
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:42,510
manufacturing world and so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

563
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,928
is that when you're manufacturing for

564
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,760
example bricks the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the</font>

565
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:50,159
implementation and manufacturing of

566
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,639
those bricks must in itself be a

567
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">reliable and rugged system with the</font>

568
00:27:53,639 --> 00:28:00,889
reason being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if these bricks are</font>

569
00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:05,100

behave the same way than any any other

571

future product that's built down the

572
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,779
road with these sub components will be

573
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:15,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">in an also unreliable so there's that</font>

learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about total quality management</font>

577
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,240
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can learn in the</font>

software world about quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say</font>

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll say you that so Legos a great</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we can talk about you know all of the</font>

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,350
cheap toys that there are out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

584
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:45,149
world you know Lego has been around for

585
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,668
a long long time I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's so over a</font>

586
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:52,590
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and they almost went</font>

587
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:55,230
bankrupt completely bankrupt in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

588
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,019
early 2000s and part of the reason is

589
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they started jumping out into</font>

590
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:05,130
other other lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> of products other</font>

591
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,690
lines of toys and they started innovate

592
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">in so many different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

593
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,560
practically bring bankrupt the company

594
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,140
but the reason they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

595
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,510
out of fear because their patent for

596
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,160
their brick had expired<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of a</font>

597
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,230
sudden tons of competitors were coming

598
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,660
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and replicating what they were doing</font>

599
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,150
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Lego forgot was that they</font>

600
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really did they had already invested</font>

601
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,860
literally millions and billions of

602
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:31,140
dollars in engineering the best brick

603
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:35,250
and that's when they realized we just

604
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:37,470
need to continue to be the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

605
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,300
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing now but i can</font>

606
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,760
tell you when i discovered this about

607
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,010
lego i had mega<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloks and some other</font>

608

blocks that were in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> house and the</font>

609
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,629
kids never played with them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:51,420
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same reliable click</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">every time I I gave him I gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him away</font>

614
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,600
talking about predictability the idea

615
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,060
that when you take one block and place

616
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:07,199
it on the other that predictable

617
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,750
behavior needs to be there but there's a

618
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,520
catch with predictability though

619
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,620
predictability isn't always necessarily

620
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,129
a good thing so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to our</font>

621
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:19,189
scenario here where we're talking about

622
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:22,410
defense ability or sensibility an

623
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:24,990
asymmetric response so part of the thing

624
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,700
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned predictability to to an</font>

625
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,320
associate of mine who has a strong

626
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,880
military background if he always thought

627
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,460
of predictability as being a very very

628
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,340
bad thing because now we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that</font>

629
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,770
guy is and if he's there every time you

631

has gone down to almost zero so they

632
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,170
have to remain unpredictable in that

633
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular case so this this particular</font>

634

attribute needs a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

research<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's going to be</font>

638

conditionally not all things should be

639
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:03,680
predictable and as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys know in the</font>

world of security or military

641
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:11,250
predictable behavior can be used against

642
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:15,479
you so questions about questions about

643
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,680
reliability cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got about 10 more</font>

644
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,190
minutes I'm going to shoot through

645
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,870
maintainability

646
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,120
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up spending a lot of time in my</font>

647
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,189
world working on maintainability because

648
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,610
we've adopt a lot of a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

649
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:32,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">software systems and not all of them are</font>

650
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:35,010
ones that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created there's a lot of</font>

651
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,800
bad software in this world or poorly in

652
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:41,220
this engineered poorly designed software

653
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,159
it's a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem an epidemic in</font>

654
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,980
my mind if something is maintainable if

655
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:54,570
you can keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in an appropriate</font>

656
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">condition and keep it unimpaired this is</font>

657
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:03,540
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to do the ideal world</font>

658
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:08,750
everything would be built of such<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

659
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:11,639
quality that it rarely needs repaired

660
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:15,870
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

661
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:18,480
happen so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I think of when I</font>

662
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:21,540
think of a maintainability and this is

663
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:28,290
an access panel for the back of a shower

664
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:30,330
or a tub and when when this system were

665
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,740
designed they knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point</font>

666
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to have to maintain it</font>

667
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,570
so they built<font color="#E5E5E5"> an access panel all</font>

668
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,730
systems need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way to easily get</font>

669
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the various components of the system</font>

670
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:46,230
that need to be tweaked in order to

671
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the behavior or in order to fix</font>

672
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,720
or repair a system there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

673
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,290
on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that believe it or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's</font>

674
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,240
various standards the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of convention</font>

675
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,040
when he opens that access panel he's

676
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,130
pretty sure he knows what he's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

677
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:04,110
see and he knows how to repair it the

678
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,380
idea that something needs to be agile<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

679
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,550
huge it's very very difficult to

680
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain a system that is not agile</font>

681
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:17,629
marked by an ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think or change</font>

682
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:21,210
quickly my favorite example here is i

683
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:23,160
love i love border collies<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

684
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,530
particular fan of watching you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know dogs</font>

685
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,540
run around and do stuff but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

686
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,490
whenever I searched for agility on

687
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,200
google images it was just littered with

688
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,730
dogs because I guess they do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

689
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,100
training what's what's particularly

690
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,130
interesting in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is the</font>

691
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,928
fact that while this dog is actually

692
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,220
jumping he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already looking elsewhere</font>

693
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,470
and thinking about what he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

694
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,000
doing next and that makes me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

695
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:52,779
Batman or Bruce Lee agility is very

696
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,600
similar to flexibility this makes me

697
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:57,960
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Ruby on Rails the way that it</font>

698
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">is an agile web development framework</font>

699
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:05,529
it's built on convention similar to the

700
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:07,389
access panel a developer will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

701
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into a system built on Ruby on Rails</font>

702
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:12,609
and we'll know where everything is and

703
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:18,369
know where to to go to tweak various

704
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:20,859
things but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day agility</font>

705
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:24,339
really is about being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to change</font>

706
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:27,699
what already exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this makes me</font>

707
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:31,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of the lean startup community so</font>

708
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:34,418
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that if we go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and validate</font>

709
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,369
that what we're building is in fact not

710
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:38,408
really what the world wants then we can

711
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,599
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it the software needs to</font>

712
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,760
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to change as the vision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

713
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,040
changes the idea that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

714
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,599
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> something without knowing</font>

715
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,300
exactly what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're building</font>

716
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:54,669
we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to start today and go</font>

717
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:57,129
as as fast as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can portability capable</font>

718
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:58,540
of being transported or conveyed this is

719
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:01,630
what I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when I thought of</font>

720
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,250
portable but that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

721
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very good example it is not a bad</font>

722
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,780
example but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example so</font>

723
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,240
the containerization that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

724
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,579
underwent in the transportation interest

725
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,040
industry is extraordinarily interesting

726
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:18,130
to me it happened right after World War

727
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">two the idea that we need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

728
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:27,369
move cargo on boats on rail on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

729
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:30,730
highways and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to to to</font>

730
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:34,450
have a standard across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> globe to do</font>

731
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:38,109
commerce with with internationally or

732
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,180
globally so containerization what does

733
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:42,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in the world today it's</font>

734
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,149
there's a lot of trend going towards

735
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:49,920
containerization in the cloud

736
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:52,609
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of being able to implement a</font>

737
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,680
system in more or less a black box and

738
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:58,440
while that hardware will continue to

739
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,390
degrade over time you can quickly grab

740
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,920
it and install it on a different

741
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">operating system in a different</font>

742
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,230
environment as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible with</font>

743
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,509
this low overhead as possible something

744
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:12,569
needs to be observable these are a

745
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,579
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attributes that that we added</font>

746
00:36:12,569 --> 00:36:22,470
here just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last six months or so</font>

747
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:24,150
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that software in order for</font>

748
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,950
it to be rugged you have to be able to

749
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,950
observe the health of it you can't just

750
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:34,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">launch it and and be blinded you can't</font>

751
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't really understand quantifiably</font>

752
00:36:34,529 --> 00:36:39,150
explain to your customer that things are

753
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going well are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that observability how do you</font>

755
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,849
know if you're being attacked if you

756
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,710
can't observe the health of your system

757
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:48,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that there there's a</font>

758
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,250
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

759
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,609
today if you're not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

760
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:56,549
like New Relic on your application break

761
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:59,759
man there's there's lots of options out

762
00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but observability is clearly in my</font>

763
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,549
mind required in order for software to

764
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:07,980
be rugged but you can't just be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

765
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:09,630
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you need to be able to control it</font>

766
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,789
i don't know if you notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> but in this I</font>

767
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,180
did I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found</font>

768
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:19,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that that didn't have any</font>

769
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:22,440
buttons and so here we have buttons the

770
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:25,140
ability to actually be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

771
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,680
the behavior of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software and so I</font>

772
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:32,490
liken this to configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> variables</font>

773
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:35,038
software needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to or i should</font>

774
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,660
say the stakeholders or owners or

775
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,369
developers or engineers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are working</font>

776
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,710
on software need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

777
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">the behavior of software without doing</font>

778
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,579
yet another code deploy as we all know

779
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:47,309
things can change when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you deploy a new</font>

780
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:52,260
code and so especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

781
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:54,150
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two week agile lifecycle and you</font>

782
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,890
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an issue in the system</font>

783
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,920
today you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

784
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:03,328
quickly so this is used

785
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,309
in larger situations in the cloud when

786
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,680
you have thousands of users and you want

787
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:09,240
to deploy a new feature before you

788
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,339
deploy it to everyone you want to make

789
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,770
it available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone whose last name</font>

790
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:15,690
starts with a and then make it available

791
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,390
to everyone whose last name is a B or C

792
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,740
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually scale it up and</font>

793
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,848
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for a lot of reasons</font>

794
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,040
you want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

795
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:24,630
put undue stress or load on your system

796
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,720
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that people like</font>

797
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,790
it etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you can do that with code</font>

798
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,098
deploys but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier if when</font>

799
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:35,099
you're developing it you're you're

800
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,390
pointing to environment variables or

801
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:38,490
configuration variables that are

802
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:42,569
adjusting the behavior that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramping</font>

803
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:44,459
feature five minutes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

804
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:47,040
almost done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here this is the other</font>

805
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,049
example of of controllability and

806
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,940
because i live in the software world<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

807
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:52,500
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

808
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you can quite tell i used this</font>

809
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,839
as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the apple TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

810
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:00,390
lot like a black box but as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm thinking</font>

811
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,420
about configuration variables for

812
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:06,180
software it occurred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that black</font>

813
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,980
box software can be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that same</font>

814
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,020
way and it's true with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phones</font>

815
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,010
that we have in our pockets right they

816
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:16,020
have settings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those settings can</font>

817
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:18,000
easily change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior of the</font>

818
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">software itself so just think of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

819
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,349
being yet another way to change the

820
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,380
behavior of your software without

821
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:28,589
actually having to release new code and

822
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,319
potentially break or damage and

823
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:32,730
experience so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving forward I think</font>

824
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:35,190
there's some additional areas that we

825
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,920
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at for rugged one of them is</font>

826
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,319
looking at whether or not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system is</font>

827
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,510
usable or accessible these weren't

828
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:45,240
originally part of the the thoughts

829
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,920
because for rugged because the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

830
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,828
rugged kind of came from the security

831
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,619
world I spend more of my time talking to

832
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:54,119
usability experts than I do security

833
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,680
experts and they have concerns about

834
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,900
whether or not something is usable or

835
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,759
accessible if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable or</font>

836
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,630
accessible it certainly will not be

837
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">available to some and so maybe these are</font>

838
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just contributing areas to to</font>

839
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,520
availability but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll suggest to you</font>

840
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:12,480
that maybe we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

841
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,369
adding another parent level

842
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:20,910
attribute something needs to be secure

843
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:26,700
reliable maintainable and usable so back

844
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:28,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Batman here's my call to you the idea</font>

845
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of rugged is is more than just a</font>

846
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,550
scientific project it's more than just

847
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,319
trying to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can build</font>

848
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:40,770
better software but it's actually

849
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:42,570
stepping up and doing it so I took

850
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,550
grabbed a couple of quotes from Batman

851
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,390
if you make yourself more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

852
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:54,690
man if you devote yourself to an ideal

853
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you become something else entirely but</font>

854
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,220
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just that it's not who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

855
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:02,700
underneath it's what you do that defines

856
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,410
you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the challenge it's not</font>

857
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to believe in something or to buy</font>

858
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this ideal but to actually</font>

859
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,990
challenge yourself and challenge those

860
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,670
who you work with to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and do it</font>

861
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:16,618
better so I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all you in terms</font>

862
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a call to action please visit rugged</font>

863
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:24,359
dev org there's our twitter account

864
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,310
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on on blogging more adding</font>

865
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:34,980
more to the content and we welcome

866
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:37,290
contributors so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much but</font>

867
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,940
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about like Ruby</font>

868
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:42,090
on Rails that there's a certain way to

869
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,820
build software and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll kind of all</font>

870
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,040
crowdsource that agreement or that

871
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,359
approach yeah so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

872
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,770
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be conditionally injectable</font>

873
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,660
right if you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

874
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you trust that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do you can</font>

875
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,250
be predictable anyone else maybe you

876
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,680
should be unpredictable<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

877
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:13,369
confuse them like on purpose

878
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:19,799
yeah measure abilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we measure</font>

879
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:23,490
softly 18 well so we've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

880
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:25,410
idea that as we work on rugged that may

881
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:27,720
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end result is once we can all</font>

882
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:29,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree on what it is that rugged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

883
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it affects the world that we live in</font>

884
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">the software that we work on that maybe</font>

885
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:37,589
it does become a framework and a scoring

886
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:40,380
system so that you can you can run your

887
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:42,450
system against this rugged protocol and

888
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,920
find out that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not rugged at all</font>

889
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,470
and you should start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working here</font>

890
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't it be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great if we had that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 440</font>

891
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,328
wasp right what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 we all</font>

892
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:53,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about we need to pick one of the</font>

893
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:54,900
OWASP top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and just start working on</font>

894
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:57,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one well which one do we start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

895
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:02,520
right yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you have</font>

896
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:05,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">to focus on on their pain and if they're</font>

897
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,288
if they've been developing for a while

898
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,619
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably have experienced enough</font>

899
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:13,799
pain working on systems that are highly

900
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,779
configured and highly bespoke so

901
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:18,599
incredibly different than anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

902
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:20,430
that there's a huge learning curve

903
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,049
involved and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

904
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,740
individual developer maybe it's the

905
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:27,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">product owner who then because of the</font>

906
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,970
normal nature of turnover with their

907
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:32,549
folks that every time they bring on

908
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:35,250
someone new it's it's weeks before they

909
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:39,538
really understand what it is that

910
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:41,910
they're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's almost like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

911
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,859
only way to really get anyone to believe

912
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,910
in rugged is to get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on</font>

913
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,869
their pains right all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

914
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:50,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone appreciate it</font>

915
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,250
you
