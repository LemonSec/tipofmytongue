00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,770
so my I a mere blue I live in Portland

2
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,300
Oregon we could take alternate titles of

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:31,448
elevations so I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> automator when</font>

i joined five years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's been</font>

5
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of admission ever since i started</font>

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's two you know automate as much as</font>

7
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:42,159
possible and make things consistent

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,829
repeatable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am i've been at a few</font>

9
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,960
different places was<font color="#E5E5E5"> at musician's</font>

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,760
e-commerce and warehouse unit support at

12
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,140
a company called<font color="#E5E5E5"> chalk stone that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,750
acquired<font color="#E5E5E5"> by her from payment systems</font>

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,580
very shortly<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the breach so that</font>

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:01,720
was exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one about after we got</font>

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:04,209
acquired like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys why</font>

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,240
do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this now vibration have been</font>

18
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for about five years now and we do</font>

for our mitigation through device

20
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,789
reputations so if you are a bank of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,400
dating site you can integrate us and you

people walking into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and use us</font>

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of attack like that my group does</font>

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,729
we managed all the production systems we

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,280
work all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps good but that's</font>

28
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of men oculus term you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your IT organization helps</font>

30
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,179
do things in a DevOps kind of way so we

31
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,429
change their names to service why the

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:45,370
reliability engineering so we're going

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about how do we assess risk with</font>

34
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,320
changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to make in our</font>

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,810
environment and so we had been older

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,330
methodology that was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font>

37
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,220
catching you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know issues with larger</font>

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,158
sets of change you know we'd go and make

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,048
a large database configuration change

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,510
where we go and do a large co deployment

41
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,770
and because of our system architecture

42
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,849
you know we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in at five in the</font>

43
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:11,859
morning doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work and testing the</font>

44
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:13,000
work and then going oh man<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I</font>

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,030
Mississippi because it's five in the

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,510
morning we're not quite awake yet things

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,819
along those lines and so those kind of

48
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,170
things we're kind of painful so you know

49
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,640
one of the other things that we did one

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,349
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did we've we do 12</font>

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,529
runs before we went to production so

52
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,670
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> inc you</font>

53
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,530
takes their machine that they've been

54
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing on uninstalls the new version</font>

55
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,870
reinstalls the old version say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,220
is how we take it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a production</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

57
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,720
we go and install the new stuff again

58
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,970
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the documentation that's</font>

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,830
been produced and then you know we spend

60
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,810
a bunch of time doing that we're always

61
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,370
I'm confident that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,100
environment as it is in production

63
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,170
because there are you know tens of

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,420
machines in some cases dozens of

65
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,640
machines so this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> always work</font>

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,920
well sometimes we had go dung co

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,079
meetings we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent about it</font>

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,700
they had varying levels of quality if

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,260
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other was driving them you know how</font>

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,140
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scope or the change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was things</font>

71
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that and one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

72
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,238
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked that had good good some</font>

73
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,488
good results was the thing we called the

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,970
ICL and it came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some folks that</font>

75
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:19,790
used to work at Intel and in Intel's big

76
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,850
fat plants they have huge risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> adverse</font>

77
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,829
you know mindsets because when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat</font>

78
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">down they stopped making money to the</font>

79
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,130
tunes of millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars an hour or</font>

80
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,980
whatever whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their their</font>

81
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">scale is so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we built these large</font>

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,000
spreadsheets these were more updated

83
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,799
versions they used to be Excel

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,049
spreadsheets on a window share that only

85
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,810
one person can<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit at a time it was</font>

86
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:47,570
really laborious and you'd have two or

87
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,790
three meetings before a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> event all</font>

88
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,950
sitting down and planning each step for

89
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,470
each part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process you know pre</font>

90
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,410
pre downtime work longley times before

91
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,690
that so on and so forth take a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">boombox made this a lot better but a</font>

93
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,420
spreadsheet is not a great way to track

94
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,650
a lot of the stuff especially when it

95
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,250
comes to reporting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it later to things</font>

96
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so this like I said especially</font>

97
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the pain we didn't have a lot of</font>

98
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,620
accountability for lower risk products

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,358
the smaller changes that seemed

100
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,459
innocuous sometimes ballooned into like

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,349
oh wow yeah that affected all outbound

102
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,750
mail now<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers are getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reports</font>

103
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:28,460
or you know other things along those

104
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,780
lines there was no feedback loop you

105
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">know people would go they make their</font>

106
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,380
changes and sometimes and went well and

107
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that seemed well in Houston why would</font>

108
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,349
you continue to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it after it</font>

109
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,090
was done but then other times it would

110
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:39,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Valley and we still talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

111
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're you know putting out fires</font>

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,460
on our heads or whatever else so trying

113
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,720
to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go from here you</font>

114
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,310
know we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to maintain our</font>

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,630
velocity we were a team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had built a</font>

116
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,460
reputation around actually getting

117
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,380
things done you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know getting things done</font>

118
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,190
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and trying to help enable</font>

119
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,229
business to do what we needed to do but

120
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,060
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve advocacy you know</font>

121
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,310
we had issue where you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd missed</font>

122
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,080
steps and that velocity would inevitably

123
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,919
come back to bite us because we would

124
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,060
miss things you know I'm responding to

125
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,109
the needs of the business is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

126
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,450
important obviously if you have a

127
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,150
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> facing security vulnerability</font>

128
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,430
or something that's broken and impacting

129
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,440
how customers are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> your system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

130
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,849
can cause a problem but then you know

131
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed to that could also</font>

132
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:30,380
introduced a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other risks that</font>

133
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be thinking about if you've</font>

134
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,380
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got like the one guy on call late</font>

135
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,979
at night trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce the effects of</font>

136
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,000
our biases so you know ignoring red

137
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:46,580
flags you know here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been at a</font>

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,570
planning meeting and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see all the</font>

139
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,650
signs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go wrong and</font>

140
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,909
you're you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a good</font>

141
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,020
time when it's time it's time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

142
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:56,599
actually implement it you know

143
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,789
everyone's kind of quiet all looking at

144
00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:03,020
each other like<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to say that</font>

145
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:05,390
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a good idea and dates is</font>

146
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,150
another one who's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a who's seen a</font>

147
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,940
property manager was oh

148
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,830
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> highs go ahead they kind of</font>

149
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,690
yeah they're they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with</font>

150
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that their schedule slipping</font>

151
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,310
the Gantt charts are all now and

152
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,710
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like rejigger the whole</font>

153
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,660
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that and that's a that's an</font>

154
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,460
important thing because you know we're

155
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">all incentivized by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you know</font>

156
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,599
scissors ends are traditionally

157
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,010
incentivized by up time developers are

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,780
instead of eyes be getting new features

159
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,490
in front of users faster project

160
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,840
managers are incentivized by dates so

161
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,020
everyone's trying to work towards their

162
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,960
incentives and that can that can affect

163
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,260
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you proceed progress so it's wrong</font>

164
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you reduce some of that providing more</font>

165
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,200
opportunities for for peer review<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

166
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,750
more visibility so you know making it

167
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,510
more obvious how we manage things in

168
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,380
operations as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as providing more</font>

169
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:02,719
avenues for input you know the

170
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,250
programmatic change control has made

171
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,620
this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better it's a lot easier to</font>

172
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,320
to do a code review of puppet instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

173
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,820
a spreadsheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're trying to like</font>

174
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,710
oh yeah i typed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the commands</font>

175
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">again here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's oh yeah it's not</font>

176
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,500
quite right because it changes machine

177
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:19,820
machine and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and</font>

178
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure we're running with the</font>

179
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,780
contractual requirements that we have as

180
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,760
a business you know our customers will

181
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,770
require us to descend certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

182
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,780
notice in some cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kinds of</font>

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,640
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we get</font>

held accountable for<font color="#E5E5E5"> so making sure that</font>

185
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:38,090
we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff into account too</font>

186
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,310
in addition to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own needs and what</font>

187
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:45,080
building one who here has a change

188
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:47,890
control board how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I don't</font>

189
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do with it directly</font>

190
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:58,810
how long do you think it works I think

191
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their cases over to me they may be</font>

192
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,220
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

193
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a big part of our organization that</font>

194
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,220
the traditional campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> change control</font>

195
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,979
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it turns into theater and</font>

196
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,420
politicking you know like oh hey you

197
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,740
know I know I can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and so and</font>

198
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,600
I'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this through you</font>

199
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,550
know we'll make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sound like it's not a</font>

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,580
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal we'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out we're going to</font>

201
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,230
know where it is cool really an article

202
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,900
about this from a judge humble about

203
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,290
risk management<font color="#CCCCCC"> theater so good good</font>

204
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,620
reference their crosses for the sake of

205
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,080
process is is another one that we're

206
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,780
sensitive to you know some organizations

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,010
they have a big failure and how they did

208
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,959
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then suddenly there's a</font>

209
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,760
new 30 page document from some guy who's

210
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,820
never actually done anything about how

211
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,530
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thing and it's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font>

212
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,960
okay it was skip that's good that's good

213
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,730
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that it doesn't get you know</font>

214
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,020
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the spirit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing gets</font>

215
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,170
followed because you're so put off by

216
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,290
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it in the first place the</font>

217
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,240
air<font color="#E5E5E5"> force action oh that's an excellent</font>

218
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,040
and then document documentation around

219
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,720
that in the same vein documentation that

220
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,150
you no one can actually use because it's

221
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,790
30 pages long<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> airports as an</font>

222
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,730
example as a risk management document

223
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,540
that's 31 pages long and talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

224
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:20,120
to assess risk or you know they're there

225
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">kerman and other things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it</font>

226
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,200
is a hard read<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually went through</font>

227
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,450
and tried to read it read it before I

228
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,630
was whoever I have had this talk put

229
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,910
together falling asleep it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

230
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,880
to make it through<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if your theory of</font>

231
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,699
that you might check it out but could be

232
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,470
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what not to do try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

233
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,420
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> single points of failure so we do</font>

234
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile in infrastructure because we</font>

235
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,579
we run active active data centers we and

236
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,699
we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cognizant about our</font>

237
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,170
availability model but we didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

238
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,570
introduce single points of failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

239
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,180
the human part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization so</font>

240
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,890
you know having one guy who's the the

241
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,989
ultimate center of what goes one doesn't

242
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,310
doesn't scale you know everyone goes on

243
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,779
vacation so we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

244
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're not</font>

245
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:06,519
like introducing a new single point of

246
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:11,829
failure in a person or in a negative

247
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,629
role and then a culture that puppy nah

248
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,370
we don't want to a culture that punishes

249
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:19,240
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so using it as an</font>

250
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,550
opportunity to improve you know it's

251
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,139
it's a tough tough thing when you talk

252
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,729
up and it's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> tougher if you know</font>

253
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a meeting where</font>

254
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get raked over the coals on it so</font>

255
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know encouraging folks to be able to</font>

256
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,430
say yes this happened we obviously was

257
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,769
wrong because you know we were down for

258
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,138
an hour or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's often</font>

259
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,120
obvious and often everyone knows why it

260
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,689
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm using its opportunity</font>

261
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,449
to do better<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

262
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:49,569
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> try in and get that so what I try to</font>

263
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:51,939
do here is kind of walk through<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

264
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,740
ended up implementing for our change

265
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,599
control process and kind of do a

266
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level overview of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effort</font>

267
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,540
thought process behind the methodology

268
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,610
so one of the biggest things that we

269
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,529
want to do with this is use it as an

270
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,740
opportunity to educate others on how to

271
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,240
assess risk so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to like</font>

272
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,610
I generally when I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make a</font>

273
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,689
funnel for all this this risk assessment

274
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,430
to go through we're trying to educate

275
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:17,230
others on things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cognizant up as</font>

276
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're as they're doing their work</font>

277
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,639
because everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> opting out and a</font>

278
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology organization is working on</font>

279
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">set that it inevitably makes it to</font>

280
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,128
production and then in turn they have to

281
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:28,509
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about what's the bigger</font>

282
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:33,370
impact of what I'm working on and how

283
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:34,779
might that add some risk so some of the

284
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,240
key considerations the two key

285
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,750
considerations about risk for us or

286
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,939
business impact whether its financial

287
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,829
customer reputation things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or</font>

288
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:47,920
whether its complexity you know number

289
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">of moving parts impacts you know or</font>

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,639
impacts to the components being touched

291
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,420
or the components<font color="#CCCCCC"> that touch those</font>

292
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:58,240
components and it ended up looking

293
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,949
something like this so trying to dumb it

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,040
down into something

295
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,880
festival and use a bit for folks without

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,420
having to agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 one-page document</font>

297
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,610
so goes from lowest to highest risk you

298
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,400
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bruce is 31 is there's not a score</font>

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,480

trying to make again trying to keep it

301
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:25,060
simple obviously if you have a single

302
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:28,330
change to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low risk system you know if</font>

325
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,910
years ago there was a big sporting event

326
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,620
in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea more like pile</font>

327
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,790
traffic is really high I'm wonder what's

328
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,140
going on that we looked at someone

329
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,360
happen to notice in the news that

330
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,939
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big event going on here in the</font>

then since<font color="#CCCCCC"> it around production outages</font>

333
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,710
so entities can measure by third parties

334
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:44,079
and if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had a bad month you</font>

just internet wonkiness or other things

337
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,200
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that we're</font>

338
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,569
sensitive about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets reported</font>

339
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,970
since those reports go to our customers

340
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,260
we don't get to influence them so we're

341
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,670
definitely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hook for those kinds</font>

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,410
of things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then how you has the</font>

344
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,529
you know if this is a change that we've

345
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,509
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred times before we've gotten</font>

346
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,649
out of science it's a lot less risky

347
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:11,769
than something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would try it for the</font>

348
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,970
first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know because we're in</font>

services they don't have complexity some

352
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,149
of the things you know change scope

353
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,040
matters a lot here if you have potential

354
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:26,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to knock all your customer transactions</font>

357
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,269
pretty non-complex something we have

358
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:36,758
done a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times before automation</font>

helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive complexity down because it's</font>

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,949
allowing you to express the things that

361
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,930
are going on through code you know if if

362
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:46,000
you've got a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tested automation</font>

363
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,729
scripts that do the work and have been

tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they were run a production</font>

365
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:54,459
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge win from from a complexity</font>

366
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:56,529
standpoint because you're able to do it

367
00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:01,719
and do it the same way over and over

370
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,769
have a service oriented architecture

371
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,769
that drives most of our real time

372
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,079
services and occasionally weekend

373
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:12,939
situations were two of those services

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,469
bought a be updated in lockstep and

375
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:16,930
recently we actually had a situation

376
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,740
where we upgraded it<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

377
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:23,258
had rolled back<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad fix that</font>

378
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">as you roll the forward and roll back</font>

379
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:29,889
again and each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these deployments and</font>

380
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:34,029
roll backs is across you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dozen</font>

381
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:36,250
servers across two data centers and it's

382
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,829
a manual orchestration at this point so

383
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,939
it's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy work and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

really tedious and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned you</font>

390
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:57,070
know if you don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> robot process</font>

391
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,600
you gotta fix forward and

392
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,980
was that look like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> made this</font>

394
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:08,920
up is there anyone who can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

engaged and fix this you know brand new

tasks that we have we assess as a group

<font color="#E5E5E5">so you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is something like a</font>

400
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of meetings and talk about</font>

production huh you know how we plan to

403
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,750
bring it online without impacting other

404
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,840
services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that matters those</font>

405
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,580
kinds of things so they thoughtful of

406
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,930
that and losing people in from outside

407
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,820
of the group that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it</font>

408
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,459
for the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,870
got that that blinders on that says I've

410
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,730
got to cut this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing out got to get it</font>

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">done name on a book might not have been</font>

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,720
thinking about some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

414
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,350
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change to go for example of</font>

415
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,710
that meeting where everyone's kind of

416
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,720
glazed over I mean how often does that

417
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,780
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> working like what what this is</font>

418
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,580
done how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like when will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

know that we've succeeded now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

420
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,180
these change sets make it really large

421
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,619
and ambiguous like what how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

422
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,320
measure that the thing that we're doing

423
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:18,280
is actually done and that it has

424
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:19,958
succeeded calling out that there's a big

<font color="#CCCCCC">difference between planes and unplayed</font>

426
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,480
work it's also important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

427
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">plane work is stuff that you don't want</font>

428
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,260
before unplanned work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

429
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">frantic troubleshooting it two in the</font>

430
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,350
morning trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out why you</font>

431
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">know everything takes two seconds to</font>

432
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:38,949
respond so yeah everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is</font>

433
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,080
unplanned you know we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of a recipe for gets called out it's</font>

435
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this is automatically a step higher</font>

436
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,350
because you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently in it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

437
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that's kind of why we have the</font>

438
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,639
quality people that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

439
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,219
welcome to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respond at the</font>

440
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,840
moment but that's it automatically

441
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,170
becomes more risky because you're kind

442
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">of winging it</font>

443
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,639
so kinds of changes so you know

444
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,490
emergency changes have to be accounted

445
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,310
for because if you have to you know

446
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,870
adhere to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tedious change</font>

447
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,399
control process where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call</font>

448
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,810
for people before you can even log into

449
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,290
production that's not going to help you

450
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it as always you know making sure</font>

451
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,750
that you've brought the communicated

452
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,429
that there's an emergency and that

453
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,900
people need to be aware of it clearly

454
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,200
communicating in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency is over</font>

455
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,610
is is also important nothing like coming

456
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,850
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> office</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and exhale i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

457
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:36,830
skillet this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a problem probably</font>

458
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:43,050
go oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry we fix that it like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

459
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:45,449
yeah exactly exactly making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

460
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,250
you documented the<font color="#E5E5E5"> death of us problem</font>

461
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,080
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution was and that you've</font>

462
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,210
got a play by play we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> hipchat for</font>

463
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,830
this they have we called the deployment

464
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,560
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a production</font>

465
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,360
change room every deployment that we do

466
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,460
every big production changeover you gets

467
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,379
called out play by play<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that room</font>

468
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,810
like hey I'm deploying on this server

469
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,910
now and then someone from QA goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

470
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,960
and then we go a QA person would creep

471
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">test validate that this looks sane and</font>

472
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,010
that also you need time stamps which is

473
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,350
huge when it's like two days later or

474
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,330
like the Monday after a weekend issue

475
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,540
and they're like what when did I change

476
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,300
that config and like we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it get</font>

477
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">better go back to the grass go back to</font>

478
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,050
the hip chat room got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lot more</font>

479
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">meta data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around your stuff at that</font>

480
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">point so how this changes so we're</font>

481
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,560
assessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it easy and we would we</font>

482
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,840
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do we fix forward a</font>

483
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,340
rollback they're both viable options we

484
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,560
just have to understand the pros and

485
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">cons to each you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think in a lot</font>

486
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,000
of cases we prefer to fix forward but it

487
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,929
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easier to roll back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,940
something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

489
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,790
we have cross game reviews so they're

490
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,260
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> point about this like recent as I</font>

491
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,810
mentioned before Cassandra update that

492
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,700
we did we were really formal went

493
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,490
through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

494
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the toilet folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from development QA and</font>

495
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SOE team better to talk about the</font>

496
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,969
process in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure everyone</font>

497
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:15,289
was on board and understood what was

498
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,880
going on we got approval from from a

499
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:19,580
director for that so you know making

500
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,769
sure both that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they have chance</font>

501
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,870
to see what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and say like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

502
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">it seemed sane as well as making sure</font>

503
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,510
that there's an awareness through the

504
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,519
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big change</font>

505
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,100
in the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

506
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:33,320
upgrade took weeks because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day of</font>

507
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,029
shuffling except that s go on so there's

508
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,039
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moving pieces and parts that</font>

509
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:38,120
had to be accounted for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as something</font>

510
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wanna be cognizant of</font>

511
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,918
because not everything else and the

512
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:47,389
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped at that point one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

513
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,830
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did to replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

514
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,559
see elsewhere sheep as we switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

515
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,939
using Trello for that so when if you're

516
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,610
not familiar with Trello it's basically

517
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,700
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> freeform web application where</font>

518
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,168
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cars and add elements to</font>

519
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,380
cards in the elements we like the most

520
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:06,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">or of the check boxes so we will have in</font>

521
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,570
the Kazan example again we have a check

522
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:10,220
box for each host and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of</font>

523
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,408
operations that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

524
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,389
host in order and then how does someone

525
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:16,130
makes those changes they check off each

526
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:17,870
box so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you come back the next</font>

527
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,120
day you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused about where you</font>

528
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,889
were in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know what</font>

529
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,959
stuff is outstanding it's especially

530
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">good in situations where there's more</font>

531
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,039
than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person making changes in</font>

532
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,899
the environment because it's it's a real

533
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,039
time I check a box on my machine you

534
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:33,199
almost immediately see it up near

535
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,789
machine so it gives you a good real-time

536
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,740
feedback view we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shared google</font>

537
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,620
calendar called the deployment calendar

538
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,090
every production deployment gets in a

539
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,879
bit on the calendar is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an all day event</font>

540
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day other changes make it there</font>

541
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,750
two good examples are network folks use

542
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,779
it a lot like hey we're changing

543
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,789
firewalls be aware provides visibility

544
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bolton technology and to our client</font>

545
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,230
services folks who can get you know get

546
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,539
calls and questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's going</font>

547
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:07,460
on the 12 border yeah I again very

548
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:09,879
detailed every step gets documented in

549
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,100
there we review<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

550
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,330
that it's all there and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeping it</font>

551
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,330
up-to-date as we go through the process

552
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,300
communicating<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and</font>

553
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRS change scenario again making sure</font>

554
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,810
that that client services group knows

555
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,360
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that there's</font>

556
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:27,250
things underway a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it</font>

557
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,560
doesn't matter it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of extra</font>

558
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,180
noise but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some times when you</font>

559
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,950
know the change is a new API that we're

560
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,930
having or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

561
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:39,040
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know so they can be where</font>

562
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:40,810
product needed things to customers again

563
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,580
we do sell myself announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

564
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,260
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes occur even with the Trello</font>

565
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,840
board we still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call out those</font>

566
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,879
things so we have a succinct timestamp

567
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,169
and a map of what happened with long

568
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,510
deployments will actually build the new

569
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,590
hip chat room and and say hey if you

570
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,720
curious about the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this thing</font>

571
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,179
come over this room it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

572
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,710
there's a history when the work is done

573
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:06,130
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just aren't have the room then you</font>

574
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:08,080
can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and surgeon later and then a</font>

575
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,470
retrospective so going through after the

576
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact and making sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've covered</font>

577
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,340
anything that it might need to improve

578
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,780
things that things I didn't go well

579
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,720
especially to make sure that we can

580
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn from it the next time so just</font>

581
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure we close that loop even the</font>

582
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,490
things go well we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> often learn</font>

583
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,990
something from it like oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

584
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,550
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because eliminated</font>

585
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:32,560
you know half the mat office or

586
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that so medium</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stages</font>

587
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,590
similar set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things just a little more</font>

588
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,790
limited a little little more free form

589
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,990
because we don't want to see whether one

590
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:47,620
down you know again fix Porter<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix fat</font>

591
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,480
or downgrade we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't require a cross</font>

592
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,860
game with you hear you say hey if you

593
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">peer review it with someone else on the</font>

594
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,409
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's reasonable you know you the</font>

595
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,930
medium risk you know implies that you

596
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,000
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to impact our data centers</font>

00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,950
for example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know cause a huge</font>

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">service outage</font>

599
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:09,350
approval this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solar park for me or</font>

600
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather directors or the CTO you know we</font>

601
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,519
have a decent approval chain so it's not

602
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:15,169
like it's just hung out on me waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

603
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,789
say yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is reasonable you know</font>

604
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:21,070
other other folks in the organization

605
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:23,649
can say yeah this seems like it's a go

606
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:25,939
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do is a</font>

607
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:28,129
control to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> pudding for hours rather</font>

608
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,929
than working getting so<font color="#E5E5E5"> although</font>

609
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:31,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">software deployments are this way we</font>

610
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,080
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's been in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there for 24</font>

611
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,490
hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that includes the</font>

612
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,590
documentation for the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

613
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,659
be done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an opportunity for</font>

614
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,189
us to check it out review it you know

615
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:42,440
utilize it for a while let it<font color="#E5E5E5"> percolate</font>

616
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:44,360
because they're not last minute okay

617
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,789
just finish the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box let's roll it you</font>

618
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,740
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns into it turns into paint</font>

619
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:52,639
sometimes so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and avoid</font>

620
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,679
that and then you know a lot of the

621
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:59,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">other stuff is the same you know step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

622
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:02,690
seven inch at deployment calendar<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

623
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,210
and then low risk is pretty free form

624
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,240
because we don't want to have a big you

625
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,799
know big slow down so we will do a

626
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,539
entertain with you if it is a

627
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,249
undocumented process so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

628
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,610
first time you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain kind</font>

629
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:17,690
of fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the first time you're doing</font>

630
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,490
you know a certain kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of configuration</font>

631
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,929
change we haven't toggle that flag

632
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,629
before have someone else peer-reviewed

633
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:28,460
make sure that it seems like you've got

634
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:31,539
your your head screwed on straight so

635
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:36,289
here's a practical example you've got a

636
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:38,299
DNS record for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a low bounce pull anyone</font>

637
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,879
update that in itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty low</font>

638
00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,710
risk task you know you're just updating

639
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:46,100
the the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the record</font>

640
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,409
updating the DNS zones young serial code

641
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:52,459
and saving with change reloading fine

642
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:54,379
that's easy easy but because you know

643
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,149
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 customer facing services</font>

644
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:57,469
they use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little balancing pool you</font>

645
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:59,360
might want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

646
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,960
someone that the saying yeah you you

647
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,309
spelled so quickly orale

648
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,309
directly in our case a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the time</font>

649
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,750
so so in this case it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's immediate</font>

650
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,159
risk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a stop the</font>

651
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,480
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the troubles before it</font>

652
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,490
but we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that someone</font>

653
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:20,230
has had a chance to you know Santa a

654
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:22,419
check thanks and here's one that is a

655
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,100
lockstep service upgrade so you know

656
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,950
high complexity because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're manually</font>

657
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,199
updating notes we're deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

658
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,399
in some cases we're deploying that so

659
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,260
the changes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> puppet but in other</font>

660
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,629
cases we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> built that that tooling</font>

661
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,279
yet so it's a manual upgrade of the

662
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,779
package<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's manual update to the</font>

663
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,250
configuration files and validating that

664
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,570
all the configuration files still look

665
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before we upgraded the</font>

666
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,889
service those kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> well back</font>

667
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,539
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as complex because you're just</font>

668
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,210
doing the same stuff in reverse put a

669
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:52,149
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> version and it could be a big</font>

670
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,770
impact because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's customer facing and</font>

671
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:55,570
you know that big thing customer of

672
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:59,260
yours is calling it five times a second

673
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,178
at least so this one is a lot so we

674
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,610
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be calling that out step by step</font>

675
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,710
in a trouble board documenting it out as

676
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,000
we go and hit yet there's opportunities

677
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,610
to automate some of that stuff to you

678
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,590
know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few baht baht for</font>

679
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">for HipChat know if you guys have put a</font>

680
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,299
few bought it set to<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript chatbot</font>

681
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,070
basically that can use any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

682
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:20,110
things as inputs so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build one</font>

683
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,980
that latches in the trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> API drops a</font>

684
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,840
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit chattin up every time</font>

685
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,250
someone's check something so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

686
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,919
you know that's ways you can improve

687
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:31,900
this stuff wow this just glue so

688
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,830
so what kind of fast ions the end of the

689
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:41,770
day you're all ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more beer or so</font>

690
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:46,330
any questions butts comments anything to

691
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:49,840
comments great job<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 comments like</font>

692
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:52,770
the talk of the reviewing those

693
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,240
high-risk all seems a lot of our

694
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,820
organizations we've had good people a

695
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,820
good technical managers who technical

696
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,649
directors their where they are a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

697
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,659
them have done that dawn

698
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:10,390
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience hunger resistance</font>

699
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:13,060
evaluate risk definitely have a lot of

700
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,840
insight<font color="#E5E5E5"> into things we come party yeah</font>

701
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:20,290
that's good and the second thing is the

702
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,439
retrospective good bad you know we can't

703
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,809
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in such a hurry roll to next and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>
