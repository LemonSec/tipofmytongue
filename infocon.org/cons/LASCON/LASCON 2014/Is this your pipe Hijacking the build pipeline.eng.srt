1
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,660
my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greg Anderson and my</font>

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,060
presentation is on compromising and

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">hijacking build pipelines I had a</font>

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,700
co-presenter named Kyle Kelly who

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,770
unfortunately couldn't make it today so

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,239
y'all are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stuck with me when I talk</font>

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">about build pipelines what I'm referring</font>

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,699
to is source control continuous

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,840
integration tools such as Travis and

10
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:46,620
Jake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and CI and upstream sources such as</font>

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,150
like pi PI the the ideal that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,790
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell you on by the end of the</font>

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,430
presentation is that rather than

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,980
focusing on an individual server if you

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,620
can contaminate the right pipeline you

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,968
will compromise a whole lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,519
without a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort so this</font>

18
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,500
talk is also about people making little

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,570
mistakes that we will maximize the

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,660
taking something very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doing</font>

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,179
the most damage possible with it and it

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,610
happens a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> often than I thought</font>

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,850
it would be and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just people</font>

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,670
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are new to development if you're</font>

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,009
familiar with rich mogul he does<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPSEC</font>

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,679
training at<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat USA and to read</font>

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,080
riches quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not completely scrub</font>

28
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:36,060
my code before posting to github I did

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,740
not have billing alerts enabled this was

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,740
a real mistake and I paid the price for

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complacency so essentially what rich</font>

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,740
did is he committed his<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon access</font>

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,979
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> to github someone came along and</font>

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,339
found this key spun up a whole bunch of

35
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,860
cloud servers on his account and in the

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,920
post mortem he found out that these

37
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,920
people were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> his cloud account and</font>

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,360
billing to mine bitcoin so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:10,140
one likes paying for other people's

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,970
cryptocurrency yeah that's not good if

41
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,429
you want to learn more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about riches</font>

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:18,209
story you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can visit this short URL that</font>

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I created but um I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

44
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,050
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the development environment</font>

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,540
that we work in and today we're all

46
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,670
about meeting deadlines and getting

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,429
things out before our competitors so

48
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,750
what happens in a rush<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy code is</font>

49
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,890
either

50
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,450
developers add things to the

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,920
repositories that shouldn't be there or

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,769
developers blindly trust a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,850
application to do a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them without</font>

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:46,860
looking through the source code so some

55
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,989
fun you can have when these credentials

56
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,390
get leaked specifically crowd cloud

57
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,280
credentials is you can create and

58
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,130
destroy infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,420
redistribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and load balancers you</font>

60
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:03,690
can move on sensitive volumes and in

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,200
Nova for OpenStack you can append a

62
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:12,320
malicious SSH key to all cloud servers

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,869
that are created after you add that key

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,590
so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is kind of how do</font>

65
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,540
we find these keys it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really pretty</font>

66
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,930
simple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either use google or</font>

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,880
github code search I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use google</font>

68
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,739
for finding actual files that people

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,850
have committed so um all I do is I use I

70
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,459
use like the the site delineation and

71
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,100
i'm searching github for the secret

72
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,130
token file which in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruby is used to</font>

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,570
store sensitive app sensitive

74
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,720
credentials that your application<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font>

75
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run and then in the second one I'm</font>

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,400
searching for RSA private keys and you

77
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,760
can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a fair amount of</font>

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,970
results one of my favorite ones is

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,399
because I don't work for Amazon is a ki

80
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:09,060
jai it's the prefix for all amazon

81
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,799
access keys so if you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these there's</font>

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high chance that it's not a</font>

83
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,329
false positive and you can log into

84
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,238
individual amazon accounts using this

85
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:22,650
prefix github wised up to this and has

86
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,260
changed this so since I I did to talk

87
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar at Def Con</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and since then</font>

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,419
they've done some additional filtering

89
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,710
on specifically this keyword so if you

90
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,419
search for this now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't get any</font>

91
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,430
results that's okay because there's

92
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,030
still a whole lot more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can search</font>

93
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,020
for another great one is OS password

94
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,340
which is short for<font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenStack password so</font>

95
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,010
if you wanted to compromise

96
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,880
cloud servers on IBM HP or Rackspace

97
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,099
this is probably what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">search for another one that I found</font>

99
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,180
interesting is API key there's a whole

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,760
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of false positives but I also got</font>

101
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,300
some really interesting results from

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,820
digging through this but my favorite is

103
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,729
github token because if you get one of

104
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,630
these you can masquerade as a developer

105
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:15,090
through all of their repositories so now

106
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,580
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these keys right ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

107
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:22,080
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised thousands of servers</font>

108
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:25,859
and do horrible things on them how many

109
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,590
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here use AWS anyone know one</font>

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,169
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's say you're all</font>

111
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,869
excited and you want to use this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

112
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,940
access key prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunt down and start</font>

113
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,500
doing things right this second I don't

114
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,219
see any laptops opening which is good

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,440
but you might go to the AWS login page

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,169
and you'll be oh man<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have this key but</font>

117
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,300
but where the hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go what you</font>

118
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,219
actually have to do is use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and</font>

119
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,139
it's kind of an extensive process to

120
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,240
compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your first server so</font>

121
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,240
essentially what you have to do is first

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,410
using the access key create a key pair

123
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,990
add it to your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> server then freeze</font>

124
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,090
the server you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise</font>

125
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,430
unmount the volume attach that unmounted

126
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,679
volume to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your server add your private</font>

127
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:15,150
key remount the volume to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your original</font>

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,940
server and then you can unfreeze it so

129
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,690
that's like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say but it's super</font>

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,160
easy to script the problem though is

131
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,240
since this has been going on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

132
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:30,450
some time amazon has wised up and really

133
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,060
stepped up their monitoring so if you

134
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,979
freeze a production server the developer

135
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to know instantly so if you</font>

136
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to smash and grab a whole lot</font>

137
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:40,409
of stuff this is great but<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly</font>

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,979
there's a lot better things that you can

139
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,210
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it which leads us to targeting</font>

140
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:50,940
CI tools so um does anyone use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins</font>

141
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,159
or continuous integration tools awesome

142
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what Jenkins</font>

143
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,300
is it's a continuous integration and

144
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,400
deployment tool used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

145
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,800
only test code but also to deploy it and

146
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,508
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to compromise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins</font>

147
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,000
is because it's essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road to</font>

148
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:09,419
production at the end of every Jenkins

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,180
instance is either a code repository

150
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,639
being used by multiple servers or a

151
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,000
production server with information we're

152
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,759
stealing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what a typical</font>

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,680
Jenkins build looks like we have a code

154
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,139
repository that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes through smoke and</font>

155
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,970
regression testing and then if both the

156
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,960
Suites pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's then deployed to</font>

157
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,539
production so essentially what we want

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,789
to do is masquerade as hipster developer

159
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:39,659
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise whatever is at the</font>

160
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:42,568
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this pipeline so let's say that</font>

161
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">hipster developer makes an oops and he</font>

162
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:48,659
commits his github token into a public

163
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,580
repository<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I find I mean it's</font>

164
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,440
pretty much off to the races you can be

165
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,940
as creative as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want with the</font>

166
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,729
vulnerability that you put in his code

167
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,469
but in the first scenario when there's

168
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,560
just a code repository you're infecting

169
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:04,050
you want something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is easy to</font>

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,779
detect and scan for but is also easy to

171
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,599
use so i think buffer overflow would be

172
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:13,169
like my choice but again it's up to you

173
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your creativity if it's a production</font>

174
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,490
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think more about persistence i</font>

175
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,770
think about reverse shells to try and

176
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:24,930
bypass firewalls and exfiltrate

177
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,609
information so how credentials and

178
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,629
secrets are actually stored in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jenkins</font>

179
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:34,020
is either through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual deploy</font>

180
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,479
script or the credentials plugin but at

181
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,669
runtime it doesn't matter because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

182
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,760
all are passed as environment variables

183
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,730
so the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

184
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,689
potentially hijacked code is an attempt

185
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,260
to phone home the environment variables

186
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:55,829
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without any</font>

187
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,839
problems so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

188
00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will give me one of the servers</font>

189
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our continuous integration tools</font>

190
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,339
are potentially interacting with but

191
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,349
like compromising one server is kind of

192
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,120
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's nothing exciting</font>

193
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,860
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it every day what's really</font>

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool is you know</font>

195
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,080
compromising all the servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

196
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,910
piece of technology is connected to so

197
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,900
in order to do that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to try to</font>

198
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,969
target Jenkins directly so um I did a

199
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,939
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of digging more digging than I</font>

200
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,580
want to admit and if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

201
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:32,340
Jenkins user database all your users are

202
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,770
managed in this directory called VAR lib

203
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jenkins users and each user has a</font>

204
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,030
configuration file that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

205
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,490
if you can't really see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's a</font>

206
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:47,400
password hash that's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> JV crypt so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

207
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,650
did some more digging and I dug down to

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this file called hudson private security</font>

209
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,770
realm where we learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> jenkins is</font>

210
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,689
encoding passwords and how it validates

211
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:02,850
them the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's not really a</font>

212
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem but it's very easy for me to</font>

213
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,820
create hashes that would be validated by

214
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:12,510
this piece of techno this piece of

215
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,360
technology so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to</font>

216
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">try is what if something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was</font>

217
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,280
maliciously entered into the code the

218
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,930
goal of this code is to enumerate all

219
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:27,180
the users that are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins</font>

220
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,910
database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then change their password</font>

221
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,890
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my choice so that I can</font>

222
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:39,930
log in as anyone and then dump all the

223
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:42,420
credentials let's give it a try so over

224
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my potential code that i</font>

225
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,699
have now access to from compromising the

226
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,650
github token and to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

227
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,920
cheating I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to pick a</font>

228
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,920
password be brave

229
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:05,280
sure sparkles<font color="#E5E5E5"> I definitely did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not make</font>

230
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,280
my password sparkles to start with right

231
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,020
so now we have our bcrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash that we</font>

232
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,020
can attempt to pass through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pipeline</font>

233
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,170
Oh

234
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:03,100
cool so um up until this point oh I

235
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:06,870
didn't start it<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start my</font>

236
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,870
militia server so i can get data back

237
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,480
cool so up until this point I don't

238
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually know where the Jenkins server</font>

239
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,510
is but you'll see it's doing this

240
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,529
potential build over here and it's

241
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:50,050
running through my code and at the same

242
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,770
time you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in our malicious server</font>

243
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:57,699
we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> received an IP address and</font>

244
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:00,630
three users so I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick</font>

245
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,630
admin because I'm lazy

246
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,060
maybe

247
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh scared me for a second and skittles</font>

248
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:32,769
sparkles and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have full access</font>

249
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,529
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins box which after this is</font>

250
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,239
kind of arbitrarily easy to dump all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

251
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,879
credentials not just for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

252
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:41,709
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is connected to and at</font>

253
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:45,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point you're you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're home</font>

254
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:49,868
free um so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of a catch</font>

255
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:52,360
though to this attack vector and it's

256
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,970
that it has to run on the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> master</font>

257
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,589
node of Jenkins which most people are

258
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,749
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because these</font>

259
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:03,759
builds are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of costly so if they're</font>

260
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,949
not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on multiple nodes this is</font>

261
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,189
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default but if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a</font>

262
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,229
huge deploy and they are they do have

263
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:13,629
slave nodes there is ways to force

264
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,709
yourself to the master to cause this

265
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:20,980
attack to<font color="#CCCCCC"> execute and compromise the the</font>

266
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:23,018
Jenkins server and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do</font>

267
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,119
that is if they allow concurrent builds

268
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,549
to execute all you have to do is add a

269
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:29,410
sleep function in the malicious code so

270
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:32,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep recommitting and pushing</font>

271
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:35,319
this code and it makes each node sleep

272
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:39,369
each slave<font color="#E5E5E5"> node sleep until you're on</font>

273
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,660
the master node if they don't allow

274
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,420
concurrent builds you have to get a

275
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:47,920
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit creative so your options are</font>

276
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,389
to monitor for other commits that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

277
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">being pushed and other jobs that are</font>

278
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">being built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can try to land on</font>

279
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,009
the master so essentially you're just

280
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,399
trying to land on like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bull's-eye you</font>

281
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:59,199
know it's like playing darts or with the

282
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,600
compromised credentials that you have

283
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,019
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can push to other repositories and</font>

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,059
try to trigger builds concurrently that

285
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,879
will allow your malicious code to

286
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:12,069
propagate but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there aren't any</font>

287
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,379
like security oopsis what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font>

288
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,329
want to compromise repository because we

289
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:19,929
know a thousand people use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font>

290
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:22,449
hundred thousand people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and or at</font>

292
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:28,628
with information that'll get us halfway

293
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:30,519
to buying our own yacht in some cases

building and essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that does</font>

297
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:37,689
is Jenkins will take the pull request

298
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:40,269
automatically run the code to see if

299
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,919
it's functional and if it passes

300
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,109
performance standards and then it will

301
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,389
report that information to the admin so

302
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds kind of stupid to us as</font>

this comment saying can one of the

312
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:15,039
admins verify this patch before the code

313
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:18,039
is even run so pressing forward you have

314
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,069
two options on being sneaky is nothing

315
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">really new you have to either obfuscate</font>

316
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,468
your code in a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the malicious</font>

319
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:35,739
undetected a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of that is it</font>

320
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,509
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as simple as yank paste which if</font>

321
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:42,099
you use vim copies and pastes a line

322
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:44,349
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the old code for iOS verify ssl</font>

323
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:46,749
certificates and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice there is</font>

324
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:52,779
an extra go to fail which causes it to

325
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:55,089
fail every time so there's also this

326
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:58,449
notion of just forcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenkins to build</font>

327
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,279
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it is doing is waiting for a</font>

328
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,689
post request that says hey there's new

329
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,689
code that you need to test and

330
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:09,100
supposedly Jenkins verifies that there's

331
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a new pull request that's</font>

332
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:15,609
legitimate and authenticated by an admin

333
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,069
but it all it it's literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a post</font>

334
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:20,408
request if you can forge it you can

335
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,509
force any instance to build regardless

336
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:24,669
of their settings this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I</font>

337
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,618
wanted to do more research on but I went

338
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,360
to Hawaii and I discovered that I like

339
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:31,330
my tie is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I like research so</font>

340
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:33,879
um if anyone plays with this I'd love to

341
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,939
hear from you if not maybe I'll get some

342
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:38,590
free time but the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> case scenario</font>

343
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,529
right is even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not using</font>

344
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,449
continuous integration tools you just

345
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,890
commit something small that could be

346
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,440
malicious and you wait and you

347
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it propagates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it does you go you</font>

348
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,550
scan for it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you compromise every</font>

349
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,570
single server that gets touched by the

350
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:58,659
code but um so I put a quick overview on

351
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,929
things you should do to secure your CI

352
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,670
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> disable anonymous access gate your</font>

353
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,920
deploys use random port for slave

354
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,870
communications disabled executor is on

355
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,860
master change your<font color="#E5E5E5"> web hook from the</font>

356
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,570
default URL it's that easy but one

357
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,750
question that kind of came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> when me</font>

358
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,689
and Kyle we're doing Kyle and I we're

359
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,700
doing this research is um can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

360
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">let people know when they screw up and</font>

361
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,930
it turns out there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

362
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,860
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that but they don't do it</font>

363
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">very well so um this is an email that</font>

364
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">some security researcher sent out and</font>

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,720
you'll notice basically he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we've</font>

366
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,729
confirmed this exploit manually and then

367
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,110
you look down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is clearly not</font>

368
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:46,060
something that's being leaked so Kyle

369
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:49,439
started this project called get segni

370
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,360
its job is to search repositories for

371
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,190
security oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> ha's email the original</font>

372
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,629
committer and owner of the project let

373
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,410
them know how to revoke keys and then

374
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,750
panic um the responses were kind of

375
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,340
varied some people were really thankful

376
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,470
and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how we actually</font>

377
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,939
found these issues other people were

378
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,610
like well as the testing project so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

379
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care but you know there's not</font>

380
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:16,060
really such things as like testing

381
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:18,310
credit cards so still useful for me I

382
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,139
don't even own this repository or

383
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:24,669
doesn't matter i'm not using the account

384
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:28,980
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far we've done last time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font>

385
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:33,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kyle he's verified and notified 265</font>

386
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,640
people of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys we found that's not</font>

387
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:38,649
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a lot of keys um that's all</font>

388
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,350
that I got man there's there's so many

389
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,810
out there like people like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

390
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">how cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 days are and all that but if</font>

391
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,370
you if you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google right now and</font>

392
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,810
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> starts start searching or if you go</font>

393
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,040
to github and just start using code

394
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:55,360
search man like you'll you'll be set for

395
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,629
days you will never need another

396
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:06,639
computer for as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are coding</font>

397
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:08,320
I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to it maybe maybe yeah so the</font>

398
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,530
numbers are pretty astonishing like so

399
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,679
for secret token in Ruby 3,400 hits

400
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,480
those are going to be I would guess few

401
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,980
false positives because it is an actual

402
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,410
file that they're committing you can't

403
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have like a false secret file on</font>

404
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,430
thousand amazon servers oh yeah so

405
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,649
github and<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon have gotten a lot</font>

406
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,200
smarter about this github is trying to

407
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:35,290
no longer index possible secrets so

408
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,850
their goal is whenever you actually use

409
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,399
code search you won't get any results

410
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,959
back so they're definitely getting

411
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,250
smarter amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

412
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,260
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

413
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,880
are actively scanning and notifying

414
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,040
their customers so it's definitely

415
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,750
trending down but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

416
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,389
trending down because our practices are

417
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:55,290
getting smarter I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're just</font>

418
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,290
panicking a little more

419
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:14,430
good thanks guys appreciate y'all coming
