00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:54,710
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> town and uh we're growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up there</font>

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I was 18 years old i joined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joining</font>

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,050
military<font color="#E5E5E5"> and uh let me actually just</font>

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
just take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> step back back a little bit</font>

16
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,089
so my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Navy I worked the</font>

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,500
NSA for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while I worked at DIA for a</font>

18
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:11,750
little bit distant work at a dc-3 which

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,090
is de pensar burr crime Center and I did

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,820
work in DARPA so for up for all these

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,509
these different agencies and all these

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things I developed products</font>

23
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:23,780
actually develop tools scripts and all

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,869
that stuff which a lot of people do and

25
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,819
so over time I've always wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font>

26
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:30,229
created like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product company but</font>

27
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:32,119
everything I did it end up probably

28
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,770
being services because that's the easy

29
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,890
thing to do and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security</font>

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">personnel's we always do services which</font>

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:44,390
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unfortunate so over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time even</font>

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,599
when we're young we grew up and we want

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,880
to like sell something whether it be

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,310
eliminates than or anything like that

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,619
most of the most of the time is for

36
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,970
money and for money only and I see the

37
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,099
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing with security industries</font>

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:02,660
there are a lot of security vendors that

39
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:05,959
make products for money and and a

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,318
company purpose is to make money but it

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,480
doesn't originate from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a core need and</font>

42
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:13,099
what I've seen over time is most of the

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,799
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

44
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,500
successful in cybersecurity are the

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,140
actual tools that actually work the best

46
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,430
over time and you can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna name</font>

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of products i'm going to talk</font>

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,700
about why they were created so this is

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,200
really pretty cool book called start

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,089
with

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,760
has anybody seen heaven anybody read

52
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,879
this book that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic book</font>

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,299
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a interesting read it does a</font>

54
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,489
lot of case studies and it it looks at

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,190
companies and it tries to say why they

56
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:48,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">exist and like why like why did Steve</font>

57
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:51,459
Jobs create apple or like the purpose of

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,590
the company and in many cases this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

59
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,739
why the really good products become

60
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,890
really just really in really big

61
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:02,680
companies become successful in this book

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,380
it talks about how Apple Apple wants to

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,720
create disruptive technology and they

64
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,910
live their<font color="#E5E5E5"> core theme is just that this</font>

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,069
disrupt everything they disrupt the

66
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,819
computer game music industry every

67
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything they just live for disruption</font>

68
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,399
and so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go up a couple of</font>

69
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,140
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,970
security industry and tell you why I

71
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they exist in why they were</font>

72
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,840
successful so if necess necess is very

73
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,760
popular Nessus is even been bad mark

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,180
because they make a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people using</font>

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,828
assets and they say their pen testing or

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,049
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing security assessments but</font>

77
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,609
they are unnecessary but the cool thing

78
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> nelson says it started off with</font>

79
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the open source project and and I want</font>

80
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about that real</font>

81
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,679
quick too so open source projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

82
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,989
think open open source project I

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,160
actually compare our open source to the

84
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">drug game right and this is why there's</font>

85
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,079
a people think to take the average drug

86
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,910
dealer on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street think they can they</font>

87
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,889
can they going to be able to sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> drugs</font>

88
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,410
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rich one day and</font>

89
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:09,549
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the same lore from open</font>

90
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,950
source software so like they say if you

91
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">did like a survey somebody told me that</font>

92
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,819
most open source projects in after year

93
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,608
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in the security</font>

94
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,529
industry I see it every year there's def

95
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:22,180
con coming up black hat coming up people

96
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,888
to start off an open source project and

97
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,349
they do it just to get a talk or

98
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,210
whatever in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their thinking that if they</font>

99
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,099
do it open source they can pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some</font>

100
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,570
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of momentum and it can be a product</font>

101
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,490
and they'll build a company around it

102
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,229
all right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't work all the</font>

103
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,849
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I'm going to go over a</font>

104
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,859
couple of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were like open</font>

105
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,990
source but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the ones that</font>

106
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,580
everybody points to when they talk about

107
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source something</font>

108
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,469
and I'm

109
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,150
kill it and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be big so I</font>

110
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,190
kind of recommend against open source

111
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,679
until you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make a profitable</font>

112
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,410
business now that's my new that's my new

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,480
way of thinking so nurses for instance

114
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,820
Nessus actually was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> on necessity</font>

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,240
now we look at the Y Nessus was created

116
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so the reason why I was created</font>

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,860
is because it was it was a hacker he

118
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,830
wanted to do remote he wants to discover

119
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,070
motor vulnerabilities right and which is

120
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,780
cool because it came out of a need you

121
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,490
know and some make people may look at

122
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,070
the need and say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna Faris need</font>

123
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,170
but it comes out the why was so i can do

124
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,650
remote assessments whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was good</font>

125
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,660
or bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> tripwire another company that</font>

126
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">came up crippled are the same kind of</font>

127
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,880
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim was was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trunk from what I</font>

128
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,600
understand gene was trying to do

129
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,950
assessments of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether determined what</font>

130
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">their files has changed and it was</font>

131
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,880
pretty pretty simple in the concept he

132
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,250
did hashes and he compared two hashes

133
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,620
pretty novel concept but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't it</font>

134
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a necessity right and this is what I</font>

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,110
think that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about these</font>

136
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,810
are the these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the quote unquote</font>

137
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,750
outliers of the industry there's also

138
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,940
snort snort automated<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to</font>

139
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,640
look at pcap files and look at and

140
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,130
create signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sourcefire became a</font>

141
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,349
big company they went public<font color="#CCCCCC"> in narciso</font>

142
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,420
to acquire them but people like I said

143
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,880
this is this is like fools gold though

144
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,610
when it comes to creating products for

145
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,900
sure metasploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one local</font>

146
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,690
company and the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came in</font>

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Austin is work with rapid seven I'm</font>

148
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,070
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Texas and it was a great</font>

149
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to get back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here so the</font>

150
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,710
brisket and all that stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

151
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,080
could be consumed so I work with HD<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

152
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,020
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know him I'm pure truly</font>

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,090
spoken here before at last combo HD he

154
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,190
was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin testing and he wanted to</font>

155
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,799
automate that process and so he created

156
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,590
a tool I didn't assess it e in it and it

157
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,500
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did the project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got acquired</font>

158
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:51,169
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit I mean by rapid7 good</font>

159
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,140
friend of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine has actually did a spin</font>

160
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,130
off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit project and he</font>

161
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,270
actually creates this thing called

162
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Armitage which</font>

163
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,320
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know but the guy</font>

164
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,840
Rothfeld much behind it he<font color="#E5E5E5"> created out</font>

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,360
of necessity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for blue for our red</font>

166
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,250
teaming assessments so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,650
his passion was that's what he pursued

168
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,830
and now he has a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

169
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:15,200
it's just him by itself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what</font>

170
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,330
they call that it's a lifestyle type

171
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,310
business for him he makes good money he

172
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,440
travels on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world he teaches and he</font>

173
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,970
makes money off what he does done but it

174
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,640
started out with something he really

175
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,620
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed not something for anybody</font>

176
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,630
else and so a lot of the books I read is

177
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,130
called scratching your own edge you need

178
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,650
to you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find something that you</font>

179
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">are practicing about doing and then at</font>

180
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of the day I'll talk about later</font>

181
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,349
that's what like angels and VCs want to

182
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,390
look for they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for like is</font>

183
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,070
this guy really passionate about it you

184
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">know do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they understand business and all</font>

185
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,390
that stuff but a bit it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

186
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,190
be you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to vc route and</font>

187
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,710
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have armitage occur because</font>

188
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,360
Rafael does not want to he doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

189
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,950
any VC money he doesn't want any angel

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,200
money but he makes pretty good money

191
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:02,510
doing his pursuing his passion so anyway

192
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,550
I came here at Ralston for to work

193
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">arrived at seven I worked with the</font>

194
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">metasploit team when I was at rapid7 I</font>

195
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,780
actually came on as the community

196
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,310
manager for avid<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven you know I didn't</font>

197
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,510
read the job description for I take the

198
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:20,120
jobs all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it wasn't a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good fit</font>

199
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,909
because I'm a tech dude and uh and so

200
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,610
community manager types of is is a it's

201
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,590
a marketing role but what was cool about

202
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,840
that is that I got to work closely with

203
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,640
rapid seven marketing and their sales

204
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,760
team and I got to learn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about how</font>

205
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,880
business is done so i ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up working</font>

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,679
for them almost two years it was there

207
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,650
were some transitions and stuff and i

208
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,900
ended up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> fired by rapid seven and</font>

209
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,220
so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

210
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,720
reading a lot of books one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the books</font>

211
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">i read was called the Lean Startup</font>

212
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,040
because I've always built tools actually

213
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,570
built tools to rapid seven it's funny

214
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,400
because I was a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> manager but I</font>

215
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,390
still wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a techie and so that</font>

216
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,829
just wasn't a good fit and so I was

217
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,020
reading these books Lean Startup as a

218
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,330
book to all people if you want to that's

219
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,760
less like a like somewhat of a Bible now

220
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,960
everybody's talking about lean agile

221
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,819
development and all this stuff

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,070
that's a good book but the book they

223
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,680
like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blew my mind was this book</font>

224
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,450
right here it's called rework and if

225
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,670
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about doing any kind of</font>

226
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,950
company or anything or anything like

227
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,709
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this book like totally</font>

228
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,980
blew on mine is written by Jason freed

229
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:33,030
in David Hannum ire Henson<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhh txt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

230
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,350
guy that develop<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruby and uh so what was</font>

231
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,020
cool about it is that when I've worked

232
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,150
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metasploit team a little bit</font>

233
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,810
they program the Ruby the product was

234
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ruby on Rails and that's a big big deal</font>

235
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,050
actually there's a conference going on

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,480
called keep a ruby weird or something

237
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:51,569
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going on downtown my</font>

238
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,910
son's at that my sons are a really good

239
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,880
Ruby programmer he's at that conference

240
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,380
right now so what this talked about is

241
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,820
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one we're going to get</font>

242
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,660
down to building the product and

243
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,590
attracting money so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's this</font>

244
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,540
book talked about is is a and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

245
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,340
the cool thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i'm going to put</font>

246
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,270
put my hot dog stand up you see this

247
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,530
extravagant hot dogs down right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

248
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,900
think then when people think about

249
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,550
security products they think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

250
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,560
it has to have all these bells and

251
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,930
whistles on it all these analytics all

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,900
these things so at the end of the day

253
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,939
when most people have in mind if look I

254
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,920
could never build that you know that

255
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,140
system because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to have all this</font>

256
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,209
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all that stuff but what the</font>

257
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,040
book rework talks about is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

258
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:42,720
get to your epicenter of what you're

259
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,270
trying to do and that epicenter is what

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,330
are you trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplish now since</font>

261
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,460
this is AB set conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> if any lot of</font>

262
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,850
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and I know some some of</font>

263
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,230
you at this conference in general a lot

264
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have ideas to do something a</font>

265
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,860
better way you know it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

266
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,230
vendors in there maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have an idea</font>

267
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he's like not doing it right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

268
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,150
only thing you need is that singular

269
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:08,490
focus because the book talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

270
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:12,090
is that epicenter so the epicenter of a

271
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,290
hot dog stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the hot dogs so you</font>

272
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,720
don't have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the other stuff</font>

273
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,120
but if you just have a really really the

274
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,890
best hot dog on earth they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

275
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">get people from traveling up for miles</font>

276
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,699
around that's what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

277
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,299
about don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about the comp</font>

278
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:30,479
tuition so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was really good home</font>

279
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:34,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I i created a ruby on rails</font>

280
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,459
application called Fred agent and and I

281
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,108
was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this is going to be my</font>

282
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,599
company and probably the whole rework

283
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:41,970
methodology what rework talked about is

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,429
it talked about built building it and

285
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,899
building a singular thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like</font>

286
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:48,749
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you all</font>

287
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mistakes I made right so big big</font>

288
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:55,949
mistake was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually created</font>

289
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:57,329
thread agent just to make things easier

290
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,189
for other people but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't really</font>

291
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:01,529
super super passionate about it so what

292
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:04,529
I did is I bill 20 cent engine and I

293
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:06,209
actually people comparative to kind of

294
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,609
like multi go I did it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like</font>

295
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:11,069
automated you put in our company and

296
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:13,350
it'll main and it did all this ocean on

297
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:14,729
them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very cool right but I</font>

298
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,410
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> lie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wasn't really passionate</font>

299
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,569
about it and I've never been passionate

300
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,299
about offensive type stuff I'm a

301
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:24,059
defender I was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Navy I brought the</font>

302
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:28,379
NSA so all my life I've been like trying

303
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:30,299
to defend stuff so I kept them I kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

304
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,669
building stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't scratching</font>

305
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,169
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> niche and that's the problem a lot of</font>

306
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,939
times with people if you're not

307
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:38,329
passionate super passionate about that

308
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:40,829
that thing it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up being</font>

309
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:45,179
come falling short of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

310
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I created several things so what</font>

311
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,839
happened i created the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ocean engine</font>

312
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,939
and then i kept on building more and

313
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,739
more stuff in people if you know me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

314
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,748
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like every week i was building a</font>

315
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,279
new tool boom boom<font color="#CCCCCC"> boom and releasing</font>

316
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:58,529
them online<font color="#E5E5E5"> i built all these things</font>

317
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,989
tools that could be used for hacking

318
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote and I wasn't really super</font>

319
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,759
passionate about hacking I mean I can do

320
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,949
it but I'm not really that's not that's

321
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,389
not my bag baby as austin powers of say

322
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:14,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">i create this thing called honey dogs</font>

323
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,889
another Ruby on Rails application it was

324
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,419
pretty popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> our people spoke at Def</font>

325
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">Con and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat and all these</font>

326
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,869
different conversations talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

327
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,149
stuff that I built what what this was it

328
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:25,499
was a pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it actually let</font>

329
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,470
people track documents if they were open

330
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:30,600
across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world right but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

331
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,579
another like offensive typing deception

332
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,640
thing I really wasn't super passionate

333
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,800
about it but I built it right

334
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,160
had it up for over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here thread easy was</font>

335
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,229
up for well over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I built</font>

336
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,329
then I was like man this tour really

337
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't fit but I'm going to build this</font>

338
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,410
anyway so the name but<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still was</font>

339
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,330
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> exle trait and I built a tool</font>

340
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,180
that actually imitate<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised</font>

341
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:56,720
servers which is definitely relevant for

342
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,089
like further for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh wats type crowd</font>

343
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,390
I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaking data from from these</font>

344
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,310
fake servers and I built this but what

345
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,569
happened was I got fed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and tired of</font>

346
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,550
doing the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thread agent thing</font>

347
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,870
maintaining all these apps and said what

348
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,189
I did it's like look I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut</font>

349
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,950
down all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and just keep the</font>

350
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">oseon engine right then a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

351
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,550
people started contacting me and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

352
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,800
what word of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lean Startup book comes</font>

353
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,410
up right so the Lean Startup talks about

354
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,569
testing validation of your idea and it

355
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,459
also talks about pivoting a lot so

356
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,350
pivoting is like you build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

357
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,790
then people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like something else</font>

358
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,430
and then you kind of like take that

359
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,930
pivot and you run with that right so a

360
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,670
lot of times when we build stuff we

361
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,479
don't understand what the ramifications

362
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:40,819
are so I built up citrate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us</font>

363
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I built it I kind of shut it down and I</font>

364
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,590
only offered the ocean engine right so

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,510
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened after that if somebody</font>

366
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,760
came to me and said hey look Marcus

367
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,310
where is this exfiltrate to level I've

368
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,500
been using it I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

369
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:58,489
demoing it to customers because I still

370
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,580
dlp and I'm closing a lot of deals so I

371
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,900
wasn't making any money off exit rate

372
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,090
but there's people out there getting

373
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,340
paid off of I was like dang that's crazy

374
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,530
right and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are making money</font>

375
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,260
off it there must be something then so

376
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,300
what I decided to do is to do this i

377
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,460
created this thing called fire drill me

378
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,339
in a navy we do general quartered rules

379
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:25,390
all the time and if any Navy sailors in

380
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:28,490
her no sailors wow this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the set huh</font>

381
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,949
yeah so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sailor we did General</font>

382
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,050
Quarters all time military people they

383
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,460
do drills all the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I created</font>

384
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,859
this thing called for our drove me and

385
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,750
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pivot from from from</font>

386
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,930
thread agent to all the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

387
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">so were more I'm at now so when i worked</font>

388
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,229
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> dc-3 i worked with a popular hacker</font>

389
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,950
named Johnny long

390
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,260
we would do these intense we would do

391
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,590
these intense scenarios we built the

392
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,840
imitation enterprise network and I known

393
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network we did a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

394
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,860
simulations and we have a government

395
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,120
people on an outside these are like law

396
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,040
enforcement agents from all these

397
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,320
three-letter agency and stuff it was up

398
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,329
near NSA so we had all these different

399
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,550
spy agencies trying to find us on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

400
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,310
network so me and Johnny will imitate

401
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,199
Chinese hackers on the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

402
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,949
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different other threat actors and</font>

403
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,710
so that so anyway by doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that i</font>

404
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,500
learned how all these actors look on the

405
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,440
wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> i learned their tools i learned all</font>

406
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,480
this stuff so I'm trained as a hacker I

407
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,450
just don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that much it's not</font>

408
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,340
really my passion right but I know how

409
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,560
to imitate them right and so our creates

410
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,330
this thing is so it's kind of a pivot

411
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,030
off the exit rate things I was doing and

412
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,040
I actually emit that's what I do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

413
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,890
but let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about this</font>

414
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,439
is where the story gets real crazy right

415
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,160
and totally blows my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so I</font>

416
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,270
create this fire drill at me and then

417
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,130
actually start looking into how am I

418
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get get money to like funding</font>

419
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,810
because before I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bootstrap</font>

420
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,170
it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hurt right and pro</font>

421
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,780
tip number one right I wouldn't build

422
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,860
things for hackers if I were if you if

423
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,230
you're thinking about building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

424
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,359
business on yourself do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not build stuff</font>

425
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,360
for hackers because they don't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

426
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,649
nothing right and that was another part

427
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the turn agent thing I built all</font>

428
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,640
these awesome hacker tools but nobody

429
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,199
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use anything if they have to</font>

495
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,459
or startup I would definitely recommend

496
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:03,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you check out this website this website</font>

497
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:06,479
is a like a social network for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

498
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:08,309
seeking a venture capital right it's

499
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:10,649
crazy you can just put in what you want

500
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:12,839
to do and then companies contact you and

501
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,260
all this other stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the word</font>

502
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:16,560
is they

503
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,290
happen I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't going to mark 37 I said</font>

504
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,179
yeah that'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty cool and then so I</font>

505
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,889
actually could I started trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

506
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,630
pursue the venture capital route so I

507
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,570
actually put in a profile and all that

508
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,190
stuff and I followed my 37 f 6 x I

509
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,909
didn't apply to them right at this point

510
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,640
and this is where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets real freaking</font>

511
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,020
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my boy JP boy Jay you know</font>

512
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,530
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> might know him from the</font>

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,640
is where i'm going to a little bit talk

570
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:06,330
about my experience of my experience and

571
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,460
why I'm doing this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

572
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,220
said the whole important thing about is

573
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,080
why you create of these these products

574
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,980
and so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a little bit so</font>

575
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,550
this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of weird</font>

576
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,200
because i'm going to show you like how

577
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,389
you you could represent your idea at

578
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,560
this point so I'm not pitching you I'm

579
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing you a kind of hard pitch</font>

580
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,740
looks right for cyber security company

581
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:31,260
right and we need some we need help so

582
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,470
and the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm saying that we</font>

583
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,690
need help so if anybody in here instead

584
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this is my philosophy now instead of</font>

585
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,430
complaining about the tools and

586
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:43,199
securities messed up and if anybody

587
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,620
follows me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter you know I can</font>

588
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,870
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot so I've taken a different</font>

589
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,669
perspective and what I've done is I've

590
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,260
actually started like you know instead

591
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">of complaining let me try to do</font>

592
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,379
something about it right and that's the

593
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually help</font>

594
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,800
so if we have smart people that are

595
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,840
creating smart tools instead of the

596
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,810
industry giving us the status quo

597
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,870
garbage that doesn't work and there's a

598
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,340
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of garbage they don't work so i'm</font>

599
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,050
going to show you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how kind</font>

600
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,639
of like i would pitch my product if I

601
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,870

602
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,460
going to get into financial because it's

603
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,840
a whole different discussion but I'm

604
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just show you like kind of high</font>

605
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,300

610
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:33,030
it I wrote a song<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it you want her</font>

611
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:35,540
here go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right y'all more with this</font>

612
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">incident</font>

613
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,530
yeah captain Sully he go he goes down

614
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the he goes down to the Hudson but</font>

615
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:48,830
more chili everybody made it off come to

616
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,200
find out captain Sully he was he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

617
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,110
kind of a beast right this guy training

618
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,140
he was in he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in our force he trained</font>

619
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,840
other pilots he was an expert right and

620
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,750
also beside that he thought they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do</font>

621
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,970
any pilot does tons and tons and tons of

622
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,660
flight simulations right and those

623
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:11,300
flight simulations this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the first</font>

624
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,320
time he landed in the water and because

625
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,629
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would've did these kind of things</font>

626
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,919
in a flight simulation and so that's the

627
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,800
kind of approach that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring to</font>

628
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,780
network security network security most

629
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,450
of the time is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its trial by fire and</font>

630
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,220
nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is able to do simulations in</font>

631
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,260
their own environment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take</font>

632
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,480
somebody to send you can take somebody

633
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,760
to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other course but most of times I</font>

634
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,340
could sense what they do is they would

635
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,110
train they train people on open source

636
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,030
stuff that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an environment now any</font>

637
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,010
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot of tools</font>

638
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:42,110
deployed all around the network but

639
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:45,050
there's no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually test on your</font>

640
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:46,850
network until now what I'm doing is I'm

641
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:50,090
creating a product that actually uh

642
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:51,080
anybody stepped in late I'm talking I'm

643
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,850
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how you kind of</font>

644
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">pitched your product right so I'm not</font>

645
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,980
I'm not pitching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

646
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:00,860
so what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying</font>

647
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to build tool to to test personnel</font>

648
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,810
products and procedures because we know

649
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always don't work sometimes</font>

650
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,139
where people aren't trained sometimes

651
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,490
the products aren't aren't working well

652
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,110
and there's no way to validate

653
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,390
procedures and once you go through this

654
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:19,219
it early and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we did in the</font>

655
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">military</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what I'm doing</font>

656
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,500
with the product is I'm actually a i'm

657
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,300
calculating data loss of doing financial

658
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,020
loss calculations based on how much data

659
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:32,870
a company might lose and I'm actually

660
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">craft enough and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for if you're doing a</font>

661
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,020
product make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can do some</font>

662
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,060
kind of reporting and all that stuff

663
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,030
right because that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it gets</font>

664
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,340
management's I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to for</font>

665
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,350
this case the proposition that I was

666
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">making to them is look I'm hoping teams</font>

667
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,280
get better over time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

668
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,559
to see this go go opposite of that you

669
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,178
don't want to see a hockey stick

670
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,370
people getting worse all right you want

671
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see your everything going down so</font>

672
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's like that but that's like the</font>

673
00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:00,639
value proposition also like rotten

674
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:02,740
market this is important because<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

675
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:04,959
when you when you actually have an idea

676
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,970
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to get that get</font>

677
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,029
the idea to market and you can partner

678
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,230
with independent verification validation

679
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:16,690
they call them ibv those your KPMG's

680
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,159
pwcs<font color="#E5E5E5"> deloitte all those people if you</font>

681
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,860
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make a product that those</font>

682
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,279
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can sell you probably you might</font>

683
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:26,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in also security company</font>

684
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,679
partnerships<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally reached out to</font>

685
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,350
several different companies but but

686
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,350
here's the big role in if you if you

687
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,570
can't sell something yourself nobody's

688
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,850
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell it for you so if you have</font>

689
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,309
a product idea or something and you

690
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,559
think that you can sell it you sell it

691
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:45,850
first and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> give it to the partner</font>

692
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say look this is how you sell it</font>

693
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,529
right they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

694
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,539
how to sell it I don't care and also

695
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:55,210
security bars security bars will sell

696
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:56,799
anything but what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you</font>

697
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,929
want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy like when the</font>

698
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,610
security bar does bring up your name you

699
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have a website presence and all</font>

700
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:06,399
that death stuff to actually sell your

701
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:07,779
product for you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I drove me one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

702
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,580
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing is i'm doing</font>

703
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:12,100
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> this software as a service and</font>

704
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,549
this is really important because like

705
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:19,230
most most people nowadays they're tired

706
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:22,090
of their tired of anti virus type agents

707
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:25,029
nobody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do agents anymore right</font>

708
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:26,678
so you want to if you can try to create

709
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:28,269
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in the cloud they don't</font>

710
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,369
have to they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to try to</font>

711
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:32,230
install on there and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

712
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:34,059

713
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,190
simulation and this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like but</font>

714

718
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,870
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the this is the</font>

right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a couple of</font>

729
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want want people</font>

730
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,340
understand like far as like equity goes

731
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,110
and like sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

732
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,110
entrepreneurs and security people that

733
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,780
aren't aren't like in the business world

734
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,149
they kind of like two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

735
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,220
make mistakes on I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody</font>

736
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,890
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share our idea all right and</font>

737
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,530
the book rework talks about how ideas

738
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:38,560
are dime a dozen like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be scared to</font>

739
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,090
share your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas with people right I see</font>

740
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,340
it all the time where people would be

741
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,340
like no you gotta sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NDA I had to</font>

742
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,230
do tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to sign an NDA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

743
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,530
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them and try to help them I</font>

744
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,810
say dude I'm nobody sign NDA's like no

745
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,960
angel investor and OBC nobody is going

746
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:58,210
to sign any kind of that's not going to

747
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,190
happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to be willing to share</font>

748
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,830
your ideas so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually help</font>

749
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,080
you up all right number two is people

750
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,169
have the equity thing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messed up</font>

751
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,629
in the head the equity thing is pretty

752
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,880
interesting like for like thirty seven

753
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,560
I'm an early<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage company they gave me</font>

754
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,300
fifty thousand dollars per eight percent

755
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,010
equity right and some people like men

756
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,629
that my ideas worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million dollars</font>

757
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,370
or whatever but watch a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

758
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,400
shark tank and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll bring you back to</font>

759
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,590
reality a little bit but the big thing

760
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:30,790
is like the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

761
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:33,220
actually have vendors I mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but VCS</font>

762
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:34,870
and angels actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest in you and so</font>

763
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,960
you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your idea to the masses</font>

764
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,060
right it doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your idea</font>

765
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,010
is or what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product is it does not</font>

766
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,830
matter if nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever uses it receives</font>

767
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,770
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so since since security such a</font>

768
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:50,800
big scale big scale issue what you have

769
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is you got to get capital to</font>

770
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,700
actually take your idea to the Masters

771
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,809
right so now and somebody says like okay

772
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,299
cool

773
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:02,980
and so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do it equity round</font>

774
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,070
like every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you see a company doing</font>

775
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,679
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> seed round so every time you do</font>

776
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,240
like like a round a you're going to give

777
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:12,879
up thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent equity in your company</font>

778
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,649
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time you if you do</font>

779
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:16,209
three rounds like the original founders

780
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:18,279
are only going to have something like

781
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight percent equity ten percent equity</font>

782
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,899
in their original company so be prepared

783
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,389
to give up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equity over time if</font>

784
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:27,370
you if you go that route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font>

785
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:29,408
of scary like<font color="#E5E5E5"> man I you know I started</font>

786
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,029
this company but there but the people

787
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:33,249
that invest in you they want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

788
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,720
succeed as well yeah they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

789
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:37,299
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get paid and all that stuff</font>

790
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,740
but it's in everybody's interest if they

791
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,418
put money and they have skin in the game

792
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,240
they want you to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful as well</font>

793
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:46,450
so be prepared to have like a low equity

794
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,860
stake in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long run but hopefully if</font>

795
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,230
your company is doing 100 million in

796
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,418
revenue and when they sell security

797
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,549
companies or like tech companies like

798
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">software companies you're doing or what</font>

799
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:59,830
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> call a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 times 2 10 times multiple</font>

800
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,899
so if your company's doing 100 hundred

801
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,279
million dollars in revenue you can sell

802
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:05,768
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> company for like a billion dollars</font>

803
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,179
that's a that's a big big dream but if

804
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:10,960
you have eight percent of a billion

805
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,399
that's your your life<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the bank so</font>

806
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,499
that's that's the deal you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font>

807
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,899
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a product build a</font>

808
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,029
company and like increase evaluation and

809
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:22,508
prefer it be software because a lot of

810
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:25,629
us our mindset is like I'm good at what

811
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:27,369
I do I got my cssp but what you're doing

812
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:30,279
is you're trading your time for money

813
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when you create software you you</font>

814
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,600
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just create software once and</font>

815
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:36,009
sell a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times so that's a couple</font>

816
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,689
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I want the most important</font>

817
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:40,299
thing is don't be scared to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

818
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,639
idea if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't code</font>

819
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:44,740
learn maybe learn how to code enough to

820
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,479
put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> a PLC because they actually</font>

821
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:51,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">helped me out big time because I have</font>

822
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,009
oxygen code now and just we need more

823
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,139
tech people don't like people to

824
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:58,860
understand the problems because what's

825
00:32:56,139 --> 00:33:01,139
happening is you instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

826
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,178
technology-driven industry what the

827
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:05,780
infosec industry is now is a market

828
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:09,120
driven

829
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,760
where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just like spazzing out</font>

830
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,310
at the latest attack you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vector</font>

831
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,920
and all these other things and it's just

832
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,389
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sad business and I hate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

833
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,730
if you follow follow me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

834
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,310
you'll you'll see me a lot of haterade

835
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,270
in my blood sometimes so so the first

836
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:29,580
thing you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a most important</font>

837
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,770
part is be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell it yourself so</font>

838
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,899
if you can get what they call they call

839
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,120
it an energy they call them alpha or

840
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,130
beta customers or you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell</font>

841
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,500
it to a company for some kind of Mount

842
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,000
of money or sometimes they'll take like

843
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,740
an alpha customer if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

844
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,810
outfit customer like it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortune</font>

845
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,330
500 or something if you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

846
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,220
and get them to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vet what you're</font>

847
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,409
talking about or vouch for you the best

848
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,710
idea is to have a paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> off for paid by</font>

849
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:58,500
the customer and so you can say look you

850
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,720
know Exxon or something paid for this

851
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,280
right then you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool there's</font>

852
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,440
a real interest a real company bought

853
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what you're doing so that's the</font>

854
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">best way is to sell it yourself when did</font>

855
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,460
I start when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you start developing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

856
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,990
kind of depends on your agreement with

857
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,570
the company you're working on most

858
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:17,969
companies have IP clauses in your

859
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:21,240
contract right so if it has any kind of

860
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:24,719
IP clause in your contract you can't you

861
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> develop on your own time right but</font>

862
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,859
so my situation rapid7 fired me and I

863
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,560
was like I really cool I want to do

864
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,320
something else I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my own thing</font>

865
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,759
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create technology when I was</font>

866
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,130
it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I when I was leaving rapid7</font>

867
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,480
actually uh I got a patent when I was a

868
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,850
rapper<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 because I created something</font>

869
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,770
called browser scan is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product they</font>

870
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,290
called it so I actually built the rails

871
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,060
app so I kind of knew how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build apps</font>

872
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,850
and deploy them and all that so that's

873
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thing about working rapid7 it</font>

874
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,350
didn't it didn't work out<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term but</font>

875
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,600
short-term<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learnt a lot and I worked</font>

876
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,120
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool people there so</font>

877
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,460
the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the question is look you</font>

878
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,480
know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> your employment law says</font>

879
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,830
about IP you know you got to follow that

880
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,120
but all the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you belong</font>

881
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,640
learn as much as you can from your

882
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,259
current employer yeah so the cool thing

883
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,870
about being accelerate you get to learn

884
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,030
hey now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have my lawyers they're</font>

885
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,690
like really awesome orders 20 I have

886
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,310
like a

887
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,270
Lauren up now so I can kind of answer

888
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:27,089
that question so so what what you do if

889
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,490
you have an idea you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually file a</font>

890
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,140
provisional patent it costs like its

891
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,868
cheek as far as like a thousand bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

892
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,270
you pay a lawyer you do it you you can

893
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:38,940
file multiple of those and what they

894
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,800
call it you plant your flag and then

895
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,410
over time as you develop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> patent you</font>

896
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,619
have up to you to file a full pattern so

897
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:52,649
it's called a provisional patent so what

898
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:55,440
they do value<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that is they they it</font>

899
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:57,720
totally depends but the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

900
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,630
can do for an investor is to sell

901
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,209
actually sell or have people actually

902
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,130
using it and having it deployed but yeah

903
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:07,770
if you have sales the patents look great

904
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,829
actually I the pattern that i did a

905
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">rapid someone it looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like it got they</font>

906
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:14,579
actually uh you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

907
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,000
silicon valley bank if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have patents</font>

908
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:19,980
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take loans on patents</font>

909
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,450
and IP so there's all kind of different

910
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,339
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are figured out how to</font>

911
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,799
how to make money so what happens in

912
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:27,359
that situation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like comic</font>

913
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,329
what you're talking about you you have

914
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,578
IP you have a patent people can actually

915
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,990
take a lien on that patent and it could

916
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say this is</font>

917
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is worth three million dollars</font>

918
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:39,540
or something like that I don't know how

919
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,940
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it evaluation on it but at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

920
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,890
end of the day if you don't if you go

921
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:49,319
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business something the bank</font>

922
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:53,098
maintains that patent and so yep yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

923
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:56,250
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our big picture is uh you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

924
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to like get VC money but if</font>

925
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:01,920
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have like a massive</font>

926
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,560
idea and people copy like crazy man i

927
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,819
got like some of the things i built over

928
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,190
the last couple years<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got people</font>

929
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:09,900
blatantly copying it and ripping it off

930
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,380
and I've seen like three or four

931
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,079
businesses created even using my exact

932
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,599
language of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say like total ripoff</font>

933
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,079
of what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did and so you're going to be</font>

934
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,839
ripped off but and that's why I say that

935
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you do the VC route or the angle</font>

936
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:28,920
router and just get outside investment

937
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:30,540
it helps you scale well faster because

938
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,290
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of copycats if you go to</font>

939
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vendor booths</font>

940
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,490
I you know bless the vendors because

941
