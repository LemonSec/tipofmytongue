00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:36,870
I'm not Casey Ellis if anyone's not sure

known as stroller<font color="#E5E5E5"> valley because its</font>

parents kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put a bullet in that</font>

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,750
when they family plugging the computer

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone line and the police</font>

28
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,810
turning up when I was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a teenager</font>

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they said do we have to take this</font>

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,290
off you or is like is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,539
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about so I kind of</font>

32
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,430
stopped calling around BBS's at that

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,039
point in time and um started learning

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">see so here I am you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-year-old</font>

35
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:51,060
writing C code which got me in more

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,909
trouble and eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got into high</font>

37
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,630
school<font color="#CCCCCC"> and met some cool teachers and</font>

38
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,210
they pointed me in the right direction

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:02,429
so I spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my time building big</font>

40
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,520
commercial enterprise software for a

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,770
mining and engineering and health

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,320
companies and then we realize they do it

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,190
all really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really wrong and so I left</font>

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,290
that and started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

45
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,730
entrepreneurial startup thing and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,200
spend way too much time around security

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:21,000
folk so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get into the talk</font>

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,828
itself let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit</font>

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,510
about like basically I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> hito try to</font>

50
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:26,010
make you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> differently which is</font>

51
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally what the job of a hacker is</font>

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,600
right and let's be realistic about this

53
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,410
that it says here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to develop I</font>

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,829
am a developer

55
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:37,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not a break or a fixer I do break</font>

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,540
and I do fix but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a pen test</font>

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,180
stuff that's a its cases line himself

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm basically we're here to build a</font>

59
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,310
better hacker as in there talk about

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,570
developers is being hackers and then

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,770
security people as being hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

62
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been inflated basically let's look</font>

63
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,020
at development and security practices

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,910
and let's see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do to build</font>

65
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,300
them both up and essentially end up with

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,040
a really tightly coupled blue team so

67
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,210
I'm there's actually a few people I

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,000
thought it'd be talking about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

69
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,140
that I know so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick show of</font>

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,840
hands who build software for a living

71
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay probably bid on behalf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so who</font>

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,710
breaks for a living<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's like</font>

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,790
a quarter of you don't do anything right

74
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,100
so who does both things who's involved

75
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:32,340
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing like building set up yeah those</font>

76
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,989
are the people who I don't envy so like

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,910
just look in a situation here is that

78
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,950
you know building and breaking like

79
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're both really different which is a</font>

80
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">good thing and say what hey you know</font>

81
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,760
like how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work like if we're</font>

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">both different how can it be good and so</font>

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,899
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like it you know it</font>

84
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,040
balanced out this lovely Zen you know

85
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,470
yang that you need within an

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,480
organization and the paid to do

87
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,740
completely opposite things and so the

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,709
thing that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at is so how</font>

89
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,090
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> work together and if you consider</font>

90
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I means probably hard to see there</font>

91
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,580
but the yin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang like most</font>

92
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,680
organizations aren't sitting like that

93
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,450
they're sitting like that but they kind

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,170
of bash together you know whenever

95
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,089
anything happens so looking you know so

96
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:14,429
like let's look at like the actual

97
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,640
problems that come up in this type of

98
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,280
situation so let's start with developers

99
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,200
and what the incentives are there so

100
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,590
anyone who raised a hand earlier would

101
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,450
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely familiar with the idea of</font>

102
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,119
a deadline for a new feature or a new

103
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,979
product and you got zero input into it

104
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,130
and it came from<font color="#CCCCCC"> some going to suit</font>

105
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,090
who's the head of sales and marketing

106
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,190
and so it's like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to push</font>

107
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">this out by then of course that comes</font>

108
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,669
with the territory of like hey when's

109
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
that going to be done when's that going

110
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,979
to be I was like hey go away and just

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,940
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me do what I'm doing</font>

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,860
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what the security</font>

113
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">teams job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is which is to make sure that</font>

114
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,320
the devs don't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lets bad</font>

115
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,910
guys in the 100 degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 180 degrees</font>

116
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,010
away from what the developers being

117
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:02,860
pushed to do so if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this some</font>

118
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,140
things to think about here is that when

119
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider like the idea of a hacker</font>

120
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,780
is that people like you know if

121
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,580
someone's like oh you work in security

122
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,710
like you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be have like reset my</font>

123
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,260
hotmail password for me because people

124
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,030
really greatly overestimate like the

125
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,380
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually do</font>

126
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,419
like this there's people who can do like

127
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">some really gnarly shit but you know</font>

128
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,300
generally people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that there's</font>

129
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,210
this whole like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their watch too</font>

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,320
many movies basically it doesn't mean

131
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're security people are necessarily</font>

132
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,490
better it just means that there's

133
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,690
they're really useful but that can also

134
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,020
be the pain the ass you're literally the

135
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,400
guy paid to say no<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the next just</font>

136
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,780
is it like this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit fair</font>

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,239
next time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the point</font>

138
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,250
where like you know smashing a hammer

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">against the developers head and let's</font>

140
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,330
consider like the motives that they've

141
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">been they've been pushed with and I also</font>

142
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,340
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it takes to actually</font>

143
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:54,099
launch it like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial product so</font>

144
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,630
another point looking at the developers

145
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,880
problem all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff slows us down and</font>

146
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,500
so what happens is that people buy

147
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,050
products because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got functions and</font>

148
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,290
that keeps everyone in a job and if you

149
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept of open SSL at open</font>

150
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,400
source so why didn't we find heartbleed

151
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,070
was because they were motive was their

152
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,929
intention was to keep it functional and

153
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,010
functionally relevant so you know it's

154
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,490
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font>

155
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,830
a really famous saying about with many

156
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,540
eyes or bugs of shallow but if you look

157
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,550
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other way around it's like with</font>

158
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,110
menu eyes and the right incentives or

159
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,610
bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> at shallow so they weren't</font>

160
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,740
incentivize to be looking for something

161
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the</font>

162
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,250
security problem which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> around hey</font>

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,900
like well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I see all these</font>

164
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,870
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on moment these developers</font>

165
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking me seriously so where does that</font>

166
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">work like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not becoming Chicken</font>

167
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Little become that guys like hey the sky</font>

168
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,830
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> falling and everything's you know we</font>

169
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,250
go to do all this really good stuff in

170
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,520
like the sky doesn't fall most of the

171
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,810
time

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,650
and so you're not having this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

173
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,960
where like you become numb to that the

174
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,919
incessant sort of like hey this is

175
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,650
happening this happening but like

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:11,480
literally what's going on here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

177
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:14,789
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not seeing the problem and</font>

178
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,260
as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying the area development</font>

179
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,550
contributes to the product which

180
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,150
essentially means dollars come in the

181
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,430
door and security meta- is that but

182
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,729
without security maybe something will

183
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:29,130
happen on maybe won't and what's really

184
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,820
clear is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how this works in</font>

185
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:36,350
organizations all the time so let's look

186
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what the real problem is here</font>

187
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,720
developers don't believe in the

188
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,260
boogeyman the guy that's already you

189
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know got shell on your production boxes</font>

190
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,849
is already like has access to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

191
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,990
email everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he needs and the</font>

192
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,669
devs literally there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

193
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever like you're waving your hands</font>

194
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,969
you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care and so the</font>

195
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,680
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the security team is that</font>

196
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,930
like amongst all the other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

197
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,460
have to do in their day they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

198
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally don't have the time to come</font>

199
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,219
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and convince these developers as</font>

200
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,360
stop that too I you know believe me when

201
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,210
I'm waving my hand saying hey this is a

202
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,979
real problem and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting</font>

203
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,870
thing is thanks to every security vendor

204
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,930
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> their sales teams for</font>

205
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,640
making this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and that while</font>

206
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,130
fight is you know go so far for

207
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,320
awareness it's also the fatigue that

208
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,520
kicks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then no one listens it's</font>

209
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,560
hard to reverse from so if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

210
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,919
what the situation is for an engineering

211
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,260
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> their tech</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checklists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the test gets</font>

212
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,210
run when they're checking stuff in it

213
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,010
runs CI servers and using less fancy

214
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,270
acronyms that they change every three

215
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,760
weeks because it's the new cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

216
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we force them through a security</font>

217
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,339
awareness training and everyone knows

218
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,990
like even training<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do yourself like</font>

219
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,130
three days later like half of its gone

220
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,560
it's things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

221
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,790
stuff over a time a good time period and

222
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">like have it sort of drilled into you</font>

223
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,930
and then add<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that like pen testing</font>

224
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,820
and all the other outsource company is

225
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know someone that you know they</font>

226
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,730
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any control over come in and</font>

227
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,660
produce this report and then they walk

228
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,640
away so in the eyes of a developer it

229
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:16,790
looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a blocker</font>

230
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,790
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ah</font>

231
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,770
and I see everyone's laughing because

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and laughing again</font>

233
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,610
because he knows it's true what happens

234
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,010
is that this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work over the long</font>

235
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:38,530
time and so the big thing here is how do

236
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,500
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the business the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

237
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:44,230
to believe in the boogeyman and it's

238
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,330
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that hard and the great the</font>

239
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,820
benefit is that awareness of the

240
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:53,800
boogeyman outweighs any annoying

241
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:57,100
checklists that you may have and the

242
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,329
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is really simple the most</font>

243
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,680
efficient way to get something the

244
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,110
attention it deserves is to set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,780
fire the Picard management tip and

246
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,340
courtesy of Casey which is a nice nice

247
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,540
one there so technically you didn't

248
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,140
actually say this but you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

249
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,260
that he would now let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at mcafee</font>

250
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,670
version and this does make sense the

251
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,830
more security we're an organization will

252
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,959
ever be is straight after a breach and

253
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:24,340
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't say that by these</font>

254
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,440
burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> benjamins because it's true so</font>

255
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,200
let's take that and look in the context

256
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,790
of the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or maybe you're</font>

257
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let touch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer I mean two</font>

258
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,730
great examples target and<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPMorgan Chase</font>

259
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,350
well let's hire a new fancy CI so oh hey

260
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:45,190
we're a bank we better throw a ton of

261
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,690
money at this now etc etc and like

262
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,130
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all cool like you know once we</font>

263
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,080
have this venture in the position like

264
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,280
people listen they know the boogeyman

265
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,790
exists and that's cool but how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we</font>

266
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,829
prevent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> proactively and one of the</font>

267
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,750
without pitching the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

268
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of that is a bug bounty is really</font>

269
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,230
effective all the time so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bug</font>

270
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,540
bounty it's basically like a contest

271
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,010
where security researchers compete to be

272
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,589
the first to find vulnerabilities in

273
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:18,520
code and in return they get cash and

274
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,610
social recognition um and it all really

275
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,449
started with Mozilla and zdi way back in

276
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:27,310
nineteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety five then around 2010</font>

277
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,530
some big tech companies started coming

278
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,420
in which was good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we're good for</font>

279
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,650
the awareness but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was bad because</font>

280
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,569
everyone knows that like all these sort

281
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,610
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bay Area or you know these like</font>

282
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,810
up-and-coming startup companies that get

283
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,250
like five hundred million dollars in

284
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,560
funding like they're all crazy they just

285
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,980
spend money on you know massages and you

286
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,119
know sleep pods and stuff like that and

287
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,520
then you notice like just<font color="#CCCCCC"> past there</font>

288
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,860
around 2013 which is a what we call the

289
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,020
BBA SS which is the bug bounties as a

290
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,300
service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where bugcrowd and how</font>

291
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,300
many many on growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and upcoming</font>

292
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,770
competitors came in that sort of that's

293
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,630
starting to ramp up button it's all

294
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,090
really changed like end of last year

295
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,580
when microsoft said<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we're doing this</font>

296
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,490
so now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a large you know</font>

297
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly stagnant enterprise company</font>

298
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,600
that's like hey we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

299
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:19,300
real and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of exploded and so</font>

300
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,780
the thing here is that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just about</font>

301
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,849
being cheap and loud it's a bold

302
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,170
statement and the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes from</font>

303
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that crowdsourcing this has</font>

304
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,770
proven to be across many different

305
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,699
business models to be a low-risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

306
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective way to get a desired</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outcome</font>

307
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,300
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case of security is more than</font>

308
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's about leveling out the playing</font>

309
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,000
field the economics of security testing

310
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,060
a disadvantage when you compare the

311
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,200
economics of what the hack brought what

312
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,760
our attackers have in their hands

313
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,610
another big thing is about introducing

314
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,040
your business to guys like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this anyone</font>

315
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,060
doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is eager</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Homer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cove</font>

316
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,680
he's also known<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the guy that</font>

317
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,849
basically owned github and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like God</font>

318
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,370
he's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy who thinks like a bad</font>

319
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,370
guy and the thing is once you meet this

320
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,630
guy it's like to think so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

321
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,710
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there outlet out there like</font>

322
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's is what's his</font>

323
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,200
neighbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at and so what happens</font>

324
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,380
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that bug bounties can create a</font>

325
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,410
series of controlled incidents to be

326
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,650
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey the boogeyman exists</font>

327
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,089
look what this kid can do but guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

328
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,670
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the press you know we</font>

329
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,640
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been tagged crunched where I</font>

330
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,410
would control this an incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

331
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,189
incidents like this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an 18</font>

332
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:41,980
year old kid on your shit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

333
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,300
effective and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen so that's a</font>

334
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,770
let's look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little story here a</font>

335
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:51,209
couple of stories

336
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:52,860
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1995 when</font>

337
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,260
Mozilla kicked off their very first bug

338
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,380
bounty you see everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came in</font>

339
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,700
initially which was front loaded the

340
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,020
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of came in and swept the floor of</font>

341
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,020
all the basic stuff like they have a

342
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,630
fresh I mean somewhat fresh as it from a

343
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,250
security perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands an</font>

344
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,330
engineering team who kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font>

345
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,370
didn't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were doing but you</font>

346
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:16,200
can see they very quickly in the course

347
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:18,210
of three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months got a clue and then what</font>

348
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,880
happened is it then slowly came back up

349
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,250
again and disappeared and the sort of

350
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,590
what happens with this is how most bug

351
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,850
bounty type engagements work and that

352
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,480
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy stuff gets cleared out</font>

353
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">straightaway and a little bit later the</font>

354
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,140
good guys come in and then they find the

355
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">real stuff the the real business logic</font>

356
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,090
floors this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's like</font>

357
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,770
well someone could do that like that's

358
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:45,020
you know that's a serious issue we need

359
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this yeah</font>

360
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:53,550
and so having run 125 things just like

361
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,630
this we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pattern every single</font>

362
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:00,300
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when we say every single time</font>

363
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,950
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost predictable I can say</font>

364
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,790
to someone ok cool we're just kicked off

365
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,870
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do in</font>

366
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,000
three months time so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna do in</font>

367
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,680
six months time here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example</font>

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,680
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial services company very</font>

369
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,890
large very old and receive an extortion

370
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,839
attempt from Eastern Europe and so it

371
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">was really cool they basically said hey</font>

372
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,290
look you deal with these kind of people

373
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,390
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do with this and we said</font>

374
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,199
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's tell this guy ran a bug</font>

375
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:31,530
bounty program only<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certain people</font>

376
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,700
we added him in it was clearly displayed

377
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,040
yeah we'll pay this much for these

378
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">things it was asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for like two</font>

379
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,640
thousand euro or something for what he

380
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,460
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying was like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very big</font>

381
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:44,580
vulnerability put the appreciative

382
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,860
information to him it came in basically

383
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it was very simple like self XSS</font>

384
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,839
which you know you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix but it</font>

385
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,209
wasn't the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the world they fix it</font>

386
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,980
very quickly and the guy was happy you

387
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,579
got paid and then went on to find and

388
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,869
submit a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font>

389
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,429
they could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exact opposite</font>

390
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,079
way with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and been like okay cool</font>

395
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,980
guy was<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he just need</font>

396
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:14,980
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit attitude adjustment yay</font>

397
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:21,889
there's another really good example of

398
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,238
social media company and they were

399
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,749
having a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard time getting in</font>

400
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:29,149
buying from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management in the</font>

401
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:32,239
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there yeah let's just</font>

402
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">set something on fire so they gave us a</font>

403
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:36,259
ring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said hey let's uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's uh what</font>

404
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">some fires under some pieces here and</font>

405
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,369
basically they had the budget to hire

406
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,469
three more people when I don't know if

407
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:48,589
you know this San Francisco tech area

408
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:52,429
like people aren't cheap and so yay and

409
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:54,379
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the best stories a</font>

410
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,749
very old<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-established</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ecommerce</font>

411
00:16:54,379 --> 00:17:03,199
provider who'd been using a redacted

412
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:05,569
product getting cleaned up results we

413
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,638
launched something with them and within

414
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,859
24 hours someone basically was admin of

415
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:11,869
admins and owned their entire ship and

416
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:15,379
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the company that is pulling in</font>

417
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,938
millions of dollars a month and like

418
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,380
their opinion was it they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

419
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">no we're on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top of this you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we've</font>

420
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">got an internal team which is great but</font>

421
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,319
as we know that internal team is not in

422
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,230
a position to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to look at every</font>

423
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,230
single thing that goes out great success

424
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,399
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at some ideas that come</font>

425
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,649
from this what if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this around</font>

426
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:41,989
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually say hey engineering</font>

427
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:43,610
team like you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do better we</font>

428
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,370
cannot allow we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lots of</font>

429
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:51,350
money to augment<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security team to</font>

430
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,779
find issues and we to pay out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

431
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,158
and whatever it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get paid out you</font>

432
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,899
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know put on a</font>

433
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,669
big party or you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and buy</font>

434
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:04,370
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> your iPad a as iphone 6s or you know</font>

435
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:06,620
black phones or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it you</font>

436
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,059
know engineers are into these days and

437
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,379
you can do this internally as well and

438
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this with a number of</font>

439
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations and its really</font>

440
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,260
really effective so are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to</font>

441
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,590
start like you kind of think yes but

442
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,570
there's some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know the</font>

443
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,970
first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by grantees are</font>

444
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:29,720
awesome and you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> great results it</font>

445
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,250
frees you up as a security engineer to

446
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,660
look after the things that you need to

447
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can pull the levers more than</font>

448
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,540
actually like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blink it</font>

449
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,670
in what you're doing and developers get

450
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,870
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you don't have to be</font>

451
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,020
seeing them<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day you know kicking</font>

452
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,209
them in the river and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

453
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,250
they're awesome but they're also really

454
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:58,160
hard and when you launch something it

455
00:18:49,250 --> 00:19:01,850
looks a little like this and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

456
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,810
at what the submissions over a typical

457
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:10,010
12-month period look like it just gets

458
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:13,340
pretty crazy this is about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> density</font>

459
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">per reporter so you need to plan ahead</font>

460
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:22,459
and luckily there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple things</font>

461
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:25,730
that we've picked up from running 125 of

462
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,520
these four different companies and along

463
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,680
these lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single most golden rule</font>

464
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,870
is that if you touch any code or you

465
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,940
reconfigure something then it's rewarded

466
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,489
so whether you have to deploy something

467
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,320
or you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Miss configuration</font>

468
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,270
of SSL because you know you've still got

469
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,490
boxes you've got a disabled who door for

470
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:50,510
it and own it with engine X or whatever

471
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,810
it may be and pay it out that's someone

472
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,700
doing good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you and single mistake</font>

473
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,700
that everyone makes is they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

474
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,630
I'm going to get all these bugs and all

475
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,940
this works going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be around</font>

476
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,470
remediating all these bugs and what they

477
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,870
find is it's not it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font>

478
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,730
people so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're starts you have</font>

479
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,290
you're going to find as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know things</font>

480
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,540
take time to fix like you've got

481
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,110
engineering teams that have like you

482
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,889
know however long their backlogs are

483
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,290
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be saying hey you got to</font>

484
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,600
go fix this they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be like</font>

485
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:22,370
some time the problem is that because

486
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,320
you don't you it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fixed right away</font>

487
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,459
something else is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find it the</font>

488
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,610
night of ends else after someone else

489
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,500
why

490
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,729
it now the two people find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it after my</font>

491
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,470
other two people find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for more people</font>

492
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,059
find it so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all coming in they're</font>

493
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:38,929
all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be saying when's it going</font>

494
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:40,670
to be fixed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're there going so</font>

495
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:43,490
the important thing is to make sure that

496
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">you align the expectations before you</font>

497
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:50,929
engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd like that and so the</font>

498
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,000
important that the big thing there is

499
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,580
this looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what you've got and is</font>

500
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,860
gauging how much volume can we handle

501
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,049
coming in from from a researcher

502
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,490
community and is this something we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

503
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:05,210
to do publicly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this something we want</font>

504
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,710
to do privately and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is</font>

505
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,540
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come back to what can the</font>

506
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,240
engineering team handle what's going to

507
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,918
let us feed information to them to be

508
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,929
fixed that isn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them going</font>

509
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:20,330
oh hang on slow down slow nights later

510
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:23,960
what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sustainable so in</font>

511
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,360
conclusion bug bounties are very cost

512
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,620
effective and very highly marketable as

513
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,178
you see in the press but and they do

514
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,790
can't rate create controlled incidents

515
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,500
and they do help raise awareness for the

516
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,760
builders the people who look after the

517
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:42,590
builders and then ultimately the people

518
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,140
above that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really effective in you</font>

519
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">should start one but again make sure</font>

520
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,710
that you look into how are we going to

521
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,230
make this sustainable within our

522
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,850
organization and like there's nothing

523
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're doing that you couldn't do</font>

524
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:59,120
yourself just means you need people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

525
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:01,730
do it we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got plenty of great articles</font>

526
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,010
on our blog yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will we work very</font>

527
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,370
closely with companies when they

528
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,220
launched with us in particular but we

529
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,899
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the just speak broadly we also</font>

530
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,640
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual researchers coming to us</font>

531
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,770
saying hey this company doing it by

532
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,570
themselves I'm not playing fair and then

533
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,220
you know where where it's appropriate we

534
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,750
step in and go hey like this guy is

535
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pretty much totally owned you</font>

536
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,400
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to listen it is</font>

537
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,630
important to make sure that you do to

538
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,940
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the belt like if that</font>

539
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,610
was the particular scenario like that's

540
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,380
a really good bug if I was a vendor I

541
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,639
mean I am a vendor if I was a vendor and

542
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,410
I was using a third party and people

543
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,960
were owning could attack us through that

544
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,730
third party I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like you're out</font>

545
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,049
so and i would pay that person like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

546
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,120
changing my configuration there's

547
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,879
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm doing on my page to</font>

548
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,168
pull in that advertiser and so regard

549
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,090
like regardless of how they got the

550
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,909
actual attack in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to drop</font>

551
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,830
that advertiser late so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not changing</font>

552
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not fixing their problem but my</font>

553
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,539
problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got a third party</font>

554
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,908
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has you know you know</font>

555
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,559
hopeless I mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope you know like</font>

556
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's they don't care as much as I do</font>

557
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,809
so straight away it's like okay well I'm

558
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,279
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

559
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean that particularly like this is</font>

560
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,980
what you get for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ad</font>

561
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:15,260
networks as well like they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

562
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">most delatori</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> late show me the money and</font>

563
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,960
then they're out of there but yeah

564
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,610
definitely the it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough one you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

565
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
talking about people now so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

566
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,178
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like cool I get it</font>

567
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,450

approach it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like oh this is</font>

583
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,479
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst thing in the world and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

you might find it comes in in like a

589
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:11,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">five-line report this company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

590

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,750
which is getting exposed on your page

592
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,110
but they're not explaining that

593
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,179
correctly so the thing there is around

594
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,219
deciding hey like if I'm using things

595

people like that I need I can't just

start off with everyone in anyone

597
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,750
because I know that these vendors that

598
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,639
i'm using are going to get owned and

599

something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would say look</font>

602
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,760

603
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,340

607
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,730

thing with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy coming around the</font>

00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,700
expectations and making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

623
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,920
problems because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ultimately like</font>
