simple cross-site scripting attack of

12
00:00:53,810 --> 00:01:02,930
the page can be used to kind of hijack

13

the entire website all other pages<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

17
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:18,800
there's some downsides that and I'm

fifty-three of Fortune 500 companies use

00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,929
it and that number is definitely going

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,420
to grow in the coming years so what are

29
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the things that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added in</font>

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,679
html5 very useful things right there's a

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,720
web storage for example allows you to

32
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:11,060
store local data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and / system</font>

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,030

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:19,910
creates a direct connection to another

35
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:22,400
computer sandbox attribute so you know

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,810
how a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of plugins work marketplaces</font>

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,750
work of this world

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:30,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">sent box attribute supposed to be</font>

42
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:46,828
right most of these are canvas canvas

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:11,579
develop data pages for developers so

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,439
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

51
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:17,790
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to start with</font>

52
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,280
sandbox anybody know what sandbox is<font color="#E5E5E5"> si</font>

53
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,760
box I should be good that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,510
quizzed by the way at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end so pay</font>

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,078
attention is a reminder same origin

56
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,340
policy that actually existed before

57
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:40,799
sentox<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentarse margin policy means that</font>

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:44,519
the iframe will have access to the

59
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,609
parents Dom if it has it matches the

60
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,889
scheme hostname<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the port number it's</font>

61
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,940
basically page iframe originates from

62
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:56,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same page as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact the same</font>

63
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,599
source of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pan</font>

64
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,900
so a lot of websites use it right to to

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,988
embed different parts and so in this

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,560
case let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we have a page called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CNN</font>

67
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,069
and it wants to set background on<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine</font>

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:24,340
frame because I frame has the same

69
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:32,560
origin Dom access works but if the

70
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:41,530
iframe is a different origin doll<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:42,750
doesn't work great however this system

72
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,559
kind of breaks down if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:51,400
marketplace<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 3rd party plugins I think</font>

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:56,789
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know salesforce com office</font>

75
00:04:51,400 --> 00:05:01,359
365 marketplace there are third-party

76
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:04,810
JavaScript or pages HTML pages that you

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,160
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to serve from your side but you</font>

78
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,789
don't want them to have access to the

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,300
rest of the web page so same origin

80
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:16,680
policy doesn't work and therefore

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:21,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">SANParks attribute was added in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

82
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:24,220
sandbox attribute negates this same

83
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:29,380
origin policy puts restrictions on what

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:32,710
I frame can do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy it in fact by</font>

85
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:36,639
default if you send box that I frame it

86
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:40,840
cannot do anything it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very useful</font>

87
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,849
I frame can be just displayed can

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,109
display static pages only can

89
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:51,460
transcripts um can do top navigation

90
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:53,889
test allows forms etc etc but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

91
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:57,669
relax restrictions from the sandbox you

92
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:00,960
can put attributes that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scripts</font>

93
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:04,590
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and a lot of other things</font>

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just a sample</font>

95
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:14,969
sandbox is relatively new<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's supported</font>

96
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:17,859
in IE starting with version tab recent

97
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:24,130
chrome and firefox horse WebKit browsers

98
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:27,400
support as well so what happens by

99
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:32,620
default even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> i frame has the same</font>

100
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:36,940
origin as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main page if we send box</font>

101
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:40,270
it with default permissions we get a

102
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript execution error basically no</font>

103
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:51,549
scripts allowed however if you relax

104
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,370
restrictions and we add say margin

105
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,560
allows a marriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> argent policy then our</font>

106
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,560
scripts continue to work as they used to

107
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:09,550
top navigate right that allows the inner

108
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:13,090
iframe page to go up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DOM and</font>

109
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:17,310
basically have access to the rest of the

110
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:23,638
parent page without that permission

111
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:23,639
javascript in iframe cannot do it so

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,530
however since we allowing scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

113
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:35,750
run and we allowing say margin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Palace of</font>

114
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:40,190
our policy a very simple JavaScript can

115
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,840
go fine top if we allow right if we

116
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:47,810
allow these permissions and add

117
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,760
permission to yourself to have top

118
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,510
navigate I took well just about any

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,770
relax any restrictions in the sandbox so

120
00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:02,020
a simple combination of safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> SOP and</font>

121
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:10,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">script basically negates all the sandbox</font>

122
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:14,690
restrictions find out ed permission to

123
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:20,140
myself and boom I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

124
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:24,380
entire page so keep that in mind when

125
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:27,050
creating a sandbox don't tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> SOP and</font>

126
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:31,750
scripts at the same time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

127
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,750
essentially negating the sandbox

128
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:44,629
that was sandbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> ow are we doing great</font>

129
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:47,029
canvas canvas<font color="#CCCCCC"> l love canvas it's a well</font>

130
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:49,639
actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't because I can draw but</font>

131
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:53,149
now graphics people love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

132
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:56,089
care and that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to you know to</font>

133
00:08:53,149 --> 00:09:00,879
escape the boxes of html5<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be</font>

134
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:04,040
creative but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

135
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:08,930
how a simple cross site scripting on one

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:14,660
page I can actually enable hijacking of

137
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:17,660
the entire website in this particular

138
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,469
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take screenshots</font>

139
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,490
of other pages on the website with a

140
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:29,420
little bit of a twist<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so um I</font>

141
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:32,829
would have should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do slides or should</font>

142
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,829
i do live demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do both</font>

143
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:47,390
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bookstore login page it's</font>

144
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:54,020
pretty simple bookstore application um I

145
00:09:47,390 --> 00:10:00,490
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> can look in get to my other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

146
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:04,460
but login page actually has a as a

147
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:08,620
cross-site scripting vulnerability which

148
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:17,830
allows execution of any arbitrary script

149
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:17,830
right easy to miss things like that so

150
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:33,590
the attack the attack actually puts an

151
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:36,140
iframe over the page and for the

152
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,570
purposes of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo we actually keep</font>

153
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,750
that I frame with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little nice border</font>

154
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,000
so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but of</font>

155
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,120
course real attack would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no border</font>

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,890
and to the user you know this would

157
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
actually be this would look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

158
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:58,150
normal login page except it's hidden

159
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind a fan so to the presentation</font>

160
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,820
if user users<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really careful them</font>

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,380
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay attention to the URL so</font>

162
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,640
the URL will remain the same even though

163
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:18,700
we kind of navigating through your

164
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:26,500
website the attacker then gets a set of

165
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:28,960
pictures screenshots and twist in the

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,630
screenshot is it I can actually undo the

167
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,660
password attribute on the password field

168
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:39,960
and have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> screenshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a username</font>

169
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:46,569
and password send to my server in Russia

170
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:50,530
I'll use Russia I can do it so how do

171
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:52,990
how do we do it right we use canvas I'd

172
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:58,390
canvas actually allows us to walk the

173
00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:01,150
entire dome the page so there's a an

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source script called HTML to canvas</font>

175
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:15,060
allows basically walks the dog and takes

176
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:15,060
a screenshot of the page it's very quick

177
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:23,829
script and we're going to modify<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

178
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:29,460
little bit to undo password attribute on

179
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">an input field before taking screenshot</font>

180
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:56,180
so you see that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures have been</font>

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,180
taken every two seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I as I</font>

182
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:05,939
use my my website these screenshots will

183
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:15,870
reveal the password and I'm typing here

184
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:20,070
I'm actual pre-need see pre-need

185
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,920
technique actual allows you to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

186
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the page is structured how the users</font>

187
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,300
navigated learn passwords and then go

188
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,730
attack it later so those starts with a

189
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,099
with a simple process scripting attack

190
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,700
alright cross-site scripting attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

191
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,640
guess a common typically harmless right

192
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,640
you we kind of think that oh yeah my

193
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:49,020
help page gets defaced what's the big

194
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,319
deal all the big deal is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

195
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a key you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually if you're not</font>

196
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,730
careful they're not really sorrow in

197
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:59,100
testing all of your pages in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

198
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,470
application you can open yourself up to

199
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,470
a pretty significant attacks as well

200
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,060
so

201
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:16,200
what can you do to prevent it I'll test

202
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">your websites for cross-site scripting</font>

203
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:28,230
all pages in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website for cross-site</font>

204
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:31,180
scripting so are an extension of that is

205
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,740
that we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how cross-site</font>

206
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,839
scripting can allow attacker to take

207
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,750
screenshots of your page it can actually

208
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,690
be used for different purposes can be

209
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:46,230
used to get behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall as well so</font>

210
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:51,130
if the script that we inject in the page

211
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,200
uses web socket for example can use to

212
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:56,760
scan the entire map the entire network

213
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,800
topology of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

214
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:05,740
and of course execute behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

215
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:09,069
firewall typically so i can take Jace

216
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,290
makan ah it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> casual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a website</font>

217
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allows you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the mapping in</font>

218
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,319
normal world inject it through

219
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,180
cross-site scripting into a vulnerable

220
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:27,100
website and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of screenshots</font>

221
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:32,219
receive a map of your other equipment on

222
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,220
the network so

223
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:41,550
again not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page other servers</font>

224
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,050
might be vulnerable to attack so

225
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,750
cross-site scripting is not about it's

226
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:54,709
not only about defacing and web pages it

227
00:15:48,750 --> 00:16:02,160
can get be used for some advanced

228
00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:05,760
advanced techniques great efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

229
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">sockets efficient protocol can think any</font>

230
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,870
connection server but at the same time

231
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,620
get opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> by holding your firewall</font>

232
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:31,410
client side business logic what does

233
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that mean inside this is logic means</font>

234
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:37,020
that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a lot of illogic in</font>

235
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:40,230
the JavaScript<font color="#E5E5E5"> that executes a client</font>

236
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,810
it's very efficient you know you save on

237
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:47,570
server communications give you a lot of

238
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:50,910
processing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript however</font>

239
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript that executes sonic light can</font>

240
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:58,110
be easily tempered with all right so

241
00:16:52,829 --> 00:17:01,380
remember that you push a button<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

242
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:06,300
the web browser see the JavaScript you

243
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:09,329
can play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I don't know how</font>

244
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:15,409
bad this only<font color="#E5E5E5"> security vulnerability it</font>

245
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:18,510
is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be yeah can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be used to</font>

246
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,880
for example in the example in the

247
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,730
example develop i'm going to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID get</font>

248
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,760
too used to tamper with some data comes

249
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:33,380
back to the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play a movie</font>

250
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,379
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a tricky</font>

251
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:43,259
tricky thing to to demo here

252
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,750
so everybody familiar with pac-man right

253
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:58,910
you try to eat this may be things to see

254
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,289
well I yeah I see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of younger faces</font>

255
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,320
in the audience may get<font color="#E5E5E5"> off time</font>

256
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:06,320
although there's a I think of pac-man

257
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,678
machine here somewhere so a lot of

258
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,990
JavaScript games have their business

259
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,500
logic and the climb<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we can</font>

260
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually kill modify the text that the</font>

261
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,970
code to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that instead of I</font>

262
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,510
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether they hold</font>

263
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,600
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that eat you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ghosts yeah</font>

264
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:33,169
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghosts eating you you get to</font>

265
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,750
eat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghosts so you know that Ghost</font>

266
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,740
sometimes can get into this scared state

267
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:42,130
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can eat them so it's a very</font>

268
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">frightening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state right so very simple</font>

269
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:53,020
JavaScript code when a palacian and save

270
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:01,380
and when I'm going to replay the game I

271
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,929
didn't actually have to do anything I

272
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,780
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stand there find these ghosts</font>

273
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:14,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ghost will find me except</font>

274
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead of so notice the high school</font>

275
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:24,900
right I just stand here and wait for

276
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:27,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to come to me and so a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

277
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">people use the JavaScript and these</font>

278
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:35,190
games for promotions and marketing of

279
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:37,370
some sort high score just if you have a

280
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,350
high score for the day you win something

281
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:45,780
well i'm going to easily have the high

282
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:52,889
score for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life and in fact</font>

283
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:56,100
probably overflowed it so that's yeah

284
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,480
that's the business side glide side

285
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,480
business logic right

286
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wonder if that game machine is also</font>

287
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:18,840
acceptable to so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I should</font>

288
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,550
have you try it out Oh geolocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

289
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's an interesting another</font>

290
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:29,899
interesting feature recent feature

291
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:34,170
allows a web page to track your location

292
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:37,430
of course use are supposed to confirm or

293
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,430
give access

294
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:51,709
but how do we trick users into giving

295
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,870
our malicious website access to their

296
00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">location and two other things like web</font>

297
00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:09,350
camera or microphone let me go to the

298
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:12,799
devil lots of pictures Sarah for the

299
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,789
demo we get a play a little game of

300
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,908
whack them all right the object is to

301
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:23,090
push you know to use the mouse to press

302
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:25,940
a button<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

303
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,500
by an engineer at the buttons<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kinda</font>

304
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,620
you know the game is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

305
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:37,700
interesting right but of course can be

306
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:40,870
made the board more interesting so I'm

307
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:44,029
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to click here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click here click</font>

308
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,489
here but remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

309
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:49,340
canvas and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> clicking what I'm</font>

310
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:55,809
using is not the real mouse pointer real

311
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,809
mouse pointer is up there oops

312
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,199
but

313
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,600
I hope it doesn't end up on 4chan but

314
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,770
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the idea all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's a</font>

315
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:21,480
it's a little bit of social<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering</font>

316
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:24,780
and a little bit of engagement actually

317
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,690
cut the coordinates are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to</font>

318
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:31,020
calculate based on whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser</font>

319
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:35,480
supplies right the screen resolution

320
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:39,650
type of browser OS things like that and

321
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:44,270
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's playing this game quickly</font>

322
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:51,150
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that the</font>

323
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:52,430
the pop-up went away and now my simple

324
00:22:51,150 --> 00:23:00,080
game has access to your camera

325
00:22:52,430 --> 00:23:00,080
microphone location history exam

326
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">well there's really no way to to deal</font>

327
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:17,210
with it except teacher users not to play

328
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:20,840
games of unknown origin on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

329
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:24,230
I guess you can tell them to pay

330
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:30,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to the little permissions box</font>

331
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:35,120
that shows up no professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

332
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:37,899
had a farm ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of schedule but the</font>

333
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:43,219
summary is that html5 and JavaScript

334
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:46,460
bring new powerful tools but with those

335
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:51,799
new tools come through sponsibility to

336
00:23:46,460 --> 00:24:00,700
use them wisely that's it questions

337
00:23:51,799 --> 00:24:00,700
answers hope you enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font>
