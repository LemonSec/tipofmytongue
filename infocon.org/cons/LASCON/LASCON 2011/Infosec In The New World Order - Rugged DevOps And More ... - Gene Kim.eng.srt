00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,180
how it can enable developers to maximize

throughput of features from code

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,229
complete to production without causing

they one two three is this better okay

42
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so in 1999 I started my journey</font>

43
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,530
studying a group of organization that we

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,700
used to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> genes list of people with</font>

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,690
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> kung-fu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right these are</font>

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,250
organization to talk a little

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,990
differently act a little differently but

48
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,970
most importantly they had profoundly

49
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,230
different operational results than your

50
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,180
typical IT organizations they had

51
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,890
phenomenal service levels that great

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,510
security had a great posture compliance

53
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,519
an instance interestingly enough they

54
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,109
had the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> project through put this</font>

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,520
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years my mission is becoming</font>

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,920
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> capture and codify what those</font>

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,850
organizations are doing differently and

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">how do you capture their good to great</font>

59
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,570
transformation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to talk to</font>

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,489
you a little bit about visible ops but

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,230
more specifically I'm here to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

62
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the I guess the platitudes of</font>

63
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,488
information security I mean you know in

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ideal can be viewed as a critical</font>

65
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,760
capability for the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help the</font>

66
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,989
business prevent security breaches from

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,280
happening and then when security

68
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,880
breaches do occur detect and correct

69
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,830
quickly but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in my journey the</font>

70
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,959
more dismal reality is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

71
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,090
securities probably more likely to be

72
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,709
marginalized by the business in capable

73
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,600
of affecting how daily operations is

74
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,190
performed and that we're sort of viewed

75
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,930
as the shrill hysterical people who

76
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,180
stuck the will to live out of everybody

77
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,400
we touch and who are focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,620
technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutiae and you know are</font>

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,840
basically you know bypassed as much as

80
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,190
possible in terms of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it development</font>

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,930
and operations are performed does anyone

82
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,570
have a friend who's ever been called any

83
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those words shrill hysterical yeah</font>

84
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,209
that's the seeds of some of the worst

85
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,760
words I think that have been associated

86
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">with me so I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind</font>

87
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what I've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,549
have let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

89
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send how do we reduce the activate</font>

90
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:36,630
patient energy around how do we get dev

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,519
and ops to work together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

92
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,000
you have information viewed as a

93
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:45,060
critical stakeholder and consultant in

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,410
that process so um you know just briefly

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,350
this is set some context when I talk

96
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,820
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-performing IT organizations</font>

97
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,290
now when he first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

98
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,540
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way Peter</font>

99
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">perfetti was I think at MTV interactive</font>

100
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,720
networks of time he was one of them it

101
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,040
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting to see where these</font>

102
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,630
leaders came from whether they came from

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,670
the ops or secured organization they

104
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,140
came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of three backgrounds they</font>

105
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,950
were either a noncommissioned officer in

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,929
the military right<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically e5 or e6</font>

107
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,060
their chemical engineer or they were an

108
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,670
auditor and not just any auditor with

109
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,280
green<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeshades CPA right it was an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

110
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,918
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> can anyone to speculate well</font>

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,380
what values do these three professions

112
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,599
have in common<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCOs in the military who</font>

113
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">give live ammunition to 17 year olds</font>

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,270
right chemical engineers and auditors

115
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:37,740
anybody attention to details good ties

116
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,720
that that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes that's maybe as</font>

117
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,600
superficial well one<font color="#E5E5E5"> James that's very</font>

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,490
good yep process good right in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

119
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,320
process attention to detail do what I

120
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,510
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with was rigor and discipline</font>

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,729
right non-commissioned officers give

122
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,260
ammunition to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 18 year old right</font>

123
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:53,580
where oh I learned in my journey was at

124
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,960
restaurant operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't even</font>

125
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">like giving knives to 18 year olds</font>

126
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,020
because you combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight-year-olds</font>

127
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,090
knives and raw carrots you have an

128
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,460
access so high that you know it makes

129
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">your insurance liability go way up</font>

130
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,430
chemical engineers have long elaborate

131
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,320
recipes and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss sequence them</font>

132
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,150
right endothermic can become exothermic

133
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,620
and people will lose fingers or worse

134
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,840
and then auditors they just love

135
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,040
controls right and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

136
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,359
throughout my journey right I've

137
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,770
comforted I still believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,790
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was critical in terms of sort</font>

139
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,039
of solving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the puzzle what high</font>

140
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,570
performace looks like so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wrote</font>

141
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:23,010
the visible ops book one of the thing

142
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,419
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is really describe</font>

143
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,099
quantitatively what does

144
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-performance look like by things</font>

145
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,950
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can measure with a stopwatch a</font>

146
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,900
ruler or a dollar sign then here's what

147
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,090
we found after benchmarking over 13 and

148
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,429
IT organizations we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that high</font>

149
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,799
performers or had the best posture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

150
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,479
compliance as measured by the fewest

number of repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto finding meaning by</font>

152
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,320
a factor of a fourth but x factor for

153
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,000
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were spending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one-third</font>

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,090
the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time prepping and liaison</font>

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,200
you know for those audit activities

156
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,789
secondly there were because they were

157
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,219
integrating into the process not just

158
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,110
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> project secondly they found and</font>

159
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,400
fixed security breaches faster in other

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,050
words when<font color="#E5E5E5"> security breaches happen</font>

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,789
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Murphy does exist high</font>

162
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,350
performers and low performers high

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times more likely</font>

170
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,450
compliance angle we got the security

171
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,620
angle they're also more operationally

172
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,690
effective they're implementing and

173
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,640
authorizing 14 times as many changes

174
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,440
with far better outcomes the changes

175
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,930
failed one half as often and when the

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes blew up the first fixes</font>

177
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,280
work four times as often and you when

178
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,900
you measure the 71 outage profile they

179
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,869
were down less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tenth of the time</font>

180
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,000
right so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much matches the security</font>

181
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,900
fine and fixed pattern and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing such a great job in</font>

it and eradicate and find work there's

185
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,130
fart spending more time on planned work

186
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,690
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so consequently when they're</font>

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more plan work done they get</font>

00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,020

192
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:58,889
more applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> in production</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">six times there many more applications</font>

194
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,449
just briefly does this resonate with you

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of like you know hi what here</font>

196
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:09,960
what seems to describe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-performing</font>

197
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,008
IT organization thumbs up right great by

198
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested in any of</font>

these statistics just email me I'll send

200
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides is all publicly available</font>

201
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,380
so you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

202
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if that's what high performance</font>

203
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like right what serve</font>

204
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,990
characteristics or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a culture to be fine</font>

205
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,270
in every high performer what we found

206
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,860
early in our journey was that you know

207
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,719
literally in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 15-minute conversation</font>

208
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,860
with one of these leaders you could tell

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,780
there's something different about these

210
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,490
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean literally I think</font>

211
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,719
we never actually did this but you know

212
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,250
our assertion was that we could train a

213
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
high school student to look for certain

214
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you listen for certain keywords right</font>

215
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,630
and we could actually predict with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

216
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">high degree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of accuracy we believed</font>

217
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,510
right whether they're a high performer

218
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,250
or not and the scientist actually did

219
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,680
prove this out but we never did the high

220
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,330
school experiment we find that every of

221
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,520
these high performers had what we call a

222
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,409
culture change management meaning in any

223
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,729
one of these organizations the only

224
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:00,449
acceptable number of unauthorized

225
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,340
changes was zero exactly right and so

226
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,599
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged say Mike prospect</font>

227
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,340
that your stock exchange right it is

228
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,990
like doesn't isn't change manager

229
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,429
bureaucratic doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world to</font>

230
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,289
live out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everybody it touches and</font>

231
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,909
they would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely not right we</font>

232
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,560
conserve still very fast right we do

233
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:15,180
over a thousand production changes with

234
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,340
a change success rate of<font color="#E5E5E5"> over ninety</font>

235
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,840
nine and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent so our reactions</font>

236
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,179
like wow okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not slow at all</font>

237
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,008
that's very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast secondly we found</font>

238
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that each one of these organizations had</font>

239
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:29,550
a culture of causality meaning when in

240
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,810
fact let's do the anti-pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

241
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">they came out with a study that sort of</font>

242
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,169
crystallized this concept for us they

243
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,208
<font color="#E5E5E5">found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when they looked at their</font>

244
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,900
customers their customers the highest

245
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:41,939
service levels and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best customer</font>

246
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,470
satisfaction we're rebooting the server

247
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 times less often than their average</font>

248
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,980
customers and they had five times for

249
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,540
your blue screens of death and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so when</font>

250
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,980
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the statistic we fell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of a</font>

251
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,050
chair so I because it very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> match</font>

252
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,520
what we saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our high performers when</font>

253
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,630
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes wrong and high-performing</font>

254
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,800
organizations they know that eighty

255
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,180
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all outages are due to a</font>

256
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,920
change in the environment or change of

257
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,000
the application and eighty percent of

258
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,500
meantime prepare trying to figure out

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,730
exactly what change so where did suppose

260
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">high performance look first was</font>

261
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:09,840
something went wrong eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of</font>

262
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,890
outages issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> are caught</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by change APN</font>

263
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,970
mean temperature tryna figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

264
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,660
changed so where do where they look

265
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,460
first in the repair cycle change exactly

266
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,439
right what do low performers do they

267
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,940
reboot things right if something doesn't

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
work right reboot the server if that

269
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,640
doesn't work reboot the server next to

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
it if that doesn't work reboot all the

271
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,220
servers if that doesn't work blame the

272
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,140
firewall guy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're</font>

273
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,730
always causing outages right and that

274
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,920
drives<font color="#E5E5E5"> down for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his fixed rates that</font>

275
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,970
drives up meantime prepare the third

276
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,069
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was found was each one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

277
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,320
these high performers had a culture of

278
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,330
planned work of trying to find various

279
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,610
early before it would cause a mammoth

280
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,320
disruption right so what Jennifer bait

281
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciso their Stern's for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years</font>

282
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,190
said to me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us it's a</font>

283
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,140
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a low fuel light and</font>

284
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,190
a car right versus six<font color="#E5E5E5"> people running</font>

285
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,170
down the highway<font color="#CCCCCC"> with empty gas cans</font>

286
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,270
right the trick is when that low fuel

287
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,520
light indicated goes on right cue up a

288
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,960
project for next<font color="#CCCCCC"> week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we can</font>

289
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,030
fix in a planned way without disrupting

290
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,290

you measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is high performance</font>

292
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,469
spent five percent or less of their time

293
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,510
on plant unplanned work lower

299
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,180
friend right so I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> but parts</font>

300
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,439
of my journey as a DBA I was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

301
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,410
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you know I was causing</font>

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,580
unplanned work for other people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

303
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,680
goal with the visible ask because to

304
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,630
really sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of create a descriptive a</font>

305
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,280
prescriptive approach to how do you

306
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,570
build these controls and operations and

307
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,089
how to secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the integrate into that</font>

308
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,800
and what through the reason we thought

309
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was so important was that unlike i</font>

310
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,490
tol unlike cobit those are descriptive

311
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,440
frameworks those are like a catalog of

312
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,820
processes and controls right what we

313
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,250
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> was we're here are the four</font>

314
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,470
projects that result in the

315
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,120
implementation and opera

316
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,670
operationalization of these controls and

317
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,990
so as mentioned earlier so the

318
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,339
surprising kind of consequence of

319
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,780
writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that it went out to</font>

320
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">sell some like 200,000 copies where</font>

321
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,910
people

322
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,840
carried by controls I mean how utterly

323
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:02,280
surprising but that's been awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

324
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,260
had mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me on the bench marking</font>

325
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we did we did we benchmarked over</font>

326
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">1300 organizations really trying to link</font>

327
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,590
controls with performance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal</font>

328
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to say you know hey is there a small</font>

329
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">subset of controls that you can focus on</font>

330
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,960
that result in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a disproportionate</font>

331
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,250
improvement in performance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

332
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there were literally three things</font>

333
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could ask that predicts sixty</font>

334
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,109
percent of performance in other words

335
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,900
every one of the metrics that I talked

336
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,310
about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can predict you know with by</font>

337
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,540
putting and asking three questions and

338
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,300
putting them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spreadsheet so those</font>

339
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,579
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions are to what extent does</font>

340
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,069
the organization define monitor and

341
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,960
enforce some sort of configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

342
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,880
strategy right saying here is a known

343
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,320
good build for the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

344
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,390
have a high degree of mastery over that

345
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,590
security is properly reviewed and here

346
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,449
are the defined ways that the

347
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">configuration</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be deployed right</font>

348
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,080
that is again blessed by everyone in the

349
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,110
organization was QA development and

350
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,270
security second is to what extent is an

351
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,950
organization defined monitor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

352
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,970
some sort of process discipline right

353
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,740
especially on the change in

354
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,270
configuration practices right in other

355
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,490
words when security says hey we have

356
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,290
found you know sixteen percent of

357
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,450
configurations in production don't match

358
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,069
the known good<font color="#CCCCCC"> states right Kent doesn't</font>

359
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,540
management hold people accountable for

360
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,760
truing up those configurations right

361
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,449
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's application database OS</font>

362
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,280
networking etc and then third is to what

363
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,440
extent does the organization define

364
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,959
monitor and enforce some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

365
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,520
controlled access to production and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

366
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,350
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use as the anti-pattern</font>

367
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,970
developers with daily access production

368
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,230
but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as have been working with</font>

369
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the DevOps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> committee which i believe is</font>

370
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,160
actually one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best hopes for the</font>

371
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,140
information security organizations to

372
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,430
actually become relevant and integrated

373
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,490
daily operations that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not kind of a</font>

374
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,329
moral sort of like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very messy</font>

375
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,910
thing so instead of picking on

376
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:44,250
developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> on pick and dba's right when</font>

377
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,680
you have uncontrolled access of like

378
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,350
dba's in production on a daily basis

379
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,449
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct data edits right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

380
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,100
code issues things like that are

381
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,960
actually just that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

382
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,820
indicator those control issues right so

383
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,560
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things put into a</font>

384
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,700
spreadsheet would predict security

385
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,050
performance compliance performs

386
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,020
operational performance and project due

387
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">day performance before I go any further</font>

388
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,730
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that resonate with you guys do you</font>

389
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,730
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that credible</font>

390
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,060
awesome so they so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal of science</font>

391
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,770
is to explain observable phenomena

392
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeply-held intuitions and real</font>

393
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,770
surprising insights when we did this

394
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,540
research I mean it was sort of really

395
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,780
jumped out as like yeah that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

396
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,459
be the ticket so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me tell you a</font>

397
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,220
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about my darkest moment of my</font>

398
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,420
journey right that we did we understood

399
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,890
what high performance of play we wrote

400
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">it down and put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a book we raised</font>

401
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,250
over 1.5 million dollars to benchmark

402
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,340
these organizations try and link

403
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:39,160
practices with performance and what I

404
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,510
found was that it really didn't create

405
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,280
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of engagements and the</font>

406
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,720
groundswell that I had personally hoped

407
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,390
for so after spending you know three

408
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,740
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life doing this</font>

409
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,600
right-hander it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically I</font>

410
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,040
felt like nobody cared right and so one

411
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,870
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in</font>

412
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,599
fact you know why so one of the things

413
00:13:52,870 --> 00:14:00,040
I've so grown to hate in my journey is

414
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,710
platitudes right so as defined by a

415
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,920
banal trite or stale remark like as

416
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,330
evidenced<font color="#CCCCCC"> by buy low sell high right you</font>

417
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,620
know it's technically probably true

418
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,450
right it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> how a lot of wealth</font>

419
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,300
has been created but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

420
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,830
tell you how and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel sort</font>

421
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of into a platitude in other words</font>

422
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,580
here's some platitudes for<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

423
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,290
security speak in the language of the

424
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,640
business and help foster the right tone

425
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,800
at the top and you know I trusted

426
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,750
relationship with the business because

427
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a genuine relationship with the</font>

428
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,230
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stakeholders that's mutually</font>

429
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,640
respectful and then we can be savvy and

430
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,370
take advantage of compelling events like

431
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,660
the sony breach like anonymous and

432
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,220
because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a real</font>

433
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,350
security program compliance we become

434
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,360
free and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

435
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,640
everybody's responsibility means

436
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,690
nobody's responsibility right and so

437
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,400
we're gonna you know drive the

compliance program not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the auditors and</font>

439
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,329
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to create a real assess</font>

plan design execute monitor or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDCA</font>

441
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,320
loop and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a right</font>

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,060
control environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will help</font>

443
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,290
drive the right outcomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">compliance and that one's last one is</font>

mine right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I know</font>

446
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,459
I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I found is it</font>

447
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,319
wasn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and so I found this</font>

448
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,730
very disturbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

449
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did too when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fat sort of hit</font>

450
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,720
bottom or what do I thought was bottom

451
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,170
was saw some advice one of my longtime

452
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,970
mentors is a Terry bailiff he was I met

453
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,430
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he was a CTO at verisign so</font>

454
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,290
arguably he was responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

455
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,279
availability and security for the single

456
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,560
point of failure on

457
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,389
our internet right had to grow capacity

458
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,279
a scale of 14,000 of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moore's law</font>

459
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,110
gave him only ten percent right so an

460
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,269
incredible engineering operational feet

461
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,339
and one of the things I'm most proud of

462
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,230
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wrote the forward to the</font>

463
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,300
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> edition of visible ops and so I</font>

464
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">came to him with this problem I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

465
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,279
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> airy how do I get people to care</font>

466
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,470
right how do I get the business to

467
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,170
actually say hey there's a huge business

468
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,540
benefit for having great controls and

469
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,009
you know can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give me some help and</font>

470
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,480
in fact I might have had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint</font>

471
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,600
presentation when I talked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I</font>

472
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,860
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember but yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the gist</font>

473
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,689
of my discontent was that information

474
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,639
security operations are always viewed as

475
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:05,860
tactical right the development people

476
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,329
were always or viewed as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's</font>

477
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,980
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get us to market they get the</font>

478
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:11,469
budget they get to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortcuts</font>

479
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,209
they get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions</font>

480
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,709
that result in technical debt for

481
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,268
information security and operations and

482
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,069
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arey</font>

483
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,230
what can I do differently and what I

484
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,509
found in hell I even said hey I even did

485
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,420
the science right why don't people care

486
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,860
and what he said to me actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like was</font>

487
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,059
one of the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that anyone ever</font>

488
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,680
said to me in my life right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

489
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:32,680
actually I found it personally hurtful

490
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,508
he said gene in 40 years everybody will

491
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,599
understand this so don't make a moral

492
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:39,220
issue out of it just qualify better when

493
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,809
I heard that I mean Lou I think I had

494
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,540
luck tears welling up in my eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

495
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:45,189
I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expected him to serve tell me</font>

496
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,839
send me on a journey to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go seek wisdom</font>

497
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:49,870
right and come back when I've learned it

498
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,970
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said qualify better write to</font>

499
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,910
me it was like he had abandoned me and

500
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,009
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally I left a wreck for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

501
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,709
two weeks I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in this fog where I felt</font>

502
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,329
betrayed and abandoned and i couldnt

503
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:03,279
believe that arey would give me crappy

504
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,539
advice like that but it turns out there

505
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,970
was actually part of the most important

506
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,199
piece of advice I've ever gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

507
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,939
actually pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> me into something when</font>

508
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">he was the CEO of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo that opened up</font>

509
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">my eyes to that has changed the entire</font>

510
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:20,319
trajectory of what is now my area of

511
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:23,620
passion so what's he did the right

512
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,270
here's what he hears what working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

513
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">yahoo showed me and then I saw the ganda</font>

514
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,359
AOL then I started again at Microsoft's

515
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,129
on the largest Internet companies around

516
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,799
right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started seeing it in</font>

517
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,570
even typical enterprises right and so is

518
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,120
like the guy in sixth sense rights you

519
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,710
see the dead

520
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,659
bodies are everywhere and it made me

521
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh my gosh this is actually a</font>

522
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,230
large problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this is a way to view</font>

523
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,750
the problem and communicate the problem

524
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:48,260
that will make people care so here's

525
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,700
what we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see was from the</font>

526
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,770
operations perspective and i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

527
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,110
about security later is the operation

528
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,700
people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez right i'm pissed off</font>

529
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,559
because fragile applications are being

530
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,000
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> continually deployed into</font>

531
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,740
production that are prone to failure

532
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,260
right they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even designed to run</font>

533
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,630
right you know they barely stay up there

534
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,640
not secure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if when something goes</font>

535
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,110
wrong it takes a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for the to</font>

536
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,720
figure out what bit got flipped in other

537
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,850
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1d</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the worst thing is is that</font>

538
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,610
the detective control of like how they

539
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,550
detected the the drift from standard

540
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,559
operations was not a modern control<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

541
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,750
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> salesperson in Vietnam wondering</font>

542
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,750
why ads being served in their market are

543
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,340
being upside down in Spanish right and

544
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,590
it takes too much time for the

545
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,290
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restore served correct</font>

546
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,879
service there's too much time spent fire

547
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,100
fighting and being spent on unplanned

548
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,840
work which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that we can't do the</font>

549
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,649
urgent work that security<font color="#CCCCCC"> is giving us</font>

550
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,209
by the way if you know they're

551
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,179
inflicting this endless hamster wheel

552
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,890
pain for us which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our other</font>

553
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,840
planned project work can't complete

554
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,610
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no many of our</font>

555
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,309
frustrated customers can't get what they

556
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:54,260
need and they leave and so our<font color="#E5E5E5"> market</font>

557
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,149
share goes down which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font>

558
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,690
mrs. the commitments I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wall</font>

559
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">street which means that they will make</font>

560
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,230
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more audacious commitments to wall</font>

561
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">street often dreamed up by art majors</font>

562
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,200
right and so suddenly here's what dev

563
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,240
sees they'll see more urgent date driven

564
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,980
projects put into the queue which means

565
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,010
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> more fragile code into production</font>

566
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,990
right and suddenly things that we're

567
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,190
working before<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so well</font>

568
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,740
things that used to take an hour to

569
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,450
deploy take a day take three days take a

570
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,970
week take three weeks take<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months</font>

571
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,410
right these turbulent installs by the

572
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,730
way is this resonating with you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

573
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:32,120
how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I have a friend</font>

574
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,650
who's ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this ok</font>

575
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome right</font>

576
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,910
now the deployment is getting more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

577
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,889
more turbulent and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> release release</font>

578
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,930
cycles are now getting so long and so

579
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,610
arduous that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business says hey look</font>

580
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:48,640
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lengthen the release</font>

581
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,409
cycles right so we can amortize the cost

582
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,630
of deployment which means are even more

583
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:55,960
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces and things changing so the</font>

584
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,820
disaster even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more catastrophic which</font>

585
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,410
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we do</font>

586
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,600
a deployment the most senior operational

587
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,550
security and developers just to do

588
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,199
deployments which means we can't we have

589
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ever growing backlog of important</font>

590
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,610
things to do right and ever amount of

591
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,850
increasing tribal warfare between ops

592
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:17,199
and development and let alone security

593
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:20,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the big aha moment for me was</font>

594
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,820
this point right here right is when the

595
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">business starts missing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wall Street</font>

596
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,310
commitments and starts having to make

597
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,020
even more audacious commitments right

598
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,970
the aha moment for<font color="#E5E5E5"> green is like wow</font>

599
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,860
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an operational problem that's</font>

600
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,510
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even an IT problem right that's a</font>

601
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,879
business problem right I think so the

602
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,710
relief that I had when I realized okay

603
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,350
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deming meant when he said</font>

604
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,740
survival is not mandatory right I felt

605
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:47,050
like our job ends there right our job is

606
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,750
to expose this vicious feedback loop and

607
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,790
if the business can't act and put it in

608
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,020
the right corrective actions then you

609
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,550
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of above our pay</font>

610
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,020
grade right and not at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we're</font>

611
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,909
really looking you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we need they</font>

612
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't deserve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to survive so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a</font>

613
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,200
big sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a ha moment for me and what</font>

614
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,090
I found was that this one slide has

615
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,040
become almost effective sort of selling

616
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,709
mechanisms of like how do you sort show

617
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,560
this problem exists right and how do you

618
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the collective will and of dev ops</font>

619
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,169
and security to solve a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big problem</font>

620
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,330
that can make a huge business impact so

621
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,520
you know the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> framed this for</font>

622
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,169
years was you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is such a core</font>

623
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,150
chronic conflict it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

624
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,770
dev is motivated to you know deliver

625
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:29,470
features quickly which means many make

626
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:31,060
many changes whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> ops is up you know</font>

627
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,740
I've chartered to deliver stable secure

628
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,020
predictable service which means make no

629
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:38,260
changes right so therein lies a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

630
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,460
core chronic cultural conflict and you

631
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,530
know there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to do both and I</font>

632
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,360
think security is uniquely<font color="#CCCCCC"> positioned</font>

633
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,520
and has unique expertise you know to

634
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,110
help break this conflict and what's

635
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
interesting to me right is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

636
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,758
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are also enough</font>

637
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,529
a group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

638
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,730
problem the same way and that was the

639
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,710
dev ops group and so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

640
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,350
citing some slides by John all spa who

641
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">was the VP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Operations net slicker and</font>

642
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,129
James wicket who is one of our

643
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,200
illustrious leaders here I'll tell you a

644
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,880
little about rugged DevOps DevOps and

645
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,730
rugged DevOps and how I'm trying to

646
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,820
contribute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that movement how many</font>

647
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,620
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here are familiar with DevOps</font>

648
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,879
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five percent okay so DevOps</font>

649
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,439
started when John alspaugh gave a

650
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,480
presentation at the velocity<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>

651
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,399
so that's where the internet online

652
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,889
service companies hang out now so yahoo

653
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:26,479
google linkedin they all hang out there

654
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:28,699
right they gave this presentation human

655
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,889
he was vp of ops at flickr that ciroc

656
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,480
the world he said yeah we are now at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

657
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:34,668
point we're doing ten deploys a day

658
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,370
right and we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this by having dev</font>

659
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,990
and ops work together right and so and

660
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,209
he sort of really painted beautifully

661
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,580
kind of the tension<font color="#CCCCCC"> between dev and</font>

662
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,580
operations so dev is embodied by Spock

663
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,199
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scotty and embodying</font>

664
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,699
operations right and we're security in

665
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,740
this security sort of like the red

666
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,090
shirted secure the red shirted security

667
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,039
guy who goes down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way party is</font>

668
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,779
always killed right so you know with the

669
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if you talking about if you look in</font>

670
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:03,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps community you'll find a</font>

671
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:06,139
prevailing thinking that says you know

672
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,639
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group of people where ops can</font>

673
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:09,139
think like dev and dev can think like

674
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:11,149
ops right and there's a whole sort of

675
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:14,059
set of red herrings about DevOps is

676
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:16,668
getting rid of ops like no ops right and

677
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,110
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that is really a red herring I</font>

678
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,000
think DevOps is more about putting ops

679
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,979
and security to dev than it is putting

680
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,009
dev and secure dev<font color="#E5E5E5"> pudding bring dev</font>

681
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,169
into security nops but it is a sort of

682
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:28,789
amazing sort of culture where you have

683
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,679
Devon ops harmoniously living together

684
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,759
right and actually breaking kind of

685
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,399
these silos where you're getting

686
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,809
phenomenal feature flow of encode and

687
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:38,178
environments into production right with

688
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,639
phenomenal results incidentally the

689
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,899
state of the art now right I amazon they

690
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,120
gave a presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we are now</font>

691
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:45,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing like one deploy every 9 seconds</font>

692
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,719
right it's not for their cloud customers

693
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:50,389
this is for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon enterprise right</font>

694
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's a thousand deploys a day so</font>

695
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:54,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">dev ops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think is just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very promising</font>

696
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,379
place for security practitioners get

697
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,879
plugged into and james wicket worked

698
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,649
with a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who are they are</font>

699
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,500
coining his term rugged<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps which i</font>

700
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,270
absolutely

701
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of right is basically saying hey let's</font>

702
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,680
take the DevOps mentality right and add

703
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,629
rugged attributes to it so that secured

704
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,480
it just becomes one mother one other set

705
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,100
up facet of quality right and integrate

706
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,880
that into the daily development and

707
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:20,669
operational processes so the people who

708
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:28,680
developed rugged as a concept is like

709
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">Josh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> corpsman Jim yeah I oh it's in my</font>

710
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,110
slide somewhere but is there an

711
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,969
incredible sort of I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think sort of a</font>

712
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,040
leap that they made that said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

713
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,140
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the best way to</font>

714
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,570
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrate security into every</font>

715
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,180
domain of work and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sort of the</font>

716
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">rugged did ities right it's like our</font>

717
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,900
goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make applications and</font>

718
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,950
infrastructure that's available survival

719
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,380
defensible securable longevity able and

720
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,810
portable right uh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that and</font>

721
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,540
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a way that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to our</font>

722
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,909
peers in QA development architecture

723
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,649
right to actually recognize that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

724
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,850
a lot of expertise that we can bring to

725
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,460
bear to help them achieve all these

726
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,260
goals which security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just one right</font>

727
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,580
and my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with the</font>

728
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,840
DevOps community is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these guys are</font>

729
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,040
ready to have conversations with you

730
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,439
right if you can help achieve that

731
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,100
objective right we have a lot to offer

732
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,000
and my proof of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

733
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,120
start working with these internet

734
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,920
companies like yahoo AOL and Microsoft

735
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,179
the sponsors and the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised</font>

736
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,770
their hand first came from very

737
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,470
surprising space the VP<font color="#CCCCCC"> of development</font>

738
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,780
right at AOL is a gentleman named Eric

739
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">passmore who later became the CTO had</font>

740
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">1300 developers working for him and when</font>

741
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,649
he saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of feedback slide he</font>

742
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,720
said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have put your</font>

743
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,460
finger on one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest problems</font>

744
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right these aren't operational problems</font>

745
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,750
these are my problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said you</font>

746
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we view that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we recognize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

747
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I key operations and to lesser sent</font>

748
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,210
security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bottleneck right we can</font>

749
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,370
complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code we can do the code</font>

750
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,720
commit but it still takes too long for

751
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,030
operations and get the environments

752
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,250
ready right so you know code from it

753
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,620
then begins a two-month long deployment

754
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,940
process which is way too long because

755
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,500
environments are never available when we

756
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,100
need them and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> never I'll never</font>

757
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,600
working correctly the first time and you

758
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,040
know when we do release it causes a

759
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,149
global disruption whether it's because

760
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an outage or security</font>

761
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:20,998
a issue that needs to be remediated and

762
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,009
you know the collective accumulation of

763
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:25,649
technical debt drives up our deployment

764
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:27,889
times and what was sort of like one of

765
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:30,658
my biggest surprises he said when

766
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:32,070
operations can't deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> environments</font>

767
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,799
fast enough in other words when we can't

768
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,989
get to the Linux<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 colonel to the 26</font>

769
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,309
kernel for six months that was like

770
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:39,989
basically a work stoppage for

771
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:41,460
development for six months right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

772
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:43,889
they had so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many features that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were real</font>

773
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,869
I reliant upon multi-threaded kernels

774
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so he said it was just like you</font>

775
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,320
know I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have given my developers</font>

776
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,029
vacations right for six months that's a

777
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,218
bit of an exaggeration but when he

778
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:54,929
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> the impact of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to his job</font>

779
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:56,690
suddenly he stepped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you know</font>

780
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:59,549
what what can I do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will give</font>

781
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:00,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">resources staff you have my attention I</font>

782
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:02,279
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help from an information</font>

783
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:06,210
security perspective you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

784
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:09,269
better thing to hear than that so what

785
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">does these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks dudes look like you</font>

786
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:11,969
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to cut off I'm</font>

787
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,769
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> two books</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one out one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

788
00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">was called a DevOps cookbook right and</font>

789
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:16,950
the goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to capture and codify</font>

790
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,928
how do you start and finish DevOps

791
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,570
transformations I think a critical piece

792
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is how do does information</font>

793
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,080
security integrate into the development

794
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,749
processes when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a deploy a</font>

795
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,418
day right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing a security</font>

796
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:32,129
review and it takes two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

797
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,139
know that there's a to order of

798
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:36,209
magnitude mismatch in cycle times right

799
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:38,668
you know how do you know how do we keep

800
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,200
up with those deployment rights so while

801
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:41,669
and then how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get operations to</font>

802
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,589
get ready right how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

803
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,469
operations driven to the earliest part

804
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:47,639
of you know the agile<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sprint's right so</font>

805
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:50,639
we're developing code and the

806
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,498
environments at the same time so in my

807
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:55,168
mind right we're reframing IT operations

808
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:57,269
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be not just controlling on plan to</font>

809
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:59,580
work like we discussed invisible ops but

810
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,559
really how do we move planned work right

811
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,299
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you increase Flo's plan work from</font>

812
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,869
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> into production and almost</font>

813
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,700
treating it like a factory plant floor

814
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:10,738
and you know is this consistent with

815
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,789
visible I think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really is exactly</font>

816
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:14,009
everything that we didn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

817
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:15,330
invisible offices how do you treat

818
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:16,799
planned work make sure that we know

819
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what needs to be worked on any</font>

820
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,339
given time and where is securities<font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font>

821
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:25,440
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the IT general controls so I</font>

822
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:28,109
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned this to pride isn't</font>

823
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,280
working one is the DevOps cookbook and

824
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,740
the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

825
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,750
the team is Patrick Dubois he's the

826
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,970
founder of the DevOps movement the

827

gentleman named John Willis who was VP

830
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,330
shingo prize winner for his contribution

831
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the lean body of research and the</font>

832
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,600
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> here really is you know how do we</font>

833
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,600
prescrip they show what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does deb need to</font>

834
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,429
do security and ops to match the

835
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,290
outcomes that are being shown by people

836
00:28:53,430 --> 00:29:01,110
like flickr<font color="#E5E5E5"> google and so forth I'm</font>

837
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to briefly go through the DevOps</font>

838
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,870
part just can't give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flavor of</font>

839
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:08,700
what it looks like so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pilots</font>

840
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,080
and by the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> earnest hopefully this</font>

841
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,150
will resonate with you and James because

842
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,220
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't we have some rewriting to</font>

843
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,990
do but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the step one is</font>

844
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,330
like having one person own the value

845
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,220
change from dev tops and also owning<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

846
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,020
security responsibilities right so they

847
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,940
have one place<font color="#CCCCCC"> where all those things</font>

848
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,020
meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you can d conflict and make</font>

849
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure the right feedback loops are</font>

850
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,040
happening secondly the notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dev</font>

851
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,390
and ops are now working together from

852
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,840
the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning right you take your</font>

853
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:36,630
most senior ops person typically in you

854
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calling the prints right</font>

855
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,770
brent is a person you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix almost</font>

856
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">every major outage right and the brent</font>

857
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:45,240
gets hit by bus write all work stops or

858
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,280
if that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> brent hasn't been on</font>

859
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,700
vacation you take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> brent and you put</font>

860
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,700
them into the dev team right and their

861
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,470
goal is to in very beginning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

862
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the early sprints now i'm going</font>

863
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have code that is ready to be</font>

864
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,800
deployed but environments to deploy into

865
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,090
in other words never again<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we be at</font>

866
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,590
the end of the project where dev is

867
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">eating up all the time leaving no time</font>

868
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:08,280
for operations and security right you'll

869
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">always have something that we can deploy</font>

870
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,520
that will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the dev environment</font>

871
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:13,590
will become the<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue environment when</font>

872
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,330
we come this staging and test and then

873
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,770
production environment right was I think

874
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,189
a huge breakthrough in terms of the way

875
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:21,870
Devon code are developed now in parallel

876
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,370
secondly here you take that ops person

877
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,570
embed them into the dev structure right

878
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:27,120
where they can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position</font>

879
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">and incidentally and a security person</font>

880
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,290
to describe what operations and security

881
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,210
needs in production right to support the

882
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,159
monitoring objectives to support the

883
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,260
deployment objectives so they become

884
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,400
just like another stakeholder in dev but

885
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,650
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a very special kind</font>

886
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of special power right they can sort of</font>

887
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,159
pull the andon cord in the toilet

888
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,418
production plants right the expectation

889
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,220
is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something goes wrong you stop</font>

890
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:49,779
the entire assembly line and you fix the

891
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,149
issue at the source you never pass it on

892
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">downstream right the Dobson security</font>

893
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:56,439
person in the dev structure has that

894
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,350
special responsibility right to make

895
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,860
sure that we never incur technical debt

896
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:05,080
unintentionally and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow</font>

897
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,149
you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many here</font>

898
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,918
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations where you're</font>

899
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:13,268
using it some sort of agile dev process

900
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">ah yeah so you know typically in my</font>

901
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:18,610
experience beyond the dev<font color="#E5E5E5"> sprints the</font>

902
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:19,899
Sprint's or like the work periods you

903
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,510
know at the end of every sprint is

904
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:25,000
typically one or two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> long um you</font>

905
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:27,129
know if you actually are doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

906
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,870
job you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually deploy more in</font>

907
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,429
shorter intervals in the sprints right

908
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,979
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be releasing new feature</font>

909
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,029
sets once every two<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks but you might</font>

910
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">even give the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the option of</font>

911
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:37,029
being able to decouple and deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

912
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">day right then so all sorts of options</font>

913
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:41,110
become possible right then you can now

914
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,370
even start this organization we're

915
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,750
observing that goes from a sprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

916
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,209
convent where it's like we can deploy it

917
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,429
will write and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

918
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">security being a necessary part of that</font>

919
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:51,730
the dropbox failure right where they

920
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,080
accidentally deployed something that

921
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,519
took down authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an entire</font>

922
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,470
weekend right that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

923
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,090
security failure right<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere in the</font>

924
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,710
deployment process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

925
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,539
forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn off a configuration flag</font>

926
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,630
right that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security showed</font>

927
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:06,700
never let happen and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

928
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,279
putting ops in the dev chain now we want

929
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put dev in the ops chain right yeah</font>

930
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,860
i'm not sure if we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give</font>

931
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,630
them daily access to the production

932
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment but you certainly they want</font>

933
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,279
to be you know they should be put very

934
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,600
you want to move them closer to the

935
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:21,850
front lines there's a great quote from

936
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the founder of mob browser he said</font>

937
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,990
waking up developers we found a 3am is a

938
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,519
great feedback loop right we found that

939
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,070
defects got fixed very very quickly

940
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,450
right and so there's obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

941
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,399
separation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> duty issues that need to</font>

942
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,529
be worked out there but the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

943
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,689
is that you can fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more quickly</font>

944
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:39,610
right and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> includes security</font>

945
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,080
vulnerabilities right how great<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

946
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,908
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait three three</font>

947
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">months right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before it to be fixed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

948
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:48,549
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed the next day right I</font>

949
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,408
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the promise so just I'll</font>

950
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:53,080
talk briefly about the expected outcomes

951
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:56,380
of what it looks like for the business

952
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,360
to successfully put in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

953
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,180
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about creating determinism</font>

954
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,129
and repeatability in the deployment

955
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,650
process where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find sort of another</font>

956
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,900
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of key little win a quick Wayne is</font>

957
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,370
moving packaging responsibility from ops

958
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,380
2 development we find that this is a

959
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">great point where that becomes you know</font>

960
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,220
committed in the repository is a great

961
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,070
place for security to do the reviews on

962
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,770
and it you know it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being now</font>

963
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,110
performed by people who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mastery</font>

964
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,550
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> reaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduced cycle time right</font>

965
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,409
of those deployments from say six hours

966
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:30,669
to 45 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did with</font>

967
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">AOL com</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> homepage right by doing these</font>

968
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,120
type of things putting in policy that

969
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,960
says hey whenever something doesn't

970
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,120
deploy cleanly from say dev to test test

971
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,890
the staging stage into production right

972
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,689
you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed forward you never sort</font>

973
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,220
of bang on it make it work you go all

974
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,600
the way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the end right and figure</font>

975
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,020
out what went wrong so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

976
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,820
again in the future right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

977
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,460
each one of those environment owners

978
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,409
whether it's dev test QA staging

979
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,540
production accountable for making sure

980
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the configurations and the</font>

981
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,440
environments are in the known good state

982
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,510
and those combination things seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

983
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,620
result in sort of the breakthroughs and

984
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,840
deployment times right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

985
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,520
development helps make the operational

986
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,639
environment or stable and makes it more

987
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,168
securable in the second part is really

988
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about increasing production rigor right</font>

989
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:17,799
how do you get operations in a mode

990
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,779
where they are properly elevate properly

991
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,610
elevating preventive projects

992
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,010
documenting all the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that can be</font>

993
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,899
audited and reviewed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their</font>

00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,179
correctly plugging in security when

995
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,918
they're doing their work how am i doing

996
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,879
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far is this resonating with you this</font>

997
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:37,089
seemed like a AA fairy tale that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

998
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,330
completely unappealing keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene</font>

999
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:43,120
thumbs<font color="#E5E5E5"> down is like go to lunch early</font>

1000
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:44,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right I'm passionate about the</font>

1001
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,449
stuff i love this i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a last</font>

1002
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,389
best hope for information security in

1003
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:50,589
fact let me tell you why the other book

1004
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm working on which is something I've</font>

1005
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,110
been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five years that just</font>

1006
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:59,050
is like oh it's called when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I he fails a</font>

1007
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,000
novel and I want this the goal of this

1008
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,590
project is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the business care to</font>

1009
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. information security</font>

1010
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,500
misinformation security what you are

1011
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,240
talking about is actually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

1012
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,860
biggest problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to tell me</font>

1013
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,299
more about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do about it you</font>

1014
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,430
know versus being marginalized

1015
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,530
and the book that this is modeled on is

1016
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,319
a book called the goal I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

1017
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">people it has anyone here read this book</font>

1019
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,010
most the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

1020
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,050
ever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written by a guy named dr.</font>

1021
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,730
le<font color="#CCCCCC"> goldratt right I've actually passed</font>

1022
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,640
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> this summer and he wrote this book</font>

1023
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,550
in 80s that was essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> a novel</font>

1024
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,529
about a plant manager who had to fix his

1025
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs and due date issues in 90 days</font>

1026
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,010
otherwise they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut the</font>

1027
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,320
plant down right and so you live the

1028
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">light nails through the eyes of Alex</font>

1029
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,000
right you see these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1030
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:48,009
human cost right and then you see as you

1031
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,410
know he as he questions some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the kids</font>

1032
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,480
that's a common wisdom and he realizes

1033
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,430
everything that he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1034
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,920
taking him away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the goal right and</font>

1035
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,339
for anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I would recommend this</font>

1036
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,750
book to anybody except for my wife who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1037
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,520
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to the book on tape one too</font>

1038
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,500
many times on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to the beach and</font>

1039
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,170
she won't listen let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me listen to it</font>

1040
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:12,280
anymore anyway so the goal by<font color="#CCCCCC"> le gold</font>

1041
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so in our book right um is a novel</font>

1042
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,850
right with two main characters the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO</font>

1043
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a four billion dollar-a-year company</font>

1044
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,680
and his name is Steve Palmer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font>

1045
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,960
masters and the second character is Bill

1046
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,609
Palmer the VP of IT operations who was

1047
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,440
recently promoted from being the

1048
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,060
director of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s400 operations who's</font>

1049
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,860
purposely you know tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

1050
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting promoted for eight years but</font>

1051
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,670
he's been selected right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO</font>

1052
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,410
continually says you know we're not

1053
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,640
Google we're not Microsoft it's-- not a

1054
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,500
core competency maybe we're just better

1055
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,299
off outsourcing the whole thing right

1056
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,980
that make all these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away but</font>

1057
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">he quickly learns that none of the</font>

1058
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,210
promises he's making to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board where</font>

1059
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,430
there's projects operations security

1060
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,310
compliance you know all of those things

1061
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,020
are completely reliant on having great

1062
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,440
IT right that you can't just outsource

1063
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,300
so here's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what happens to Bill</font>

1064
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,520
in the first couple of days the free

1065
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,160
opening scene is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEO being raked</font>

1066
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,390
over the coals by the board because he's

1067
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,799
missed every commitment that he's made

1068
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,049
and maybe they they take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1069
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,910
chairmanship and you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say maybe</font>

1070
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need someone younger you know in this</font>

1071
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,720
job someone who actually understands

1072
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,670
technology right and then so this causes

1073
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,950
great grief and so you promotes the fire

1074
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,600
the CIO and his VP of IT operations and

1075
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,720
enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new main character you know</font>

1076
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bill Palmer right is embodied by Gene</font>

1077
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,430
Kranz from Apollo through

1078
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,960
chain which i think is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

1079
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">embodiment what great office looks like</font>

1080
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,099
but here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bills first three days on the</font>

1081
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,480
job there's a crippling payroll outage

1082
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:33,460
where all the salaried employees got

1083
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,580
paid but no the hourlies right got the

1084
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,810
CFO put on the front<font color="#CCCCCC"> page of the news</font>

1085
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,549
secondly and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where it</font>

1086
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,770
came from right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now which one of the</font>

1087
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,880
million changes was it incidentally the

1088
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,560
person making a change was the

1089
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,020
information security people by pushing

1090
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,580
in a tokenization application which

1091
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,930
leads to a very uncomfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit</font>

1092
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,580
meeting where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that there was</font>

1093
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,710
950<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep general control deficiencies</font>

1094
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:58,029
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could lead to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a material</font>

1095
00:37:53,710 --> 00:38:00,190
finding and then finally you know some

1096
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:01,510
more reasons why I you know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you</font>

1097
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,460
know building he might have made the

1098
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,470
wrong decision taking a job the third

1099
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,820
thing right is when he entered you gets

1100
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,230
thrown under the bus by the VP of

1101
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,720
application development and the VP<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1102
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,400
Marketing the evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> sara moulton right</font>

1103
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,049
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey project Phoenix the most</font>

1104
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,180
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> project for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> company needs</font>

1105
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,910
deploy next week the operation is going

1106
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,618
operations people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are saying what next</font>

1107
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:24,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">week it was supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in next year</font>

1108
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,290
right but essentially they can't get in

1109
00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:29,470
the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment which results</font>

1110
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,730
in you know disaster including like when

1111
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:32,830
you go into this new online ordering

1112
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,180
website if you empty the shopping cart

1113

1114
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,410
including the credit card information

1115
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:42,730
and the stripe one the pan anyway so the

1116
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,529
goal of this book is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really to be like</font>

1117
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,960
the bridge between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business and IT</font>

1118
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,359
between dev ops and security to show

1119
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,740
that hey you know first the<font color="#CCCCCC"> goals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

1120
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,020
empathy so we know what it's like

1121
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,700
walking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other person's shoes right</font>

and help create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a collective will to</font>

1123
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,819
solve the problem i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was telling someone</font>

1124
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,259
earlier today the vision for this book

1125
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,910
really can't and was validated for me

1126
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,080
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cio of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> columbia sportswear said</font>

1127

need to read it the CFO and my boss's

1131
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,400

1132
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:16,140
that my mind right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is you</font>

1133
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,140

1136
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,630
about the most interesting character in

1137
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,160
the book for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me right he's not a main</font>

1138
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,820
character he's a secondary character but

1139
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:33,009
in my mind the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ciso is one of the most</font>

1140
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,650
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex people in the books</font>

for nine years he's 39 years old

1143

1146
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,510
realizes that uh you know he hasn't

1147
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,589
actually slept through the night well

1148

continually haunted by<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you know</font>

1150
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,900
nightmares that he can get thrown

1151
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,580
underneath the bus by the business right

1152
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,080
that he's gonna be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall guy when we</font>

1153
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,370
have a security breach or when we have

1154
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,620
nada finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to fail</font>

1155
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:03,020
miserably you know and that happened and

1156
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,819
he's realized that his self-image has

1157
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,200
suffered right in his mind he got into

1158
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security because he want to</font>

1159
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,980
help catch bad guys he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven by a</font>

1160
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,020
sense of duty right but he realizes that

1161
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,970
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way he feels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

1162
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,790
feels more like the guy from office

1163
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,339
space where<font color="#E5E5E5"> he sent to the basement no</font>

1164
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,960
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants him around right and you know</font>

1165
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,520
he feels a special sort of like

1166
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,470
humiliation when he has to beg the

1167
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,180
project managers to tell him where the

1168
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,370
dev developers are meeting because they

1169
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,750
won't tell him right uh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1170
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,400
he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing it for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1171
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,680
the organization and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good of our</font>

1172
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,900
customers right and so I you know his

1173
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,060
kids are gonna dad you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't seem</font>

1174
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,560
very happy and his wife says I you know

1175
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,170
you are not the man I fell in<font color="#CCCCCC"> love with</font>

1176
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,930
right you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate the person you've</font>

1177
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:47,510
become and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three</font>

1178
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:49,549
assumptions that John has to question

1179
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,740
right that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> holds very deeply and it</font>

1180
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,480
turns out that believing this actually

1181
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,189
leads them to the wrong decisions that

1182
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,640
make almost all the problems worse in

1183
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,470
dev ops and security the first one is

1184
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security wins based on</font>

1185
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,850
how much work we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT</font>

1186
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,680
system in other words the more budget we

1187
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,720
can get the more vulnerabilities we can

1188
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,399
get closed the more we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve bully</font>

1189
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,560
the line managers around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more of</font>

1190
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,670
that I can do the better off information

<font color="#CCCCCC">security and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goo and the</font>

1192
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,990
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what he learns</font>

1193
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,120
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of his issues</font>

1194
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,529
especially in the production<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

1195
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually just create more control</font>

1196
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,610
complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and production environment it</font>

1197
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,980
just is papering over sort of systemic

1198
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:30,320
problems and that he realizes his unique

1199
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,090
gift right is that he can understand so

1200
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,490
the business objectives how the business

1201
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,960
runs where the data flows where you have

1202
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,479
reliance placed on where you absolutely

1203
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">need control because there are no manual</font>

1204
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,990
controls that can catch security

1205
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,570
breaches or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some sort of error</font>

1206
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,339
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know he has a special power</font>

1207
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can shrink the scope of the</font>

1208
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,180
audits and reduced dramatically how much

1209
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,900
energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being spent on just compliance</font>

1210
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,180
and not making

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization secure the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he finds right is that another core</font>

1213
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,299
assumption that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> incorrect is that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">information security wins when it medals</font>

1215
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:02,960
with daily work right the more in badger

1216
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,000
developers on a daily basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> nor can</font>

1217

badger operations right the more we do

1218
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,299
that the more we went like this person

1219
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:11,119
served with a clipboard inspecting every

1220
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:12,500
work center in the plant and then you

1221
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,109
know he learns that so all these

1222
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,180
promises that he's kept with for

1223

developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop managers and</font>

1224
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,799
operations right it's just meaningless

00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:23,720
promises he learns that you know he is

1226
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:25,309
more like a plant safety officer who

1227
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,569
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking at individual work</font>

1230

that's where she should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be focusing on</font>

1232
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:37,130
and that he will use his unique skills

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the development managers and the</font>

expense of dev and operations in other

1244
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:04,578
words it's like a zero-sum game and he

1245
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,339
comes to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by putting in things</font>

other words the organization gets so

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,750
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more work done there's more</font>

calories around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody and so</font>

1251
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,470
operation becomes more able to deploy

1252
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,118
and put in infrastructure improvement

1253
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,649
projects development<font color="#E5E5E5"> release rates go</font>

from quarterly to three times<font color="#E5E5E5"> daily and</font>

1255
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:26,029
we all agree that the team all agree is

1256
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,299
at ten percent of all ops and dev

1257
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:30,650
psychol should be spent on improvement

1258

programs of which security<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get a</font>

1259
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,730
big chunk right and that means security

1260
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:38,089
objectives are now being done by dev and

1261
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,980
operations not<font color="#E5E5E5"> purely by one person so</font>

00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,180
and the goal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and the goal is to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">replicate the performance or seen in</font>

00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,720
high performers right they have security

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,400
built into the process of which means

1266
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,359
great compliance great security great

1267
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,160
operations and great development

1268
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,038
throughput as well so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> John so John at the end is a person</font>
