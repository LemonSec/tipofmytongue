of trope a theme here with the pitfall

66
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,480
game the classic arcade game so what

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,579
kind of do a game manual thing try to

68
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,290
try to set the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stage we'll talk about</font>

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,600
the premise of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game some treasures</font>

70
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,340
and pitfalls that you'll encounter as

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,959
you as you implement a maturity model

72
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,459
and software security and software

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,930
assurance and then we'll kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talk</font>

74
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,690
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we go from there once this</font>

75
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,310
particular game is over a scattering did

76
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background so there you go I'm Phil</font>

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,870
that's Scott and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> T EA from a</font>

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,089
background because that is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

79
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,280
stage I'm setting here so I'm the

80
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,769
information security officer ta ta is

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,660
about 700 employees right now we work

the state who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our primary audience</font>

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,980
educators and and students in those in

85
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">that space and so that's five million</font>

86
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,329
student records now and a lot of

87
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,209
historical student records that we care

88
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:30,769
about right so weird a te a start we had

89
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,120
we have an application security program

90
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,519
when I came in the door I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,400
minutes position for 11 months is again

92
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,049
another piece of background<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have some</font>

93
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,420
policies and procedures around this kind

94
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,060
of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how mature they are</font>

95
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,640
how how complex they are is an

96
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,380
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> question and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we had</font>

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,779
some initial training around the group

98
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,430
and some exposure to security concepts

99
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,750
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I walked in the door application</font>

100
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,760
security was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not completely unknown</font>

101
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,110
right so that's an important concept if

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,790
it is completely unknown in your

103
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,960
organization that's a different starting

104
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">point than where I</font>

105
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,120
I started from also traditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> at te</font>

106
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,540
a there's a historic there's a siloed

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,830
approach and so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

108
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,989
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> groups are doing their</font>

109
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,700
own thing right okay sometimes they're

110
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,370
talking to each other sometimes they're

111
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,620
working together but traditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

112
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,090
is a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> where development teams</font>

113
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,140
are doing their thing together and the

114
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,159
other development team is doing their

115
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing together that's not necessarily</font>

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
bad it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's the state of</font>

117
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,800
the situation when I walked in the door

118
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,540
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the case anymore</font>

119
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,850
because you guys may or may not know

120
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,270
that the state's fiscal year turned over

121
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,800
so we lost a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of funds and but when I</font>

122
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,330
walked in the door we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had outsourcing</font>

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,830
for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so our software</font>

124
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,260
security was primarily an outsourced

125
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,210
activity to both then improve which you

126
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,039
know Scott was is a part of and we also

127
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,690
we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verrico tool to do a lot of</font>

128
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,860
our software security these are key

129
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,410
points about where we're starting

130
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you have to realize that te a</font>

131
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,070
had something in place before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move</font>

132
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,219
into a maturity model and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing</font>

133
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:02,080
our program<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you have nothing in</font>

134
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,510
place that's a different starting point

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,760
so where can you start and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

136
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,230
I'm saying here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suggesting that</font>

137
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,300
establishing an application security

138
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,850
program doesn't necessarily begin with a

139
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,170
maturity model<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there are a lot of</font>

other folks talking about Software

141

application security software security

144
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,950
techniques those are great<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

145
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,409
know about it and deal with but getting

146
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,810
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font>

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,660
first few steps and we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak</font>

150
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,280
to that you do and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of step</font>

151
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,540
1<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have a champion a lot of</font>

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,130
the folks in this room are that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

153
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,360
champion but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do have to have</font>

154
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,159
somebody that could start talking this

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,840
sucker up you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in the door</font>

156
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,060
and say here some software requirements

157
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,710
here's here's our maturity model level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

158
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,000
let's start doing this you have to have

159
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,609
somebody who can who can really talk

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,729
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of thing I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> argue</font>

161
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,349
eloquently and and

162
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:01,930
um and uh you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh gosh I'm flubbing</font>

163
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:04,058
here on finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word but charismatic</font>

164
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allah right i mean you need somebody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

165
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:08,529
can talk you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the</font>

166
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:11,229
whole team gets that the whole stack of

167
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,879
the team managers and executives to some

168
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,159
extent right but all the way down

169
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,080
developers testers security folks not

170
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,240
just your security folks need to get

171
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay developers and testers and</font>

172
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,509
again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks today or talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

173
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of thing well we really want</font>

174
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:27,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into and so that's kind of where</font>

175
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:29,889
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting started here is having a</font>

176
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">roadmap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so once once you get started</font>

177
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,879
here you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a plan</font>

178
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:37,059
moving forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where open Sam</font>

179
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:39,129
can be one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay another</font>

180
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:42,099
show of hands here who is either working

181
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:46,360
through open Sam besom or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's</font>

182
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,710
sdl anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so not not not not</font>

183
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,469
half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room maybe a third of the room</font>

184
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,330
or so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a that's a good stage</font>

185
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,770
is set because maturity model is not

186
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,620
necessarily something you're you're

187
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,438
familiar with as a whole but that's

188
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so kinda as we get started here</font>

189
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna I'm gonna hand it over Scott</font>

190
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,959
here to talk a bit more in depth about

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,819
what open Sam is it is to set that game

192
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,680
annual stage well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>

193
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:13,529
bill as with any game or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

194
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,879
has structured rules you have a manual

195
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,979
pitfall<font color="#E5E5E5"> poking how to use the controller</font>

196
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,909
how to jump over alligators swing on the

197
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:25,389
rope and what we did when denim group

198
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,430
came in to assess the software security

199
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,490
excuse me software development<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifecycle</font>

200
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,499
at the Texas Education Agency we did so

201
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,919
with an eye to established standards and

202
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,650
our manual that we went in with with

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">phil's agreement and</font>

204
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,380
and support was the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam standards</font>

205
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,389
what Phil is talking about needing a

206
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,669
champion I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the term palliative</font>

207
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:51,419
because you can have an evangelist or a

208
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,549
champion<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a paladin has the tools the</font>

209
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:56,190
sword<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the shield to cut through</font>

210
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,440
whatever has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be cut group and they</font>

211
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,330
have the charisma<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it so I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,669
think it Phil as the Paladin over at

213
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,460
Texas Education Agency for and this

214
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:13,139
right here the manual this is what we're

215
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:16,109
talking about really well you know so

216
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,470
the manual breaks it down into four

217
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,479
large business functions that that

218
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,490
relate directly to elements of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

219
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">software development lifecycle</font>

220
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,900
governance construction verification and

221
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,430
deployment and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cute</font>

222
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,469
little icons I don't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

223
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,469
derogatorily they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool little</font>

224
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,479
icons for governance constructions a

225
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,099
hammer and the wrench verification

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,289
making sure everything works the way you

227
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,060
think it should and then deployment

228
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,919
getting it out into your operational

229
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,209
environment and just to just to

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,980
interject you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the color</font>

231
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,390
here but the governance of blue

232
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,190
constructions kind of orange the

233
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,550
verifications green deployments red

234
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,020
obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizer the the authors</font>

235
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,760
of open Sam did a fairly good job of

236
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,589
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ad a compliant because you</font>

237
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,089
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know that bit that</font>

238
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,250
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those had colors but you know</font>

239
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,330
it's pretty you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's got some color</font>

240
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,910
in it so what we started with the the

241
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,850
large business functions can be broken

242
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,459
down into the security practices and

243
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,400
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three security practices in each</font>

244
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,469
of the business functions in governance

245
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,910
we have strategy and metrics policy and

246
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,490
compliance and then education and

247
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,800
guidance in construction threat

248
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,360
assessment security requirements

249
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,709
architecture and so on down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

250
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,250
each of these areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an area for</font>

251
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">improvement and using the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open Sam</font>

252
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,880
framework you start on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scale of 0 to 3</font>

253
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,370
3 being the most mature level of the

254
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,540
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 being we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything</font>

255
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:53,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular topic and so going</font>

256
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,680
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maturity work one of the first</font>

257
00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that we did was look at as an</font>

258
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,849
organization the overall strengths and

259
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:06,130
weaknesses in these areas across the

260
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:10,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire application portfolio using some</font>

261
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,649
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the open sanam project make</font>

262
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,660
public for their website<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case it</font>

263
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,850
was a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with

264
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,069
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool calculations we can go</font>

265
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,110
into all of the questions and assertions

266
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,220
that build that spreadsheet later on if

267
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,829
you'd like to it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fascinating</font>

to find your development your QA your

management project managers and your

274
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:43,359
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so open Sam being the for</font>

275
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,760
thoughtful organization that they are

276
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,199
put together a set of templates based on

277

the different types of industries<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,110
that we use

281
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,750
at the Texas Education Agency was based

282
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,750
specifically for government

283
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,519
organizations and it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

284
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">tough to tell with the colored radiation</font>

285
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,509
but here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is broken</font>

286
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into six phases and everywhere</font>

287
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:18,380
there's an intersection of the phase and

288
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:20,690
the level of security discipline that's

289
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,329
what you work on during that phase so

290
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,480
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example during the first phase we</font>

291
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:28,180
mostly worked on governance activity

292
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,370
strategy metrics policy and compliance

293
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,449
education and guidance and at the end of

294
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:40,160
phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> one those three disciplines have</font>

295
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:42,589
gone from a zero to one that means the

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,380
organization has more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

297
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:48,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular activity and throughout</font>

298
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout the template you see</font>

299
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:55,490
these things coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in chunks where</font>

300
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:58,639
you focus on one aspect with other parts

301
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,899
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdlc getting some love so you</font>

302
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,610
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just spend all of your time</font>

303
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:03,350
working on compliance at the very

304
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,410
beginning and nothing on construction

305
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,660
until the end so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where te a</font>

306
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,230
decided to start the early levels phase

307
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,350
1 phase 2 getting to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game phase</font>

308
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,690
2 racking up some points you know you're

309
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,940
you're hitting some you're hitting some

310
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,860
treasures you have found opportunities

311
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,180
for improvement using the framework

312
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,709
phase 3 you're hitting your stride you

313
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:33,229
have engaged across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization and</font>

314
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:36,319
everybody by phase 3 knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

315
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,260
security activities going on and by then

316
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:43,550
they should know what their role in the

317
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:47,089
particular assurance model is face for

318
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,719
bigger treasures deeper pits further

319
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,970
along you go you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> elevated awareness</font>

320
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,449
and now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deeper understanding</font>

321
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,470
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt you and so</font>

322
00:12:55,449 --> 00:13:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have now a greater obligation</font>

323
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address those things across the</font>

324
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,060
entire organization yes sir are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

325
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:09,120
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> faces to gauging from say levels</font>

326
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,390
viewers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the level one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or yes exactly</font>

327
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,340
by the end of each in phase like for

328
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">example on level one assuming that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

329
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,480
start at zero by the end of level one

330
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,820
you will have gone from a zero to a one

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,280
and strategy metrics policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance</font>

332
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,680
and education and guidance where is here

333
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,870
for example code<font color="#E5E5E5"> review you don't even</font>

334
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,260
touch code review activities in phase

335
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,630
one but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of Phase two your</font>

336
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,850
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be at a level one for</font>

337
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:37,500
code review or that particular

338
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,910
application group right it's an

339
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,560
additional example and operational

340
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">enabling for mr. princeston so when</font>

341
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,569
we're engaging our we're engaging our

342
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,460
our deployment teams are our operations

343
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,470
teams etc and some of those activities

344
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're waiting for quite a while until</font>

345
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rest of our program is mature more</font>

346
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,130
mature before we even engage them in

347
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,870
some of those capacities so it is a

348
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,090
follow-up<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a key point just as</font>

349
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,660
we're going forward here so for business

350
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,310
functions three uh fraud through three

351
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,160
activities in each function 12 things

352
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:10,140
total it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

353
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,870
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here that we're not working on</font>

354
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,069
everything right<font color="#CCCCCC"> away you really are not</font>

355
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,930
going to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right away</font>

356
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,030
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just a recommendation I</font>

357
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:21,209
would offer that's a requirement to even

358
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,560
do this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you will fail right</font>

359
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,280
at the beginning if you try to do it all

360
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,099
at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um and again I</font>

361
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,560
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is valid to comment that that</font>

362
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:35,160
this particular template works for us or

363
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,349
is working for us everybody doesn't do

364
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,120
it the same way right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean it and you</font>

365
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,620
and you know open<font color="#E5E5E5"> same has its templates</font>

366
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,850
but I mean make your own you know I mean

367
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you well know I really want to do</font>

368
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,050
operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> email right away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because my</font>

369
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,790
organization already is mature we just

370
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,650
need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few ducks in a row to say</font>

371
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,120
we're mature so to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to a report</font>

372
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,560
that we're mature but we're already

373
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,760
doing some of those things why not do it

374
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,920
quicker right so yeah you know it it's

375
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,189
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which organizations doing</font>

376
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,500
however the key takeaway is that no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

377
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,339
should or can do it all at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

378
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,189
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away right</font>

379
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,319
okay well but no no oh that's the other

380
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,699
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> sees Yeah Yeah right then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hominis</font>

381
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,860
understanding well<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep said that was</font>

382
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting right i mean no no I know</font>

383
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,470
but but I so I was sitting in Michael

384
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Harvard how was talking about have been</font>

385
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to see</font>

386
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,720
him talk through the history of all of

387
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because that implementation was a</font>

388
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,980
rather gradual process and I think this

389
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same this is the same idea same</font>

390
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,170
thing that that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll get</font>

391
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,850
to it with year that that you kind of

392
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,498
start with some governance ideas and

393
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,879
then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into real some meat and but</font>

394
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,740
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to some governance I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do you</font>

395
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,910
know you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hot back and</font>

396
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,910
forth yeah

397
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,579
we picked three of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 objectives as</font>

398
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,180
our first phase and all those thing you

399
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:54,060
got six<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get you in bubble wanna drive</font>

400
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,069
but right yeah yeah so how did you come

401
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,859
have you choose those six<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus out</font>

402
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,269
well for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

403
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,079
of actually quick answer and we can we

404
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:06,000
can we can move on um I basically took

405
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
open sans recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> opens him said</font>

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,060
this for governor is a shins I looked at

407
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,019
it it seemed reasonable based on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

408
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,758
the activities we were already doing

409
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:14,790
didn't seem like it would fail so I

410
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:23,519
decided to try all four right you're

411
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:24,810
gonna do maybe some more yeah so oh so

412
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,790
the thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember at the beginning</font>

413
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,709
of the of the program of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of</font>

414
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,990
maturation process it's not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

415
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect security program at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font>

416
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,040
beginning it's about starting with

417
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,649
structure start with structure the rest

418
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">will follow and don't start with tools</font>

419
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,990
don't start with you I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would add that</font>

420
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:44,670
don't start with tools so so they're a

421
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,079
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe talking I</font>

422
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't been in all the talks folks may</font>

423
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about using particular</font>

424
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,660
software security tools or doing this

425
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,609
kind of testing or this or that and

426
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,529
mostly these days software security

427
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,240
testing take some sort of scanning tool

428
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,100
if that's what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting with</font>

429
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,829
that's what your program is beginning

430
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,240
with III don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to get</font>

431
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,980
very far I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're gonna have to go</font>

432
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,339
back to a step one that's that's a step

433
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">two if you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so really um we</font>

434
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,198
talked a little about this but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

435
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,309
say before we begin that that uh whether

436
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,140
you realize it or not you're already on

437
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road to maturity okay kind of to get</font>

438
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">this game here at has started you may be</font>

439
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,169
at level zero but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game has</font>

440
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,750
started because all of us have<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

441
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know either an implicit or an explicit</font>

442
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,669
requirement to ask your software and it

443
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,168
may be implicit until you get hacked or

444
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:32,850
until you already tell you how about you

445
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,070
have a breach then it's now an explicit

446
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,899
requirement but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as you have</font>

447
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,280
sensitive data you have a requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

448
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,409
have that software secure whether you

449
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,879
realize it or not short coats do not

450
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,070
exist in implementing a maturity model

451
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,539
any maturity model sorry there are no

452
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,939
cheat codes there is no invincibility

453
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,559
star for Mario and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can jump go</font>

454
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,020
through everything there's no god mode

455
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,820
like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sorry like yeah</font>

456
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,070
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

457
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,139
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's obvious and the premise</font>

458
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,120
for this talk is that there are things

459
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are hard are things you know that</font>

460
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can run into their difficult and</font>

461
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,620
we're calling the pitfalls and there are

462
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to provide even</font>

463
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,419
bigger rewards a lot obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

464
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,950
move through a maturity model there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

465
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,320
rewards to your program because you're

466
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:17,310
growing towards maturity but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,870
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a suggestion is that there are</font>

468
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,250
things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more rewarding some</font>

469
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,310
things that are big wins at certain

470
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,210
levels certain areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's let's</font>

471
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:30,179
get started moving through those things

472
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:32,850
the the treasures in kind of the first

473
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,320
phase and and we kind of did try to

474
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,850
think us to keep track so you didn't

475
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to remember that that nifty goal</font>

476
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,050
you know roadmap template that we put up

477
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,240
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what's going on phase</font>

478
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">one you see that we're doing three</font>

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,750
governance things and moving them up to

480
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,700
level one and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one</font>

481
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,890
construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and one verification</font>

482
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,520
thing so there you go if you have if you

483
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,870
don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what those with those</font>

484
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,670
abbreviations are for just ask if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

485
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,320
curious but basically that's the idea

486
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we'll kind of lay that out so I</font>

487
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,840
didn't have to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it</font>

488
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,330
and and there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

489
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,800
treasure in phase one when you're

490
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,590
beginning this thing if you can really

491
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it done and it's hard is it's</font>

492
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,490
getting a map<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay by that I mean a</font>

493
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">roadmap and and really what's what's</font>

494
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,330
going on here you have a very powerful

495
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,550
organizational tool you now have

496
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,710
something that if you do it right can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

497
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,570
bought in and multiple levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

498
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,480
organization executive on down through

499
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,250
you know program management in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

500
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,050
software development areas and your team

501
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,360
so your team leads all the way through

502
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the through the stack folks realize we</font>

503
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,379
are going somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

504
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">anywhere we're going somewhere in</font>

505
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,640
particular okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a map it's</font>

506
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,500
not necessarily perfect right you may

507
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,540
pick a template you may decide to start

508
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,010
with three things you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with</font>

509
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,389
to decide to start with five things you

510
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,850
made it starters decide to start with

511
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,110
all 12 for whatever reason okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

512
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">may have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great and it may or it may</font>

513
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">not have been it may be it may succeed</font>

514
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,129
it may fail but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

515
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,690
a map and that is a powerful tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

516
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:01,519
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can get you where</font>

517
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:05,269
you're going that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the biggest</font>

518
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,950
treasure of this whole darn thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

519
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:08,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will see that that some of the</font>

520
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,820
biggest treasures are at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

521
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:14,090
beginning of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process because</font>

522
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,559
they'll they'll really rocket you

523
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,908
through that maturity that that process

524
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:21,559
of moving to me to maturity now

525
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,879
dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a map is you got</font>

526
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:24,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use it and if you don't people are</font>

527
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hold you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it especially if</font>

528
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,529
you do get buy-in throughout the or

529
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,908
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization now you're</font>

530
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:30,950
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little Running Room here too</font>

531
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:33,769
that's kind of another treasure in the

532
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,239
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase like an again pitfall you</font>

533
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,730
know it's difficult if you walk into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

534
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:39,470
level and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the the lake is right</font>

535
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,200
there you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can't like back</font>

536
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,029
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to run you know practice</font>

537
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,559
doing your jumps at the beginning in the

538
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,669
early levels the early levels are always

539
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,309
easing these games writing all these

540
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,720
platformer games anything their levels

541
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:53,090
are really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one little bad</font>

542
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,700
guy right one little easy obstacle to

543
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,980
overcome and to some extent that is the

544
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,720
case here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's you what will come</font>

545
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,960
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide about that but to</font>

546
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,279
some extent this is a situation where

547
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,440
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> started you've got a lot of</font>

548
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,179
tools available to you there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

549
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,220
resources their questionnaires or other

550
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:14,119
things you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to get this process</font>

551
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:18,529
moving so those are good things and so

552
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:20,869
with treasures you have pitfalls the

553
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:24,919
thing to remember at the very beginning

554
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:27,109
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll notice there's a focus on</font>

555
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:30,409
governance at the very beginning so that

556
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:32,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">people know what they should know now</font>

557
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:34,549
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a government structure at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

558
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,769
beginning can be overwhelming because

559
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:38,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">you there may be a tendency to document</font>

560
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,700
too much or to try and create<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies</font>

561
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,739
for things that haven't been fully

562
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,179
examined yet so setting up a governance

563
00:21:42,739 --> 00:21:46,759
organization or government

564
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:47,290
infrastructure can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> overwhelming at</font>

565
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:49,420
the beginning

566
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:53,800
and that's why you want to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down</font>

567
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:55,960
into smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> chunks now you know based</font>

568
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your map that there will be pitfalls</font>

569
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,890
you can't stand<font color="#CCCCCC"> still you started this</font>

570
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:06,610
you've got to keep moving but inertia is

571
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:09,310
tough building up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the momentum to keep a</font>

572
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,990
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> going at the very beginning can</font>

573
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,740
be very difficult because now you're

575
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,930
different areas of your sdlc all across

576
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,510
the board you're hitting it very early

577
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get things moving</font>

578
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,320
trying to get all those people lined up

579
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,740
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction and then moving</font>

580
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,830
towards a goal can be tough also just

581
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,030
determining who should play identifying

582
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,409
the correct people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to correct</font>

583
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,000
stakeholders from each of those of

584
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,390
organization each of those business

585
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,800
functions is critically important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

586
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,920
you have to have representation across

587
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,290
the organization because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

588
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">be working on every part of the</font>

589
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,830
organization so finding the right people

590
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to play is sometimes can be kind of hard</font>

591
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,530
but in these organizations if you're

592
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,300
lucky enough to have a fairly structured

593
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,700
organization those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump out</font>

594
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,330
at you the senior project managers to

595
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:10,060
senior QA team the iASO can help

596
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,240
organize everybody so that you're

597
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,889
pointing in the same direction so now

598
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,440
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you started you've gotten a couple</font>

599
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">of treasures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've hit phase</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one you</font>

600
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,570
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules and you've got a</font>

601
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,590
roadmap so phase two wrapping up some

602
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,120
points this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you're getting</font>

603
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,439
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where you're actually</font>

604
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:32,229
starting to see some real improvement

605
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,400
you're now at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this phase you</font>

606
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:38,470
have increased your maturation across

607
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,050
every level every business function in

608
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,210
the organization by to at least one some

609
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,220
people start a zero some people start a

610
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit higher</font>

611
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,690
organization but by the end of phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

612
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,320
and starting phase two you are on your

613
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:54,650
way you are picking up points so now the

614
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,178
development teams are starting to

615
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,700
understand and appreciate the security

616
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:03,480
problem awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> is starting to trickle</font>

617
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:07,320
through the organization and this is

618
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,120
important now more the team is involved

619
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,549
in practicing security not just

620
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,620
developers not just one crazy guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

621
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,139
goes we can't have cross-site scripting

622
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,610
don't you know how bad that is now

623
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,590
everybody on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development team</font>

624
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,549
understands some of the more common

625
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,439
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be</font>

626
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,480
looking at architecture is starting to

627
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:29,130
get looked at verification is in there

628
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,309
and now you possibly found<font color="#E5E5E5"> your way</font>

629
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,360
around an alligator<font color="#E5E5E5"> pond instead of</font>

630
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,100
having to jump across all those

631
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,959
alligators making have a way around it

632
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,480
maybe now you have a rope maybe now you

633
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,669
can find an underground tunnel to keep

634
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,400
things moving along rack up some more

635
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:47,179
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> which brings us to the second</font>

636
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,580
part of phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> two some of the pitfalls</font>

637
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:55,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the difficulty with moving through</font>

638
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:57,000
maturity model it is is that you know

639
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,370
you start to see things you can see

640
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,830
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so some of these</font>

641
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,789
dangerous things you did that that way

642
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,500
we weren't there at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

643
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,700
game have started up here and really now

644
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,380
that the development team is more

645
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,020
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development maturity for</font>

646
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,240
threat assessment and for a secure

647
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,500
architecture they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just they're</font>

648
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">not just going through some of these</font>

649
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,080
threat modeling activities at<font color="#CCCCCC"> john</font>

650
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">stephen or somebody else's talking about</font>

651
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're there they're really they're</font>

652
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,090
really developed they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seeing</font>

653
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,830
threats you know oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> gosh there's</font>

654
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,350
stuff we did consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my gosh our</font>

655
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,299
software isn't architected correctly oh

656
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,039
my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh and this

657
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,110
can be a problem right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean once</font>

658
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,330
people realize threats are real um they

659
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,918
can get they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuck okay they can</font>

660
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,049
their character can die right they can

661
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that it is possible</font>

662
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">to jump and not make it correctly right</font>

663
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,679
and hit that alligator and get bitten

664
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:48,200
and that could be that can be a tough

665
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,520
part that's where that champion that

666
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
charisma is going to come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> play you</font>

667
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,760
got to keep people<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving along you got</font>

668
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,899
to keep people encouraged that this is

669
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,879
not something you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting stuck in</font>

670
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,199
okay that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

671
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,400
there's that there's value here that

672
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,860
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something you'll get</font>

673
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,540
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it we also got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

674
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,189
once we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more these are</font>

675
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,960
green right this is this is all the

676
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,820
verification stuff once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

677
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
get a lot more people involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

678
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,689
testing activities whether their actual

679
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,090
testers or coders involved in peer

680
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,040
review and and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security team</font>

681
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,760
involved in design reviews and other

682
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,040
kinds of things um it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get tough it's</font>

683
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,810
like giving your game controller to this

684
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,159
guy and that guy and this guy and that

685
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,929
guy and you gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust that they're</font>

686
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to play the game okay you know</font>

687
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,290
they're playing your own game<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

688
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,700
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to rack up points for</font>

689
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,190
you and so what that means is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

690
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,620
you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful that that</font>

691
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,880
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given folks the tools to to move</font>

692
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,939
forward correctly and to play the game

693
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,700
correctly they made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font>

694
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,930
play like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're not</font>

695
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,330
necessarily on your security team

696
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,440
developers aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> programming project</font>

697
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,830
managers aren't necessarily on your

698
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,480
security team so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's move swims</font>

699
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,480
through some of these yet what's up Dave

700
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,910
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

701
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,910
certainly

702
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,799
the same thing

703
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,799
you

704
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,750
that one's death

705
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,980
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different generations</font>

706
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:35,418
german

707
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,419
that when I did

708
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,559
but

709
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not exactly sure where you ask you</font>

710
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,450
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did there is a point here that</font>

711
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,280
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer there's a reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

712
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,200
we kind of moved through governance at

713
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,180
the very beginning and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

714
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,180
establish a baseline that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all</font>

715
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,590
going to work towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i might</font>

716
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,450
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said the very beginning my</font>

717
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,830
organization does have kind of silos

718
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,780
throughout throughout it i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not exactly</font>

719
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,300
sure if if thats exactly we referring to

720
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:06,030
but but that see if it helps if you do

721
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,820
have 14 organizations split this up and

722
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this exercise go through the small</font>

723
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,409
cookie maybe not completely actively but

724
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,960
the dices up rather than kind of take

725
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,150
higher organization so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

726
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,770
suggest and now DEA is not fit city

727
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">meets maybe not 14 and I have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

728
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,190
folks in the room who may know better

729
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,080
than me but it's not 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's less</font>

730
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 10 right kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> development teams</font>

731
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,649
it's probably a handful or maybe a few

732
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,770
more than a handful you know something

733
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,990
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that um I'm gonna suggest the</font>

734
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,700
answer is no then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what was your</font>

735
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,020
question the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was do we do it</font>

736
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,820
piecemeal or do we do it across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

737
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">board I'm gonna suggest across the board</font>

738
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,439
okay and I think Michael Howard may

739
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,610
agree with me in that sense because it

740
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,290
seems like that's what Microsoft did

741
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,059
when they implemented sdl it was kind of

742
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,010
a wholesale thing it wasn't a this

743
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,480
windows project team over here and this

744
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,070
team in this team you know it was

745
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,720
everybody across the board and that's

746
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,250
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at eea so i can't speak</font>

747
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,200
for every single organization because

748
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,330
obviously if you do have large logical

749
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,070
chunks it may make sense to go over here

750
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big logical chunk and do it in</font>

751
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,830
this gigantic division and not across

752
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole enterprise</font>

753
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,170
wait look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sams structure is it</font>

754
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,060
doesn't say one hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

755
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,730
guess most of all with this set of

756
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,889
requirements to reach level<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it will</font>

757
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,720
say the majority of your developers

758
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">should know what the requirements are</font>

759
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever they may need at this time so</font>

760
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,440
that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

761
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,649
multiple standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really quest for</font>

762
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if he gives you a guidance of</font>

763
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:35,080
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go but it doesn't sleep how</font>

764
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:39,590
many boots this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point Kevin</font>

765
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,080
for the sake of completeness open Sam

766
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,540
does have references of kind of success

767
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,809
criteria for these maturity levels right

768
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,428
so that it can be standard that Kevin

769
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">can come in and assess my organization I</font>

770
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,059
could go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into Seth Stevens organization</font>

771
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,549
or what have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and say all right</font>

772
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,049
no you may say you're an open same level

773
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,090
to hear but really you're at open<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

774
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:02,059
level one because open sam says<font color="#CCCCCC"> you must</font>

775
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:04,129
have eighty percent of the team doing

776
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">such and such</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right but Abby you only</font>

777
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,330
have 75 or sentence if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

778
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,980
um so you know you may score your

779
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,559
organization however but the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

780
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,059
there is a standard it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> established</font>

781
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,440
and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not you want to pay</font>

782
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:18,620
attention the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skirts of sex criteria are</font>

783
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,360
certainly up to you however those do

784
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,309
exist and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin made a good point it's</font>

785
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,959
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hundred percent especially at</font>

786
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:27,168
these lower levels the success criteria

787
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:31,220
as defined by open Sam version 1 point 0

788
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:33,470
r are almost completely not<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100-percent</font>

789
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,419
there around 80 or 50 or something like

790
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,460
that those kinds of numbers at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower</font>

791
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:40,100
levels and they get higher as you go

792
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,870
okay so maturity doesn't mean perfection

793
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,870
maturity just means a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little older</font>

794
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,950
ready I

795
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,200
large

796
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems appealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

797
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:15,320
suffer because you know

798
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,320
we go to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and help them</font>

799
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:22,730
you there

800
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,730
later yeah

801
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,560
so this does get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back together that</font>

802
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,210
first pitfall we mentioned this log idea

803
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,950
of you you end of the screen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

804
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">logs in static typically the log in the</font>

805
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">game pit balls rolling at you if you</font>

806
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">just stand there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna hit you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

807
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,870
so a the tough part about this

808
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,820
balkanized silo kind of thing if it's if

809
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,290
it's five or fourteen or fifteen hundred

810
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,919
development groups that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be crazy</font>

811
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:48,790
but whatever um<font color="#CCCCCC"> buried in fair enough</font>

812
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nothing but but the the idea is</font>

813
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,210
open Sam doesn't say face once you take

814
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,490
five weeks phase one<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take five</font>

815
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">years you know I don't know it's up to</font>

816
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,540
your organization however<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it does it</font>

817
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,550
phase one is taking five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

818
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,200
going to get hit by that log right I

819
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:05,690
mean thank you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to develop</font>

820
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,280
before you begin realize that that if

821
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start this sucker you</font>

822
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,270
got to set up a situation within which

823
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,040
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeed or else i would suggest</font>

824
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,990
don't start do something else you know

825
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,790
wait wait to implement a maturity model

826
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,770
before you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know in</font>

827
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:20,270
phase one you can't succeed<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

828
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,590
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get run over you will indeed get</font>

829
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,330
run over if you cannot succeed in this

830
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever for your your enterprise</font>

831
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:29,030
is a short it's not short but is a

832
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:31,970
reasonable period of time great and that

833
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,320
makes it that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

834
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:37,000
you go that makes perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that</font>

835
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes perfect sense this man</font>

836
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:50,550
no there weren't any yeah you were

837
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:52,320
takedown yeah what we found was through

838
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:54,810
the use of the survey that comes with

839
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,050
open Sam we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were we were able to sleep</font>

840
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:00,780
patterns of the responses at different

841
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:04,590
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so one software development</font>

842
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:06,450
team may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been really really strong</font>

843
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,939
on code reviews for example which is

844
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,880
largely team based at the most

845
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,540
organizations whereas another team just

846
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,580
purely based on the anecdotal responses

847
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,170
that we got from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> survey may really</font>

848
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,810
have shown that they need help on

849
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,730
security requirements they don't have a

850
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:27,590
good handle on one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

851
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:30,120
so using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> questionnaire in</font>

852
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:33,780
combination with each of the activities

853
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,780
during the maturation process you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

854
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:39,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">customize your approach to that level so</font>

855
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,600
one development team may have absolutely

856
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:44,550
no need at all to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on governance</font>

857
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,189
stuff because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really good</font>

858
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,570
internal organization and so they say

859
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay yes we're doing this yes we're</font>

860
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,350
doing this here we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove it they're</font>

861
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,570
done the other teams may need to spend a

862
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,280
lot of time on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

863
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,120
and so using the questionnaire in

864
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,280
conjunction with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

865
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,830
can very easily see where those gaps

866
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,629
show up in the questionnaire and then

867
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,250
use that to customize each of the phases

868
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,980
for those teams and this is especially

869
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,810
effective for organizations with a lot

870
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">of software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> development activities going</font>

871
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:18,110
on in different silos because you don't

872
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same exact things going</font>

873
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:23,450
on you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have consistent</font>

874
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,219
activities across the board with each of

875
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:26,899
its teams to hit that success criteria

876
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:30,080
so yeah gaps are identified by the

877
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,860
software by the questionnaire and then

878
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">address by customizing each phase let me</font>

879
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,500
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question in a different way</font>

880
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,050
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to the very first</font>

881
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,060
treasure that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the map ok so</font>

882
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,440
the questionnaire that this guy

883
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,549
mentioned is a generic open same

884
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,250
questionnaire you can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

885
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:49,340
a morgue etc etc this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it looks</font>

886
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,210
like before you start you give the

887
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,130
questionnaire to a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

888
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are relevant and should know</font>

889
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,870
all the answers of questions and and

890
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,620
they go through and for any given set of

891
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,490
questions there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

892
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a lot of I don't know</font>

893
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,479
that's what it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> at level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

894
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I could speak from experience</font>

895
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,990
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of I don't know not really</font>

896
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure doesn't doesn't this other group</font>

897
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,930
have control over that or wait a minute

898
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,280
isn't that somebody else's

899
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,970
responsibility lot of that kind of

900
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,700
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you do it right and you</font>

901
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:22,850
move through phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> one largely the</font>

902
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:26,390
answers on the questionnaires then would

903
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,940
be yes no yes no yes no yes no not I

904
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,040
don't know right obviously it's not a

905
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,540
situation where until you're a super

906
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,370
maturity or whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like I</font>

907
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,270
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not there yet</font>

908
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,859
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at super maturity there's</font>

909
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,020
not a lot of yeses but at least people

910
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,850
know that yes we do that no we don't do

911
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,009
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes we do that no we don't do that</font>

912
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was the first kind of obvious</font>

913
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,830
thing that came back when you scouted we

914
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,410
got started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this sucker oh my gosh</font>

915
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:51,049
we have so far to go nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> even knows</font>

916
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">he answers these questions yeah</font>

917
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:59,380
hi of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyclist a lot people don't realize</font>

918
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,379
is that be going

919
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:09,390
I have every station

920
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,029
huge effort in the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

921
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,849
you know I

922
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,769
I mean every

923
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,769
this is

924
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,420
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely awesome great that's</font>

925
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,750
great feedback so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll keep moving</font>

926
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,860
along so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase three again you know</font>

927
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,130
we're starting to move to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of level</font>

928
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,330
twos<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places which is cool</font>

929
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,940
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some gold bars you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

930
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:48,920
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more visibility and confidence in</font>

931
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the upper levels of organization right</font>

932
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,600
so now at kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two area of</font>

933
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,250
governance those are those governance

934
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,720
areas are starting to level two we're

935
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,400
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting some consistent policy</font>

936
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,560
and consistent documentation and

937
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,570
education across the board we're now

938
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,670
seeing the beginnings of real metrics

939
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning is a real reporting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

940
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,120
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> push some information up to</font>

941
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,620
management it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be thorough or</font>

942
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,509
complete or incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like</font>

943
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,609
that but it's something and now that

944
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,830
visibility can really be a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> win for</font>

945
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,500
you as a leader of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

946
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,299
activity of the maturity model

947
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,570
implementation or the champion of it

948
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,370
you're seeing some real returns you know

949
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,870
I made me not necessarily value or

950
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,580
something yet for some real returns you

951
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:31,420
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happening and that's</font>

952
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know uh whether we like it or not</font>

953
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,490
executives care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something they can</font>

954
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,310
see they care about the you know the

955
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:40,189
graph or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar or something like</font>

956
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,509
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean whether we like it</font>

957
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,610
or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case now there's</font>

958
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,200
also there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we also get some</font>

959
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Direction here too so we don't just have</font>

960
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,089
a map we have some real a clarity that

961
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,740
you know these give it these levels that

962
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,110
that from requirements and maintenance

963
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,640
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is a formal process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

964
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,200
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what again we're not we're not</font>

965
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,700
just we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just have a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in</font>

966
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,370
place we have some relatively mature

967
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,080
things in place in in in security

968
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:04,460
requirements and and and there is

969
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to add here that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

970
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,430
really realize necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

971
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,680
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> management is a bigger</font>

972
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,509
area in open Sam it includes incident

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,730
response okay and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other kinds of</font>

982
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,990
least we know we're trying to get there

983
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we may not have a strong</font>

application incident response program or

985
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,890
activity but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get there</font>

986
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vit v m2 and vm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

987
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,950
do have that you know at least that's

988
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,570
what that's what that's what we're

989
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">working towards so I mean there really</font>

990
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:49,520
is some strong direction in the phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

991
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:53,120
area so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the bar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is being raised</font>

992
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,610
across all business functions with

993
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,319
tighter integration between some of the

00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations and development teams</font>

995
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the QA teams maybe management QA</font>

996
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,060
have now got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit tighter</font>

997
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,230
integration on their processes they

998
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,410
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other group is doing</font>

999
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,510
more often which<font color="#E5E5E5"> raises the bar which</font>

1000
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:14,270
also means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that better informed</font>

1001
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,420
management now has higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> expectations</font>

1002
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:19,820
they understand at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point what</font>

1003
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,520
should be happening for the organization

00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,770
in regards to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Software Assurance</font>

1005
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,740
maturity level and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> things go bad or</font>

1006
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,520
if there is a response that

1007
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,279
theoretically should have been handled

1008
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,040
now management has that awareness you

1009
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,200
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> given them the tools you've given</font>

1010
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,490
them the branch to smack you do you have

1011
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,549
said I'm going to lead you to the

1012
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,830
alligators oh my

1013
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:43,200
a bit so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things that</font>

1014
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know it could become a problem now</font>

1015
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,870
that they know what's what to look for

1016
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,070
you have an obligation to keep that bar

1017
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:53,220
at that level that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you raise the tube</font>

1018
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:55,170
now at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're also possibly</font>

1019
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,149
looking at wal different obstacles will

1020
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:59,490
block your path so instead of possibly

1021
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the low-hanging fruit yes we do</font>

1022
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,839
code reviews guess we do design reviews

1023
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,390
now you have more things a higher level

1024
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,390
with security requirements vulnerability

1025
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,390
management you have more things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1026
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:15,000
harder to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on because no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1027
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,160
about it the job gets harder so higher

1028
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,380
the maturation process goes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

1029
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,580
get easier but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bigger rewards</font>

1030
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,010
across the entire organization so now

1031
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:27,420
developers and operators and we just use

1032
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,840
operations and development because

1033
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,000
they're historically very separate they

1034
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,240
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy working together as lovely</font>

1035
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,360
as they do now you now have developers

1036
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,609
who have a clear understanding thanks to

1037
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,320
operational enablement and vulnerability

1038
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,450
management they have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

1039
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding of what should happen in a</font>

1040
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:50,160
cleanly running operations environment

1041
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:53,100
and likewise the Ops teams are now

1042
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,680
getting documentation and information

1043
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:58,020
that goes along with each release into

1044
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,819
their environment saying yes I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

1045
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,640
my villages I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break your</font>

1046
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:05,130
sandbox does the does anybody know

1047
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,500
operations teams that get personally

1048
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:11,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to their hardware no not so much well</font>

1049
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,309
sometimes they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they treat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1050
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,680
like their own sandbox<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so now they</font>

1051
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,480
have there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two way trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going it's</font>

1052
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,308
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a network term between the</font>

1053
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,799
development teams and operations teams

1054
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:24,900
saying I will do what I can to not break

1055
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:27,450
your environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the operations came</font>

1056
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,160
in I know what kind of service I have to

1057
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,950
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a secure environment</font>

1058
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,240
through your software so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

1059
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,680
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you have to watch out</font>

1060
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,558
for the further along in the maturation

1061
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,629
process you go but now face for we are

1062
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:45,150
going strong if you have gotten to this

1063
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:47,369
part you're now building bridges you're

1064
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,410
not just swinging on ropes anymore you

1065
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:53,880
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just walk across the bridge</font>

1066
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:56,549
you have the capability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools in</font>

1067
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,599
place to look ahead and see where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1068
00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:01,710
need to put in more work or the

1069
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,529
vulnerabilities the pitfalls are more

1070
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:07,019
apparent to you the more the higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1071
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">go in the low and look ding we just</font>

1072
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:12,808
leveled up at the end of phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 we are</font>

1073
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,099
at twos and threes in some parts of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization across the software</font>

1075
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:19,170
development lifecycle everybody is

00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:21,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">benefiting at this point so the whole</font>

1077
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,329
program is working together to build

1078
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:26,700
securely and most importantly to verify

1079
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:30,029
aggressively now because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

1080
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,169
that's been done on construction you

1081
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:34,329
have verification going on ever

1082
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,970
level of the software deployment process

1083

governance they're being built in to the

1086
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,240
code in the construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> part and then</font>

1087
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:50,020
verification has now built up a test

1088

suite of abuse cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> for test cases for</font>

1089
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,009
security requirements and you're also

they have some real understanding of

00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:06,160
where they're vulnerable and they have

1095
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone to lengths to fix it so which takes</font>

1096
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,819
us into some of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:16,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">run into is a problem right so so you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> kavitha is when these last few</font>

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,670
pitfalls you could run into my<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole I</font>

1100
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,380
kind of just mean someplace you can get

1101
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,660
stuck but you know Ron Ross was talking

1102
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,910
about compliance not being security and

1103
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,410
sources it's it's it's a it's a source

1104
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,569
of dismay in the security community

1105
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,609
across the board that<font color="#E5E5E5"> compliance is not</font>

1106
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:38,049
security you are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where</font>

1107
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,020
you know at policy compliant policy

1108
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:42,759
compliance level 3 where the

1109
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:46,509
organization does see compliance is more

1110
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,480
of a an issue or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a factor across the</font>

1111
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,190
board and so um you know it can get to a

1112
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,119
point where<font color="#E5E5E5"> management is saying hey</font>

1113
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,460
we're not complying with their own

1114
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:57,520
policies and we're in and and and and

1115
00:43:54,460 --> 00:44:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can get stuck so you know to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1116
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,470
perfectly honest te a is definitely not

1117
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,900
here yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1118
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:09,970
potential problem that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1119
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:11,500
as we go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen we're also not here</font>

1120
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,058
either you know we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> reached we</font>

1121
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,829
haven't reached maturity shangri-la I

1122
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:16,720
don't know if anybody has maybe some of

1123
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:19,089
you guys have in this room since<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1124
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,950
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some maturity models but but</font>

1125
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:23,410
there really is there is a place I think

1126
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're headed that's a more mature</font>

1127
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,180
place a you know a really an area of

1128
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:29,500
software assurance and and I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1129
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,430
how it feels but but we haven't gotten

1130
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,690
there yet so I just wanted to say

1131
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:34,640
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying about the timeline</font>

1132
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,349
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what you guys are talking</font>

1133
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,790
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> artists mountaineering and I</font>

1134
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:39,410
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> have experience in the</font>

1135
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,670
realtor said you guys are presenting

1136
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,649
this in short

1137
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:44,839
and you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three but the</font>

1138
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,420
galley is fisting take some serious time

1139
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,100
and don't expect you know tha overnight

1140
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,270
and stick with it

1141
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,740
playing the word with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as</font>

1142
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">playing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your work and work your plan</font>

1143
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:56,069
stick with what

1144
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,779
yeah I really think that is the key

1145
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,280
message I started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad kind of within</font>

1146
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,080
the treasures area and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end</font>

1147
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,119
with that then and I'm glad you helped

1148
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,500
me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really they're having that plan</font>

1149
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,480
and having that roadmap having that

1150
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,890
direction where you're headed that's the

1151
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,330
powerful thing here with this maturity

1152
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,589
model I don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys I'm</font>

1153
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,509
the kind of person that doesn't like to

1154
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:15,300
begin with a blank page if I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

1155
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,820
blank page III got I got blocked I can't

1156
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,040
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything ok open Sam helps me helps</font>

1157
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,050
the person like me because i have i have

1158
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,330
a layout I have something I can work oh

1159
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,400
good i got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a task i can do tasks you</font>

1160
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,290
know task for<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat in person I can step</font>

1161
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,849
back a new strategy to but open Sam to

1162
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:32,070
some extent has done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of that for</font>

1163
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">me okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can review the strategy I can</font>

1164
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:36,570
tweak the strategy right I can modify it

1165
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:38,270
um but I've got some of the beginnings

1166
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,950
of that strategy I know where I'm headed

1167
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:43,609
and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just work it really created a</font>

1168
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,609
program for<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1169
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,480
that you decided

1170
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,579
or didn't think any or<font color="#CCCCCC"> some legs I know</font>

1171
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,059
when we look grip like what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font>

1172
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about using industry cost</font>

1173
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:59,300
analysis to determine whether around

1174
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:02,560
control or not and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all people</font>

1175
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,050
ever run routes that level of maturity

1176
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,509
got it you got it we did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

1177
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:11,480
I'm approaching it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to lay out the</font>

1178
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:13,190
the each of the maturity levels as 24

1179
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,810
hour direction and to really just begin

1180
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,670
at the beginning to begin in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

1181
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:18,170
few faces and work through that and if

1182
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,030
we come to a point where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1183
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:21,620
impractical to move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't</font>

1184
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,720
have an alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's reasonable</font>

1185
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,210
because I might argue there may be a way

1186
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to modify that that requirement to be</font>

1187
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonable for your organization your</font>

1188
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,820
state agency so yeah something like that

1189
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,580
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily make make perfect</font>

1190
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,590
sense but but you know if you can't find

1191
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,330
an alternative it may make sense to

1192
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:41,240
strike it but we also get another way

1193
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,370
you know because at<font color="#E5E5E5"> rackspace you to</font>

1194
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,549
work not a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece you know it's</font>

1195
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:48,170
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> as formalized and rigid stuff some</font>

1196
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,810
of the levels of maturity would just be

1197
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:53,480
impractical for<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible to get back</font>

1198
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,940
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm and so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1199
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,410
like about doping<font color="#E5E5E5"> sam is is so variable</font>

1200
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,780
and all the different sections that you

1201
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">can kind of say or do put more emphasis</font>

1202
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,700
on requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and less</font>

1203
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:07,109
in our gardening or Blair I think that's

1204
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,339
an excellent point and I didn't we

1205
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:09,930
didn't really point it out and we showed

1206
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,660
that roadmap template that we were using

1207
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,980
but we didn't get to level that road

1208
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,960
that template doesn't have us at level 3

1209
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,390
in every in every area it definitely

1210
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,009
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I that's a very good</font>

1211
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,359
point Kevin that it may not be

1212
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:23,999
reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your organization to even</font>

1213
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,009
get past level 2 in most areas level 3

1214
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:27,149
may not make much sense for whatever

1215
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,069
reason because again you know when

1216
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,390
you're not modifying open same standard

1217
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:31,920
we're not tweaking and saying oh no its

1218
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,170
you know the success criteria are

1219
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,430
different or this or that you know it's

1220
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,710
like if you modify open Sam it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1221
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:39,269
open Sam anymore and that's okay but but

1222
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,710
so use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works for you and</font>

1223
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:42,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1224
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,140
beyond a maturity level then don't make

1225
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own roadmap</font>

1226
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one of the nice things about the</font>

1227
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,390
open Sam framework is that at each

1228
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,970
maturity level for each discipline it

1229
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,770
has a set of activities that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

1230
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,750
be engaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it doesn't tell you how</font>

1231
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,840
you have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> those but those are also</font>

1232
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:22,940
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good ideas of what you can do how</font>

1233
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,130
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> your abstraction where can I</font>

1234
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,660
take this and where can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I apply it even</font>

1235
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,400
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go full on to level</font>

1236
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">three there are some of the things in</font>

1237
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that I can apply and still</font>

1238
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:38,930
get benefit without fully going down

1239
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:41,709
that to the maturation process AJ did

1240
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,710
you have a Christian

1241
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,180
here

1242
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,299
ensure page 315 my two directions

1243
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:56,830
and again is you know the decision

1244
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,420
across the organization needs to be

1245
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,100
clear no we're not addressing this right

1246
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,370
now that's or is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not</font>

1247
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,740
applicable that's a fine answer cool

1248
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:07,540
well folks it is chin before the hour

1249
