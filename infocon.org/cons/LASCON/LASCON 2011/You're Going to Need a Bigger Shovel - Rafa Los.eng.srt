me yeah go on a bar mo mike he

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:30,850
apologized we've hacked the microphone

13
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:32,589
system good afternoon my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Dennis</font>

14
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,240
Hurst I'm with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HP enterprise</font>

15
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,880
security group I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,970
introducing raft<font color="#CCCCCC"> lows today so I've</font>

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,070
actually known raft since 2002 I think

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,509
2002 when uh we we're way way back when

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were first developing web inspect</font>

20
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:48,400
wrath was one of our first customers out

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,380
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> GE and we've been friends and</font>

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,910
co-workers for the by the past decade

23
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,589
now so it's my pleasure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce</font>

24
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,660
Raph he's gonna be talking about some

25
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,250
application security issues so I just

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say thank you very</font>

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:04,810
much for attending and Raph thanks guys

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:10,538
hello give me the big room

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:15,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so then I take this up</font>

30
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:17,769
god it's heavy so the talk my talk this

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:28,029
afternoon is Carly gonna need a bigger

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:29,800
trouble anybody want to guess why Shh so

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically a critical look at</font>

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,459
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> security assurance as a</font>

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,209
practice as a model as something you've

36
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,640
implemented or tried and failed and as

37
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,769
something that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying to</font>

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,809
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do correctly say</font>

39
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside right before I got to know Dennis</font>

40
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,780
so about 12 13 years for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

41
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,079
this is how to catch more information

42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,760
from me I run a podcast I on a blog i

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,500
ramble on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter stream every once in</font>

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,599
a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> i encourage you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the podcast</font>

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,980
to listen because it's actually some

46
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,230
really interesting people I don't talk

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,569
much so I'll save you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we have a</font>

48
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,518
lot of great people etc on that show<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

49
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,899
30 minutes at a time every two weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,980
we talk about issues that you probably

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,750
care about so I just by a show of hands

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,420
anybody want to admit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,880
blue it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

54
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,190
admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three types of</font>

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,630
organizations there's those that get

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,250
software security assurance that

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,519
actually understand the principles and

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,800
and trouble and all the implementations

59
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,360
behind it those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are fooling</font>

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,650
themselves into thinking they get it and

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,870
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of everybody else who's</font>

62
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,510
just spending lots and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and</font>

63
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting very low return on that okay and</font>

64
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,929
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what software</font>

65
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,420
security assurances versus what

66
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,870
application security is you guys we've

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,309
started using the terms interchangeably

68
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,230
application security isn't software

69
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,880
security assurance actually they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

70
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,899
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing application security when</font>

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,799
we talk about what's the first thing

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">that pops to mind anybody lively crowd</font>

73
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,100
try again anybody right scanning

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,839
cross-site scripting all those types of

75
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,180
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very technical something</font>

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,739
I can take a apolis i can buy something

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,850
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it go away generally right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

78
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,798
try software security assurance is a

79
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,600
little bit different right<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we look</font>

80
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,280
at software<font color="#E5E5E5"> security assurance what</font>

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,539
we're thinking and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is all</font>

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,700
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make up something</font>

83
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,260
strategic longer term that has a much

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,570
greater impact than a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in</font>

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,969
time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the impact of a program</font>

86
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,830
versus an audit so application

87
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">securities it tends to talk about</font>

88
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,859
securing software using tools and

89
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology things that do a specific</font>

90
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,300
purpose that serve a specific purpose

91
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and application security the highest you</font>

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,460
can probably ever measure that is at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CISO level we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how well we</font>

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,570
can measure something<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay software</font>

96
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,080
a program approach driven by risks I

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,120
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it as a way of</font>

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and if anybody saw</font>

99
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,979
John's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> siemens presentation earlier</font>

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,840
it's about modeling what you're up

101
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,150
against and then figuring out rational

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,039
solutions to that that sometimes

103
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved buying things sometimes involve</font>

104
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,190
changing culture sometimes involve

105
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,159
everything you can possibly think of an

106
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,469
enzyme and it's actually measured much

107
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,020
differently its measured at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chief</font>

108
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,490
information officer or chief technology

109
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,139
officer or if you get really lucky you

110
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">can measure it at like the chief by SCF</font>

111
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:38,349
Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> chief risk officer level but its</font>

112
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:41,740
measured much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly than just the</font>

113
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,779
technology stack and people process

114
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,939
always come first in the software

115
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:47,229
security assurance model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

116
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:50,319
contrary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what you've heard from many</font>

117
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:52,628
vendors it buying something and pointing

118
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,759
a scanner at something or having an

119
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,560
application scan and assess doesn't

120
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,889
actually make you any more secure in the

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,550
long run had a great conversation with

122
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:08,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">an information security officer at a</font>

123
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:10,689
rather large auto company that likened

124
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:14,050
application security modern application

125
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,939
security to crash testing cars he says

126
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,430
what we try to do or why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see my</font>

127
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,129
security teams trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do bless you is</font>

128
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,039
a repeatedly crash cars and they wonder

129
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:29,319
why they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> any safer that makes</font>

130
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense to anybody so there's a couple of</font>

131
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,029
steps to every good software security

132
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:36,310
assurance program and if you're not

133
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:38,469
taking them in this kind of stride in

134
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,560
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in this methodology in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

135
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:43,060
way odds are you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to and</font>

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,009
you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach a state</font>

137
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,659
where you're actually happy and you're

138
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to continue on what we've long</font>

139
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,300
termed as the hamster wheel of pain here

140
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:54,069
in security where you spend more and you

141
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,810
throw more at it and you do more but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

142
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:57,430
still get hat so you spend more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

143
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,469
spend more time and you hire more people

144
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:02,649
and you still get hacked and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this</font>

145
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:05,589
town would spiral it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and so</font>

146
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:07,899
step one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously assessment knowing</font>

147
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:11,889
where you are some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situational</font>

148
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:15,520
awareness of what you've walked into

149
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,580
what you've stepped out on to and I call

150
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,878
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rational assessment because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

151
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really put take off these sort of</font>

152
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,620
rosy color glasses i think in

153
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,818
information security we've continued to

154
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">i still meet people every day that sort</font>

155
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">of make fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their developers how</font>

156
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,139
stupid their users are and how they just

157
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:39,909
don't get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you want to go ok</font>

158
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,300
well can you go right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code better</font>

159
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:45,440
nigga well no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can break it that's</font>

160
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,060
great I can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> smell</font>

161
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,160
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> window</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

162
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,350
right I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> high up on this breaker</font>

163
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,520
builder model i'd like to have more

164
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,960
builder interaction more glorifying of

165
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,580
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually solve problems</font>

166
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,890
versus the ones that create more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

167
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,180
and it's all important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get it it's</font>

168
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,830
important to highlight where the bugs

169
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,870
are where the problems are highlight

170
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,060
where the dead bodies are but really if

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,810
you're not helping anybody solve it are

172
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,450
you any less of the problem so it's a

173
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,140
rational assessment of capabilities

174
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:25,010
resources assets liabilities

175
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:26,840
organizational structure and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

176
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,060
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on that list is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

organizational goal how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

178
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,669
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room that work for a company</font>

179
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,740
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vendor can articulate the top</font>

organization

183
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:51,479
if you cannot what are you trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

184
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:53,189
accomplish and if you say security<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

185
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,040
could have a really fun conversation

186
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:58,319
about what does that mean if you don't

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,439
have a goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to which to which you are</font>

188
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:03,299
aspiring what are you aspiring to your

189
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,689
aspiring to a mythical state of security

190
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,369
that does not exist and this is why we

191
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:10,829
get into that downward spiral spending

192
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:12,529
more and still getting hacked right the

193
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,758
budgets<font color="#CCCCCC"> in information security in</font>

194
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,769
application security continue to

195
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,779
increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> year over year actually that's</font>

196
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fastest growing part of information</font>

197
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,279
security is the budgets for software

198
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,110
security are we getting any better at

199
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,829
application security that answer is

200
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,589
really easy no we're not we're still

201
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:36,660
getting hacked so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

202
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,459
and a colleague of mine Eric was a chief

203
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,618
risk officer now at a very large company

204
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,910
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> always starts off conversations</font>

205
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:44,779
with people he doesn't know in

206
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:48,988
situations like this and he asks the

207
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:53,850
people that work for him if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

208
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:56,549
helping my company succeed then you're

209
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,559
hindering progress so how are you what

210
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:59,879
are you doing to help that further that

211
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,049
along so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you a concrete</font>

212
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,629
example here because it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

213
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:08,029
esoteric terms here say you work for a

214
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,029
hospital where hospitals care about

215
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,069
survivability that makes sense how many

216
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:17,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">people they don't they basically convert</font>

217
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:19,889
from there you know being on the

218
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,499
precipice of death to walking out of the

219
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,989
hospital happily right there's a there's

220
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:27,619
a specific and its really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more</font>

221
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:30,600
debate there's a specific number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

222
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:34,079
metrics behind how many people walk into

223
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,970
or wheeled into a hospital trauma unit

224
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,069
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are expected to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

225
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,079
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them aren't goals in an</font>

226
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:42,269
organization like that from that

227
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">viewpoint has nothing to do with</font>

are you doing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we look at</font>

have to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

235
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:03,330
we're securing your company and we

236
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,240
wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody gets us right but the</font>

237
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,860
light bulb has to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on at some point</font>

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,960
you have to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dots if you're</font>

239
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an assessment you have to be</font>

240
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,530
careful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i call it everybody</font>

241
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,240
talks about paralysis by analysis you

242
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">can keep doing an analysis and you keep</font>

243
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,870
being more thorough and more thorough

244
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,590
and more thorough but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your analysis</font>

245
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:25,380
takes two years what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you started</font>

246
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,870
analyzing has probably changed it is no

247
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:32,310
longer valid and your end state your

248
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:35,820
result is no longer valid also the idea

249
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:39,420
that you want to be thorough enough to

250
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,130
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the problem but you</font>

251
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,660
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move fast enough to have</font>

252
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,010
something actionable that comes out of

253
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:50,280
that and so step two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is resource</font>

254
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,960
planning if you're going to set up a

255
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,459
software security program you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,670
have resources this is sort of a

257
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">no-brainer however it's not the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

258
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,319
no-brainer that you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so resources</font>

259
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,390
what can you do with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already</font>

260
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,310
have there's different types of

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,960
resources in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your organization there's</font>

262
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology there's the people aspect</font>

263
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,970
there is also this thing called time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

264
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">capital</font>

265
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,189
if you've ever heard somebody talk about

266
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,380
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember when Penn tests were</font>

267
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,740
like nothing to do or be a pen tester

268
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,089
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> d think to do because everybody why</font>

269
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,980
were people doing pen test so much

270
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:30,920
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were going to get the</font>

274
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,390
completely false premise anybody want to

275
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,390
guess

276
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:46,949
big right your time boxed your time

277
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:49,618
constraint how many hackers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:55,679
break into that Bank are going to say

00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,738
going to scare myself 20 30 38 hours for

00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:04,019
the attack two hours for the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,519
hit any critical assets because we don't

287
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,519
want to kill business

288
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,860
most pen test I mean yes the really good

289
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,560
ones actually take those rules out but

290
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,230
how many executives are happy about that

291
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,260
what if you break something then you

292
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">break something but so planning for</font>

293
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,350
resource allocation it's kind of

294
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,710
interesting I've worked with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

295
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,670
large companies that start talking and

296
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about software security</font>

297
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:39,719
assurance programs in a long term and

298
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,069
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> long term is five years like man I</font>

299
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,450
don't know what the what anything is

300
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,160
going to look like in five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

301
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,160
we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to prognosticate that far</font>

302
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,040
out we've all been<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong every single</font>

303
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,930
one of us man three years out is a

304
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,510
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough to guess why don't we look</font>

305
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,859
at this more importantly if you're going

306
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,910
to set up a security program<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

307
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,910
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement over the course of</font>

308
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,880
five years give any idea what the

309
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,709
technology landscape in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> global</font>

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,090
political landscape the technology

311
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,030
landscape is going to look like in five

312
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,860
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't we might have brain</font>

313
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,860
implants by that and our computers might

314
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,600
be in our heads I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font>

315
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,400
threat landscape completely changes by

316
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you get to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point right so</font>

317
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,340
we've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some rational</font>

318
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:26,920
timelines 6 12 18 36 months tops to get

319
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,960
out to 36 months the further out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

320
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,110
the more theoretical you have to be that

321
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense you can't say in 36 months</font>

322
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,250
I'm going to be analyzing these this

323
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,750
struts code with this tool and these

324
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,460
three people because those three people

325
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,430
probably won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for you if this is</font>

326
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,230
security we know people change that tool

327
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,500
will probably go have gone through 27

328
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,530
iterations or be gone in some cases and

329
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,530
your

330
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,949
not coding in that same framework

331
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,820
anymore and if you are then you're now

332
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,820
considered legacy

333
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,710
this is all these important things i

334
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,460
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when information security groups</font>

335
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:08,040
try to tackle software security and they

336
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,030
fight hard and they get put center stage

337
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,089
of their company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then those two</font>

338
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:18,300
resources gals guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever end up</font>

339
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,280
going yes as of tomorrow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cio set</font>

340
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,979
every app that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> released has to go</font>

341
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,110
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and then tomorrow comes they</font>

342
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,200
got 74 emails in their inboxes as all

343
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,710
these have to be analyzed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday you</font>

344
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,710
wanted it

345
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,740
now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fail by success you can</font>

346
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,620
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the damn too wide and then</font>

347
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,930
what happens then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

348
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,190
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> big boss that well okay I can</font>

349
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,719
handle one app<font color="#CCCCCC"> for five days I know</font>

350
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,550
there's 74 in the queue but I can't

351
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,990
handle them on they go okay well so some

352
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,630
of them get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bypass you how does this</font>

353
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,280
work who determines that and I'll said

354
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,540
that you've got a bypass switch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

355
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,630
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets ugly right then everybody</font>

356
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,839
bypasses you will you in source

357
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,040
outsource or do a hybrid of the two if

358
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,210
you're in sourcing means you're going to

359
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to train people how long does it</font>

360
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,830
take to wrap that program up is it take

361
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,090
to a year to Train everybody to hire

362

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring them up to speed on your</font>

363
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,800
technology by the way by now it's all

364
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,010
changed try<font color="#CCCCCC"> again start over are you</font>

365
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,329
going to outsource are you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

the people that write your source code

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:26,110
also do the analysis of it this is

called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fox guarding the hen house</font>

outsourced completely are you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,610
tried all have failed that's why we're

390
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,919
still here<font color="#CCCCCC"> will budgets increase</font>

391
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,500
decrease<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can you leverage your line</font>

392
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,500
of business the best manager I've ever

393
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,620
had I look to him as a mentor for myself

394
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,300
I joined his team and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

395
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,489
thing he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said was I'm going to basically</font>

396
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,190
get rid of the information security

397
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,750
budget almost completely we were we also

398
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,640
all five of us sort of looked at him and

399
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,120
went uh

400
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,030
you're crazy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the greatest thing</font>

401
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,590
about that is he was right the line of

402
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,629
business paid for all the security

403
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,699
aspects he said you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do business</font>

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">with customer X they require pci</font>

certification you got to pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

406
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,270
they go well isn't that a security thing

407
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,870
goes nope they want to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it i</font>

408
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:08,629
don't care if your PCI certified or not

409
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:10,219
you do see the genius there anyway can

410
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,800
you write can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the right</font>

resources in the right positions to

412
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,280
succeed this is the do you report to the

413
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,440
right person question if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if your</font>

an operational role forget it because

417
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,800
it's a conflict of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get it</font>

418
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,110
out there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch it later right just</font>

419

<font color="#E5E5E5">make the business happy or do you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

420
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,560
right anybody want to guess is the only

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some table stakes how much</font>

one that which was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> win that one</font>

423
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:46,429
99.999 percent of the time sad but true

424
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,669
so step three intelligent process

425
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,080
building you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

426
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,040
processes for the sake of having

sometimes career processes make success
