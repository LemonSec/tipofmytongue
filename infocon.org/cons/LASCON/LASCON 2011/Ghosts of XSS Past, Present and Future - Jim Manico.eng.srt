a pretty good job of organizing and I

<font color="#CCCCCC">junior you talk to you about the</font>

31
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:49,090
cross-site scripting I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

32
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">press I scripting you know we all know</font>

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,229
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot it's been</font>

34
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:55,149
around for a while and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

35
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I come across with it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the field</font>

36
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:59,049
as I especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability</font>

37
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">assessments and penetration testing and</font>

38
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:04,899
things like that I see it all the time

39
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,459
and it really does cause a lot of

40
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,179
problems whether they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simple</font>

41
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:14,440
audit and compliance issues or real

42
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:17,860
seriously well opening opening up

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:23,100
avenues for attack how many he'll do

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,050
well mobility assessments or audits okay

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,960
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are developers</font>

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,240
mostly ok so you guys build a brunt of

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,710
the auditors and the vulnerability

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,550
assessment penetration testers come in

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,260
right so I seen this coming across from

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,670
two ways a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times people talk</font>

51
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,100
about the cross-site scripting and from

52
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development angle on on how we can</font>

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,359
fix this we all know we see those those

54
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,040
issues out there we'd rather interesting

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,500
parts about it is is thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,410
from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective or from the auditors</font>

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,910
perspective or the IT guy you know you

58
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,049
guys are building great programs but

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,579
it's running on somebody else's

60
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,180
infrastructure or corporate

61
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,560
infrastructure so when one folks come in

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,940
and we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these vulnerabilities we</font>

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,490
find them embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other</font>

64
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,010
applications maybe a company's bought a

65
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,570
product and it's got Apache and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got</font>

66
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,549
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things built into this</font>

67
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,340
they're all part of it we can't fix

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,830
those you know is what happens is now

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,420
the IT guys are just they're stuck

70
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,270
they're not developer so they can't fix

71
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,970
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in home routers yeah crosses</font>

72
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,490
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home routers right yeah so</font>

73
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,480
well I guess here this is hopefully

74
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,970
we're going to bring up some awareness

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,500
for everybody and and maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

76
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,270
to get people to fix the little snippets

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,650
of code that we have out there so this

78
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully will eventually go away</font>

79
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,230
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very least just think about</font>

80
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how this is all impacting it</font>

81
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,980
down the line that we can find a

82
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,950
vulnerability but we cannot there's

83
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,500
nothing we can do about it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

84
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,880
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some other other ideas and</font>

85
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,820
other ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can probably help</font>

86
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,829
mitigate this risk if not eliminated so

87
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,269
I mean why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it so serious we all see</font>

88
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,670
these vulnerabilities the session

89
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:05,790
hijacking the site defacement network

90
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:07,709
scanning cross-site request forgery the

91
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,989
fishing I mean this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all stuff that</font>

92
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,570
goes after we all see this we all know

93
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,860
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it's real and being</font>

94
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,900
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of the attacks and</font>

95
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,060
investigations I see this happen a lot

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,108
not necessarily through just cross site

97
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,420
scripting but through other

98
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:23,310
vulnerabilities as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

99
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,520
this whole increases the company's risk

100
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,770
and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end well you know so what</font>

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,900
it's all about and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my other tax I</font>

102
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,000
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this if there's there's a</font>

103
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,549
security aspect to it but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all business risk</font>

105
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,490
there's reputational risk involved

106
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,500
there's financial risk that directly

107
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,040
there's legal and regulatory issues that

108
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,720
come up and hopefully we can all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

109
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,870
know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world a better</font>

110
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,700
place that's really bad you know that's

111
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,380
all good and fine to say but I know when

112
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,920
I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place where when I've worked</font>

113
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other people I'm not necessarily</font>

114
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,930
doing it to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world a better</font>

115
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,910
place the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there and as</font>

116
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,310
long as they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not bothering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me or my</font>

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,380
clients I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I'll</font>

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,910
make the building secure figuratively

119
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,860
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them go to the next</font>

120
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">place the guy next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> door because he's the</font>

121
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy with early open doors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know he's</font>

122
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,409
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the broken windows the</font>

123
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,150
doors and windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> are left wide open</font>

124
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,840
that's where the bad guys are going to

125
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,310
go and I think when you when you think

126
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,789
about it you ever heard the story about

127
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the outrunning the bear yeah well I</font>

128
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,180
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to outrun the bear he's the</font>

129
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,670
bad guy I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outrun the next</font>

130
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,980
guy so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I'm more secure their</font>

131
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:42,120
to go somewhere else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some things</font>

132
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,800
to think about and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe now we</font>

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,190
just turn us over jinsuk some of his

134
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,600
stuff going and have at it thank you

135
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:59,510
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you I appreciate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beat let me</font>

136
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:02,160
get myself dialed in here is that good

137
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,140
please forgive me I'm very sick and

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,890
losing my voice a bit i'm just going to

139
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,890
charge anyway so

140
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,960
let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with cross-site scripting</font>

141
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,660
and the severity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it and I lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

142
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,239
consider cross-site scripting to be the

143
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,639
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two item in the OS up 10 it's a</font>

144
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,169
relatively big deal most most times

145
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,880
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are

146
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,490
rated to have a relatively high severity

147
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,159
the problem is is that cross site

148
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,930
scripting pops up so much in almost

149
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,180
every assessment I've ever done I've

150
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,830
found a significant number of cross-site

151
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,440
scripting vulnerabilities and most of us

152
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,630
who do security testing they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

153
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,240
same kind of experience and so because

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,000
it comes up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it's hard to squash</font>

155
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,370
on a regular permanent basis for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large</font>

other the other perspective is a white

160
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,500
hat we do a lot of metrics so when we

161
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,630
when we find a vulnerability in a bit

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,310
someone's website we keep scanning and

163
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,710
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> checking on a regular basis until</font>

164
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,500
it's fixed so we can apply metrics over

165
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,539
time we have some folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> who had the same</font>

166
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,930

175
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,090
information in just a few moments but I

176
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,400
say cross-site scripting is is a big

177
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:39,130
deal it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level severity issue</font>

178
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,349
because it completely undermines your

179
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,169
browser so let's go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

180
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:46,000
session hijacking so again r it is

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,139
cross-site scripting cross-site

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,240
scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well i as a as a bad guy</font>

183
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,729
can inject JavaScript arbitrary

184
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,159
malicious JavaScript into my victims

185
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:00,940
browser that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we might be cross</font>

186
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,190
posting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on a forum and I</font>

187
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,320
post comments that include JavaScript

188
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:07,780
and someone else reads that comment is

189
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,389
able to execute that<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that's</font>

190
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,919
the basic vulnerability pattern on the

191
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,229
other part of cross-site scripting is

192
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,780
reflective cross-site scripting suppose

193
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,090
the

194
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,090
payload cannot be stored in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website</font>

195
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,580
but suppose I can build a URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

196
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,770
includes the attack payload it's a real

197
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,229
URL to your domain but when someone

198
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">clicks on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether the parameter where</font>

199
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,000
the planters includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

200
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,760
executes that's called reflective XSS to

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,070
two basic categories so in this attack

202
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,250
happens what can the attacker do number

203
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,310
one session hijacking window dot

204
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,680
location to some evil server<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font>

205
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:47,900
document.cookie well that executes on

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,170
your site it grabs a copy of the current

207
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,819
users cookie and it passes it off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

209
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,330
their server logs will show your cookie

210
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,180
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> includes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your session data</font>

211
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,210
which allows the tackler to relatively

212
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,300
easily hijack your session or site to

213
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,100
Faceman who hears are just developer

214
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,780
developer developer I'm so<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to see</font>

215
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,910
so many developers in this room this is

216
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,220
this is excellent so developers what

217
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript can you do to completely</font>

218
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,480
deface any website you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell me what</font>

219
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript will totally over like the</font>

220
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:30,380
HTML of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire site document dot</font>

221
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:33,170
body dot that right or document our body

222
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,450
that inner HTML is new code and that's

223
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,760
it so the attacker needs to get like one

224
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,440
line of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript into your system and</font>

225
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,960
get a victim to click on it and they can

226
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,300
override the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can</font>

227
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">even overlay targeted parts of a page</font>

228
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,410
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> overwrite one particular element</font>

229
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:54,290
in the Dom document dot get there by ID

230
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,810
the elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier and then in an</font>

231
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,790
HTML or<font color="#E5E5E5"> set element or different API is</font>

232
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,219
based on what that component is so now

233
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,189
you can in a targeted way as an attacker

234
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,160
say what if I say just overlay the

235
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:11,120
source attribute of your login form what

236
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,829
happens yeah you log in and that login

237
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,570
information goes somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

oh well so let's let's get into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

352
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,810
so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to the 1990s the 1990s</font>

353
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,260
is when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early 90s is when cross-site</font>

354
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,630
scripting first came about what did<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

355
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,939
is a security community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font>

356
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,040
was not used as much back in the 90's in

357
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,440
fact if you're a web developer in the

358
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,230
90s using a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got it</font>

359
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,690
you got date for doing that your

360
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,550
father's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad developer to put a</font>

361
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,040
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of javascript in your page back in</font>

362
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early 90s because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript did not</font>

363
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,899
work in a cross-browser ray well it was

364
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really slow it was buggy as all heck it</font>

365
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,370
was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we used a lot in web</font>

366
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,709
development early 90s now be the dawn of

367
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,779
the web page in fact one of my

368
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,209
requirements was and many of my websites

369
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,769
fridge for GE I was a GE programmer for

370
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,149
many years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was you are not</font>

371
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,190
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any javascript is</font>

372
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,810
actually a clear requirement doesn't

373
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,699
exist anymore today you can't build a

374
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,160
real website without javascript bug me

375
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,859
today so back in the 90s we would tell

376
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,839
developers just strip out these bad

377
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,069
characters<font color="#CCCCCC"> just strip out less than</font>

378
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:11,560
greater than ampersand semicolon on dot

379
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:14,290
synthetic let me ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font>

380
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,660
strategy today is to strip out these

381
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,550
characters and that's your main strategy

382
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,920
for cross-site scripting what do you

383
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that why does the strategy not</font>

384
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you write but way simpler than that</font>

385
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,790
what if you take I agree give me more

386
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,319
though so you tell your boss I need to

387
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,040
strip out here we give you a specific

388
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,810
example so you have a last<font color="#E5E5E5"> name field</font>

389
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,689
first name<font color="#CCCCCC"> last name address one city</font>

390
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,790
state you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a last name field but if</font>

391
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're stripping out the single single</font>

392
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,399
quote in your last name field what

393
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,420
country did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just piss off you don't</font>

394
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,830
mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

you don't mess with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Irish but</font>

398
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously you break business</font>

399
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,550
requirements when you start stripping

400
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,490
our characters this strategy doesn't

401
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,500
work then it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> today it's not</font>

402
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work tomorrow but this is the</font>

403
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:18,190
advice we gave in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 90s and any data</font>

404
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a some kind of input validation</font>

405
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,450
this is absolute fail we need to do

406
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,050
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that so now you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about now</font>

407
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:27,610
we're jumping ahead to about year 2000

408
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:31,149
year 2000 when we first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started talking</font>

409
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:33,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">about HTML entity and coding this is the</font>

410
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,310
dawn of the Ajax era the beginning of

411
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,800
heavy JavaScript rich in an application

412
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:41,290
development just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of it so</font>

413
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,330
now it was it was a little bit more ok

414
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,940
to use heavy javascript in your sight

415
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,360
around year 2000 and this is when olas

416
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,910
first published its its article on HTML

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,979
entity output and coding so you would

418
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,740
say we'll just take for every character

419
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,920
just take that character and replace it

420
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,770
with this HTML entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalence so for</font>

421
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,470
less than inside a less than sign we

422
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,440
would replace that with a purse and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lt</font>

when the browser sees a less than sign

425
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,610
it's going to try to render to say that

426
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,040
to be part of the tag it will start to

427
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,229
open up the HTML rendering engine and

428
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,050
start to parse that like HTML when the

429

browser sees an ampersand LT semicolon

430
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:33,220
what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I'm sorry it displays</font>

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,530
it like you're all right it doesn't

433
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,600
execute it doesn't treat it like a

434
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,570
special<font color="#CCCCCC"> character it just renders it</font>

435
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,309
unscreened so HTML entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> encoding in</font>

436
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,740
some cases it is

437
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right answer but you tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me now</font>

438
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,929
think of how complex our web development

439
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,439
is if I go to a developer I say just do

440
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:58,269
HTML entity encoding everywhere and

441
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,399
cross-site scripting is going to be not

442
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:08,580
a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore it's all fixed what's</font>

443
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:08,580
wrong with that strategy I'm sorry

444
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,649
where

445
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,850
that's fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font>

446
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,340
that this is not here's what I'm trying

447
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:24,330
to say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is incomplete bad advice why</font>

448
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,970
can you raise your right hand for a

<font color="#E5E5E5">weird right away multiple context that's</font>

453
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,860
what that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to say you add</font>

454
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">me up multiple contexts there you go so</font>

455
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,449
that's that's the thing when when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

456
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:55,080
when you take input untrusted input from

457
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,960
the request and you display it in an

HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> page you need to encode it and</font>

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,970
you put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a in a JavaScript variable</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">completely different way and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font>

467
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,679
about that in a moment so now we are

468
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,990
year 2000 we're saying any piece of data

based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on now now we're jumping ahead to</font>

473
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,620
about today now we're looking at the

474
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,419
advice that we've given starting around

475
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:41,820
year 2000 year 2007 2007 is when the OS

476
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,280
x SS cheat sheet was first pushed out

477
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,460
its way the first documents to ever talk

478
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,649
about multiple contexts for XSS output

479
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and coding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it wasn't correct when</font>

480
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">they first pushed it out but it was a</font>

481
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,110
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

482
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,140
flaws in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our strategy in just a moment</font>

483
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,179
so now we're around year 2007<font color="#E5E5E5"> where for</font>

484
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,670
the first time talking about multiple

485
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,070
contexts and based on where David goes

486
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:07,370
we deal with it differently HTML entity

487
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,669
and coding HTML attribute encoding

488
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,530
cascading style sheet hex encoding

489
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript hex encoding</font>

490
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,200
and URL validation URL encoding an

491
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:20,270
attribute type of encoding depending on

492
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,790
where that URL goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

493
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">data workflow we have to do different</font>

494
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,659
defenses to really stop XSS when we talk

495
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,330
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the last couple of years</font>

496
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,940
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is even though this is what you</font>

497
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,879
say today in my mind this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the past</font>

498
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,490
it's not enough we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying first do</font>

499
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,350
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of canonicalization we do stay</font>

500
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,000
at to its simplest form that's just

501
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking a wall piece of input and</font>

502
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,070
decoding in every way we know we say

503
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,280
let's do HTML entity decoding utf-8

504
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:52,250
decoding URL decoding we've now reduced

505
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,310
data to its simplest form then do input

506
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:59,030
validation and then you output you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cody</font>

507
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:00,620
based on the context of display so what

508
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,110
this means is when you're taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

509
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,969
and you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a database you</font>

510
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,070
can't encode in a database for the most

511
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,050
part because that's assuming the world's

512
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,330
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be displayed so I recommend you</font>

513
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">do your outfit encoding in your template</font>

514
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,199
at the time that the partial boundary

515
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,689
when you're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually display</font>

516
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,730
that data to a user that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

517
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,410
the context that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can apply</font>

518
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,240
the right encoding and that's the right

519
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,250
place to deal with exercise for the most

520
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,800
part that's what we say today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

521
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,750
is what today's advice looks like we

522
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,149
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> different different</font>

523
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,680
contexts of where the data will go and

524
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you talk about a different encoding to</font>

525
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,670
apply back in 2007 2008 wizard is the

HTML sanitizer for PHP and other HTML

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,850
validation libraries<font color="#E5E5E5"> because here's an</font>

529
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,100
edge case if you're taking HTML input

530
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,270
from the user and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never use the</font>

531
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,750
tiny MCE widget in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> page</font>

532
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,750
with tiny MCE

533
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,559
exactly it tiny MCE will turn your text

534
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,800
area into a rich text editor as one HTML

535
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:18,710
widget it lets you bold underline color

536
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:21,899
the bullet lists and all kinds of rich

537
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,990
rich content modifications to a simple

538
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,570
text area when you submit a tiny MCE

539
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:35,300
text area what does that request

540
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:40,050
parameters submit as it's not plain text

541
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:42,750
that's HTML<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chunk of HTML how do</font>

542
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">we output in code HTML and still render</font>

543
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:48,840
it we can if you apply HTML entity

544
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,860
encoding to HTML it will just render as

545
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,370
the code and not actually do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark-up</font>

546
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:59,610
so how do we take a chunk of HTML from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

547
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,830
user and render it to another user in a

548
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,050
safe way this is a really common use

549
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:07,919
case in web development so we need to do

550
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:09,629
some kind of validation now HCM a simple

551
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,850
regular expression is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to cut</font>

552
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:15,030
it here we need a whole hot need a

553
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,919
high-end HTML policy-based validator

554
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,440
that lets you configure I'm except a

555
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,150
couple bold tags<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to accept</font>

556
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,910
italicized or underlined and there's

557
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,620
again there's tools like<font color="#E5E5E5"> J soup anti</font>

558
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sammy there's a few tools from PHP</font>

559
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,300
they're not perfect they were decent in

560
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,700
this air they at least reduce the risk

561
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of submitting HTML because most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

562
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,140
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ever saw they would take</font>

563
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">the HTML and just render it and that led</font>

564
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:45,420
to easy cross-site scripting mr.

565
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:48,900
fufferman yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they deliberately are they</font>

566
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,000
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2008 2009 they saw us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entice</font>

567
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sammy they made it they basically copied</font>

568
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,730
it for the.net architecture so we have a

569
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:59,490
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these api's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to handle</font>

570
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,600
this maybe this is 2007-2008 things have

571
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:05,750
changed a bit since then for example

572
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,320
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an first of all why is this</font>

573
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:11,390
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complete this is a trick</font>

574
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,539
question a difficult question but I'm

around this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're saying if you</font>

you're dumping it in a cascading style

here's the test case the test case shows

589
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:59,240
that when you have untrusted data when

590

you have an attempt three variable at

right we're good we're giving good

making serious mistakes in telling

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,080
developers how to stop cross-site

636

a real high-end smart guy and he

recently came out and said all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

people giving advice about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dom XSS is</font>

645
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:21,110
wrong Dom based XSS is when you make a

646
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,270
request you get a response and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

647
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:25,159
messing with widgets within the page you

00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,080
it's not a round trip back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

650
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's exercise that happens while you're</font>

651
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,429
interacting with the browser in an

652
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,500
asynchronous way and we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

654
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,340

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript so it's a much more difficult</font>

656
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,669
issue there's also javascript is also a

657
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">wide open language there's so many a</font>

658
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:51,500
dangerous functions that can execute

659
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,300
JavaScript like eval in set timeout it's

660
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,210
a much trickier problem when we deal

661
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,250
with down based XSS so Adam bus smart

662
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,440
guy I respect

663
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,380
great deal came out with this simplified

664
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,960
advice he said the initial page load the

665
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,570
initial page should be a simple static

666
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,720
content page you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a jack</font>

667
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:13,030
hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ajax hits to load JSON and then you</font>

668
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,730
should populate the beige with node that

669
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,889
text content document I'll create text

670
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,800
node an element<font color="#CCCCCC"> that set attribute and</font>

671
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,900
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Williams came at me and and</font>

672
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,300
smack me around and said oh you're down

673
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,070
based XSS cheat sheet is all wrong Jim

674
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,520
and you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give a simple advice</font>

675
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,080
like this and and I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> left given</font>

676
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,629
Jeff a hard time and I wrote him back

677
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,540
and told him why he was so wrong and and

678
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,030
I like Jeff element that said element

679
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,730
element that set attribute is basically

680
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:46,060
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most dangerous nut methods in</font>

681
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:48,970
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript the first element can</font>

682
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,820
be any<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript event handler or your</font>

683
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">URL context and then you can very easily</font>

684
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:57,580
in jet code to pop so this advice from

685
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">Boniface decent it's his overall</font>

686
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,280
architecture is right on but it's

687
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,020
trivial<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a program to use set element</font>

688
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,060
in a way that's incredibly dangerous

689
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,090
from a cross-site scripting perspective

690
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,010
so again the advice that I'm seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

691
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:15,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">the world experts out there myself</font>

692
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,790
included at times is is wrong or

693
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:21,090
incomplete because a lot of the security

694
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:24,430
guys are just that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security guys</font>

695
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,530
really new era folks to stop application

696
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:28,930
to to fix these problems of red

697
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,550
applications the security community is

698
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,620
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it I'm sorry we're not</font>

699
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't have that ability it's the</font>

700
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,300
developer error right now so it

701
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,669
developers don't engage and understand

702
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,100
and apply some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these techniques all</font>

703
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,720
hope is<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost in my opinion no web</font>

704
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,820
application firewall is going to solve

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem I've never found a web</font>

application firewall I couldn't bypass

707
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,110
in a couple minutes so I kind of see

708
00:30:51,130 --> 00:31:00,480
that as well as a myth well kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

709
00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:00,479
industry I hate to say no it's not

710
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:24,570
I concur I really do you don't always

711
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,389
have that luxury like if it's a cop

712

system it's a turnkey system we have to

713

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of lean on the vendor and do other</font>

714
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,480
things maybe use a web application

firewall to stop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bleeding make it</font>

716
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,440
harder to attack it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

717
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,810
situations where fixing the code is very

about it is to fix the code

00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,690
package<font color="#CCCCCC"> bundle up make sure that it's</font>

723
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:05,190
good has to sell out

724
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,220
so here's the here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem with</font>

725
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,800
today the problem is is that we as a

726
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,650
security community of doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad</font>

727
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,659
job of telling developers how to fix

728
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:18,150
these problems but yet the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the</font>

729
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term fix these problems is to is to</font>

730
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,170
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence developers to write</font>

731
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,990
code differently so it's that's why the

732
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,300
web is such a radically insecure place

733
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,190
today really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us security</font>

734
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,950
vendors really bad for those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who care</font>

735
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,600
about security though so Dom based XSS

736
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,960
we see adding bars where the world's top

737
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,480
guys in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic giving sketchy advice</font>

738
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,790
so here's the advice I think is best and

739
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,030
it's unfortunately not simple this is

740
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">written by Adam Adam Kong gave haze too</font>

741
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,450
far apart are you about 10 different

742
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,400
people like this guide and I'm just

743
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,920
showing you like about really less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

744
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,020
a third of it up on screen here you know

745
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,730
untrusted data I should only be treated

746
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,290
as displayable text you shouldn't be

747
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:03,780
driving data that is is I see like<font color="#CCCCCC"> phd's</font>

748
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,700
do this a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> but pass a function named</font>

749
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,800
as a parameter to dynamically call

750
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,740
functions you got to take those people

751
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,870
out back in Jack Bauer<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally</font>

thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that kind of cleverness</font>

753
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:19,229
almost always leads to insecurity the

754
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,629
best programmers of my mind the older I

755
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:26,280
get the more I code the Dumber my code

756
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:28,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is simple modular easy to maintain easy</font>

757
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,530
for newbies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at my code and and</font>

758
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,270
and use it and modify it over time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

759
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,310
think clever from a development point of

760
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,260
view is evil the best developers I know

761
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,990
the ones who write simple modular

762
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,150
maintainable code and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as not</font>

763
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,340
always as fun to write code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way but</font>

764
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,160
i think it's it's a better from an

765
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,110
engineering point of view avoid the eval

let's get this straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you do when</font>

802
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,650
you're using google analytics you're

putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a remote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript include on</font>

it into your browser and execute<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit oh</font>

but don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry we can just we can trust</font>

all of a sudden got evil or someone

810
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,830
hacked google and it was able to modify

811
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,290

of the year so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google got hacked or</font>

00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,250
Google got evil and they swapped out

to solve to fix that problem i'll reduce

including in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sights so again hey</font>

866
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,230
just to output<font color="#E5E5E5"> and coding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

867
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,810
cross-site scripting goes away ready no

868
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,630
way the problem is way more complicated

869
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:16,240
than that so here's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> view of how you</font>

870
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,130
stop cross-site scripting today and this

871
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,649
is the most important slide in this deck

872
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,510
I want you to grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> it copy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it steal it</font>

873
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,490
claim it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your own I don't care and</font>

874
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:26,230
pass it out to everyone because this is

875
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,060
the reality of how we stop cross-site

876
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,330
scripting today we walk through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

877
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:33,460
this is it important enough so another

878
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,440
night<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a numeric piece of</font>

879
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,230
data let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> user is having you an</font>

880
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,360
integer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a float some kind of numeric</font>

881
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,550
type and let's say you have a type-safe

882
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:47,710
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> will you buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type safe</font>

883
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:50,200
language developers PHP is there such

884
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,960
thing as an integer class<font color="#CCCCCC"> in PHP is</font>

885
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,270
really not<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the PHP variable it's</font>

886
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">always just a string but you can do</font>

887
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,590
validation to check if it's an integer

888
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,570
that's fine but a string is a string so

889
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,840
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have dimeric types in PHP</font>

890
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:07,300
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java if you have an integer variable</font>

891
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:10,120
is there a way for us to inject a string

892
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,310
into it it's just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible and in</font>

893
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java integer is an integer there's no</font>

894
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,590
way to embed a cross-site scripting

895
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,470
attack in a integer variable so in Java

896
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,450
if we have a new mail

897
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,430
very well you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry about</font>

898
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,618
this problem you just render<font color="#E5E5E5"> that energy</font>

899
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,109
wherever we want life goes on and we're

900
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">done now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have a type-safe</font>

901
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:33,480
language if we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font>

902
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,700
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of that encoding</font>

903
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,910
we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and other things so if</font>

904
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,689
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a string and the destination is</font>

905
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> body of an HTML document just to</font>

906
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,810
HTML entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding and that's the</font>

907
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,840
right thing to do if we have a string

908
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:51,660
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an HTML attribute</font>

909
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:55,260
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a formal template like velocity</font>

910
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,420
or or or some kind of formal template

911
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,310
language then you read any need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

912
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">encode the double quote in the single</font>

913
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,090
quote because we know that attributes

914
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,099
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quoted and that's enough now</font>

915
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,619
if we're in an open template like

916
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,720
javaserver pages or just so kind of PHP

917
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,790
template that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> right open with no</font>

918
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,740
structure that's forced we need to

919
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,270
account for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility that the</font>

920
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,240
developer may not quote their attributes

921
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:20,670
so if you're putting untrusted data in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

922
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,970
context without quotes they can use a

923
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:27,660
space to hop into a new context so in

924
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:30,299
the case of a quoted HTML attribute we

925
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,690
want to aggressively HTML entity in code

926
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,670
we even HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity encode spaces and</font>

927
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,740
pretty much everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> except for</font>

928
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,440
letters and numbers so we do aggressive

929
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,810
HTML attribute encoding now let the

930
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,420
players untrusted data is landing in a

931
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:49,140
get parameter like you have a hard code

932
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:53,220
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL as an href link I'm / site /</font>

933
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:55,740
feature ? data equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> blank and that</font>

934
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,230
that blank is coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request</font>

935
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,598
parameter that populates that ull that's

936
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:03,930
about to be clipped on makes sense so

937
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,210
that's in that case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want URL in code</font>

938
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:08,520
to stop cross-site scripting and still

939
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:11,520
at the feature work properly and the

940
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,130
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we used to say if someone</font>

941
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,740
sends you a URL just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

942
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,390
it that sounded really good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

943
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:20,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">security guy thinking because if you</font>

944
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,410
actually tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for three</font>

945
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:26,670
minutes you would see and we are shocked

946
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:28,799
like rains today I so I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give him</font>

947
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,859
a hard time I saw several other people

948
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:33,869
of his caliber saying to do URL encoding

949
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:36,990
of URLs even the last couple of weeks

950
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:38,220
that's flat-out wrong guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried it well</font>

951
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,319
they're just security<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys you know how</font>

952
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:47,339
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so Chuck joke attempt that here</font>

953
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,619
I'm sorry so if you take a URL and you

954
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,779
here L encode it and put it in an h RF

955
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:53,910
tag click a lot it nothing's going to

956
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:57,299
happen it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it just breaks the URL</font>

957
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,670
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an untrusted URL that's</font>

958
00:41:57,299 --> 00:42:03,180
coming from the third party here's all I

959
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:06,089
do it number one on input I do URL

960
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,220
validation if that URL is not properly

961
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,558
structured I reject the input and

962
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:14,069
haven't try again so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

963
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:16,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL is is a good ull we then</font>

964
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:19,319
check to make sure it's not a JavaScript

965
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:21,480
URL Papa browser you see if I can do

966
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:25,950
this quickly I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pop a browser</font>

967
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,710
here oh I think I think the latest

968
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of oh please do i'm like i'm</font>

969
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,920
probably get bit here i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

970
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:35,538
firefox just stop doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this which they</font>

971
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,539
did we try one more

972
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:49,810
a lot of browsers no longer supporting

973
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:53,470
this colon lit one one more try nope

974
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:55,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">there we're shutting it down the browser</font>

975
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,970
tonight so firing drive so far down here

976
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:59,740
probably do if what if I'm in security

977
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:05,560
just pop if i want to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> in security</font>

978
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:14,609
just pop an apple product sorry few

979
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:20,380
fanboys give me a five to five and then

980
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so yeah oh who gives up Apple</font>

981
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:29,320
fanboys raise your hand yeah yeah yeah

982
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:31,060
that was classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think my greatest</font>

983
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,240
moments as presented by the way ever

984
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:37,299
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so as we can see a</font>

985
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,750
javascript javascript colon is a real

986
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,580
type of URL every browser popped it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

987
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year ago they're starting to</font>

988
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,020
lock this down but so it unbounded in

989
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:49,029
the URL if I see JavaScript if it starts

990
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,009
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird javascript in anyway</font>

991
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,410
after I decayed it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

992
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">reject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well we also and now</font>

993
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:57,750
they're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> this URL and we're going</font>

994
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in an hf tab to be clicked on</font>

995
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,940
you do attribute encoding because the

996
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:05,830
search tag of an oven ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever a link</font>

997
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,560
is just an attribute it's a quilted

998
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,600
piece of data in a tag so we just do

999
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,910
attribute encoding and that you or I

1000
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,339
will be safe from cross-site scripting

1001
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:17,560
because you can have a URL with the

1002
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,920
cross-site scripting attack payload in

1003
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:23,470
it and it's still illegal URL so we have

1004
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,480
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> validate the URL and do the</font>

1005
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:28,118
proper output mikoni if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1006
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,119

based on where it lands it usually runs

your parsing<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON on the client in the</font>

1072
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:19,170
and if it's a modern browser you need to

use json.parse if it's an older browser

1074

you want to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON to library</font>

which has parsing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> json web site</font>

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,410
you're giving really bad advice in terms

of how to parse JSON<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

everyone back into the circle to give

good<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice to developers because when</font>

1089
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,190
it comes to security I don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1090
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,869
security people anymore I<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

1091
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,670
developers because that's is going to

1092
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:07,790
change the world today and I think that

1093
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:09,750
developers tend to be a lot more

1094
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,850
independent have a lot more knowledge

1095
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,310
about this specific technology than

1096
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,259
security people do with the kind of

1097
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,450
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that developers are solving day</font>

1098
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,340
in and day out are so complex already I

1099
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,750
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this stuff is that much more</font>

1100
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,700
complex than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're trying to pull</font>

00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">out already so I think it's accessible</font>

1102
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,359
knowledge if you're given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

1103
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,830
information and I daresay hopefully an

<font color="#E5E5E5">on-air</font>

way that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the right information</font>

1106
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:34,490
today to stop cross-site scripting

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future real quick my hope is that</font>

1109
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,320
when we look at cross-site scripting

1110
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,240
five or six years from now none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript correctly but my hope is</font>

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,299
between sandboxing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox's content</font>

years out we have a frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> horse encode</font>

1117
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,330
and infrastructure available to

<font color="#CCCCCC">this specific technology cross-site</font>

1120
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,340

1121
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,390
research content security policy

1122
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:16,000
probably the most important of all these

1123
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:18,290
technologies and you know what that's it

1124
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the Hawaii so we say Shaka brah</font>

I if you're not doing JavaScript you're

00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:47,109
not building websites today dart I'm

programming language is Google's

1132
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:53,859
evolution after JavaScript and I believe

1133

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a radically safe language</font>

compared to what we have today my hope

1135
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:00,490
is that something like dark gets a

1138
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,680
mostly we're just screwed we're screwed
