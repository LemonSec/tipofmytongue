00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">different talk in mind I knew when last</font>

54
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,670
year when i did this josh was going to

55
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,230
have me do it again this year and I was

56
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,700
gathering<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and interesting</font>

57
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,700
topics sort of throwing it into a big

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,260
bucket planning this talk and if I think

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,329
s was two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago James that</font>

60
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,530
sort of quartered me and said what is it

61
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be do you have a title I'm like</font>

62
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,350

63
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I throw everything in a bucket I</font>

64
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,590

65
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it fit add in bits and come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

66
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,250
talk and this was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was going</font>

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,780
to be but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy with what it</font>

68
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,450
turned out with hopefully you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as</font>

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,870
well so a little bit about me beyond

70
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,220
what mana was nice enough to say i

71
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,490
started out rife actually as a developer

72
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,070
in college station for an international

73
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,950
telecom<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's yeah woo international</font>

74
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,720
telecom whose main IT operations for

75
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,640
whatever reason we're in bryan-college

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,609
station although most of our business

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">was in Belgium France and other parts of</font>

78
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,580
Europe which is interesting because when

79
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,110
your app dies it's 2am here when it's

80
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,810
broken in the morning there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

81
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,550
good incentive to write good apps spend

82
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,440
some time as a DBA assisted man a pen

83
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,720
tester and now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call myself</font>

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,760
an application security a professional

85
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,890
you may see a little bit of bias about

86
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,320
linux and open source in this talk I've

87
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,208
been using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux primarily since 2000 as</font>

88
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,470
my main OS when I have a choice I am on

89
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:52,880
the board of Oh wasp<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ross foundation</font>

90
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,830
trying to help keep our mission

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,609
successful and now one of the security

92
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,010
peeps at Rackspace as of<font color="#E5E5E5"> october third</font>

93
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,600
so a couple of things right this talk

94
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,950
includes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> speculations and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dive into a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

96
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,280
subject areas some of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font>

97
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">all that much about so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i make</font>

100
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,010
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and diverse and the</font>

101
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,780
intention<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this talk is sort of expand</font>

102
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,579
your view of application security

103
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,529
writing to get you to think a little bit

104
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,709
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully so hopefully help you kind</font>

105
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,948
of

106
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,419
level up your app sex skills and the

107
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:28,970
views of this talk do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent</font>

108
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,770
owasp my employer the panhandler you saw

109
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving in today or anybody else right</font>

110
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,530
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talking about app sec and</font>

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,909
what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so let's do a wee</font>

112
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,799
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history way back in 2010 there</font>

113
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,569
was this last<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone thing and I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,789
keynote at it and at the keynote I tried

115
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> major points right number</font>

116
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,139
one software is everywhere right you

117
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,270
can't really live a life now without

118
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,889
interacting with software it's just it's

119
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,270
virtually impossible well maybe there's

120
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,009
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in West Virginia or</font>

121
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,389
something up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mountains but we're</font>

122
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">north George I used to live in Atlanta</font>

123
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,210
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people up there that don't</font>

124
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,969
have running water I doubt they have

125
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,650
software but for the most part it's hard

126
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,990
to interact in life now without touching

127
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,570
software second point I tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

128
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">right is that software has problems we</font>

129
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,080
all know this right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're in the tech</font>

130
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,440
industry one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons we get paid</font>

131
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,849
is because software<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't perfect and</font>

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,530
then the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I made last year</font>

133
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,030
was that Oh hostas visibility and one of

134
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,190
our key missions is to provide

135
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,138
visibility into the application security

136
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,240
space so that people can make informed

137
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,120
decisions either purchasing or using

138
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,389
software right so just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of</font>

139
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,639
recap software is everywhere this was so

140
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,380
good last year I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to repeat it Barbie</font>

141
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my daughter actually wanted this</font>

142
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,159
last Christmas and gosh darn it every

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,320
time I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the store they just</font>

144
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,789
happened to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> out it's terrible</font>

145
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,210
terrible thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the internet was also</font>

146
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:51,889
out of them had a stinking camera

147
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,780
embedded in her chest and you could like

148
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,449
use your Barbie to record things which

149
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just way too crazy and Big Brother II</font>

150
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,830
for me so regrettably Josie didn't get

151
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,809
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barbie now is embedded with</font>

152
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,620
software right and you can hack Barbie

153
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,840
if you want to

154
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,639
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube video of how this</font>

155
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,619
guy disassembled Barbie I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> love it</font>

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,900
right what'd you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this weekend I</font>

157
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,310
hacked Barbie I have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour a spy cam</font>

158
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,169
huh right fun stuff well there's a

159
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,699
butterfly's in jars this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> update</font>

160
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,109
from last year thinkgeek has these

161
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,270
things there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded chip up</font>

162
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,380
in the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this jar that since his</font>

163
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,630
motion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then makes these little</font>

164
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,850
butterflies flap their rings if it hears

165
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,889
or senses motion or sound right so we

166
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,570
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have electronic butterflies in a jar</font>

167
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:40,650
filled with software<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay software has</font>

168
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:43,260
problems oh yes this was december of

169
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,299
last year there was a programming error

170
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,159
which caused a Russian rocket to

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,570
actually fail to make it to orbit and

172
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,389
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of explode which is a bad thing</font>

173
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,760
right this is a software with problem

174
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,380
and this was a rather expensive problem

175
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,789
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a navigation satellite for the</font>

176
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,190
Russians which I'm sure isn't cheap in

177
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,729
rubles or dollars and that thing kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

178
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,080
fell out of the sky and went boom and

179
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:08,580
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year I talked about air france</font>

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,270
flight 447 that happened in 2009 it was

181
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,950
actually a flight from Brazil to Paris

182
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,780
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the Atlantic they</font>

183
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,490
suddenly lost the control of the plane

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it basically nose dived into the</font>

186
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,909
spent two years searching around for the

187

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,810
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like trying to find an item</font>

192
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,729
they actually have the black box and

193
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,270
what they've been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine is</font>

194
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:48,060
that yes there were two speed sensors

195
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,270
called patate or<font color="#CCCCCC"> P Toto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">plane for the autopilot there was some</font>

199
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
freezing on them and they started

200
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">arguing about what the real speed of the</font>

plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> was right side the left side said</font>

202
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,310
it was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the right the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right side</font>

203
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,080
said it was a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed and they</font>

204
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,750
literally were sort of fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> over how</font>

205
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,490
fast the plane was going the way the

206
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,620
software contended with this contention

207
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,710
and disagreement between the two sensors

208
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,630
was to turn off the autopilot the

209
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,310
captain was in the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a nap or</font>

210
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:23,130
resting he wasn't in the cockpit at the

211
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,890
time the two co-pilots were there they

212
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">struggled with the plane apparently the</font>

213
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,830
training for these planes does not

214
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,240
include what to do when the autopilot

215
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,760
shuts off when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're really high</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,720
air flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the Atlantic and</font>

217
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,729
unfortunate it seems like the pilot

218
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,410
pulled up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stick to high cost an</font>

219
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,450
aerodynamic stall and Babbitt went into

220
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,598
water so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a combination of software</font>

221
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,640
issues and pilot error<font color="#E5E5E5"> right though yeah</font>

222
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,990
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that guy it was May of</font>

223
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,580
this year that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled that</font>

224
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,150
guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the ocean which I'm blown</font>

225
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,350
away they were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

226
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,870
another issue of software having

227
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,960
problems this just happened last week

228
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,540
Jaguars were calling 18,000 cars because

229
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> software that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controls the cruise</font>

230
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,880
control has a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem</font>

231
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,260
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't turn off right that's</font>

232
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay they have a workaround they tell</font>

233
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,790
you to just turn off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignition at</font>

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,890
speed right which in some cases turns

235
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,079
off the power steering but you know hey

236
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,910
this is definitely an upgrade from the

237
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,500
price I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year that</font>

238
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,969
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> also suddenly accelerate and cause</font>

239
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,230
problems right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could a crash and</font>

240
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,240
die in a car that's a pretty sweet car

241
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,860
to crash and diet I mean way better than

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,540
a price I'm sorry I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,190
eco-friendly but hey sweet car ah what

244
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,660
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this visibility the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

245
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,250
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make last year is there's sort</font>

246
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,560
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Williams talked</font>

247
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,600
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think first one of the</font>

248
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,219
former board members of OAuth we have

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,840
the cycle where we implicitly trust

250
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,220
software right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a phone and you</font>

251
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,840
want a nap and you poke it a few times

252
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,760
and now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new app to do what</font>

253
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,140
you know Angry Birds right you poke your

Birds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now you can flick birds around</font>

256
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right you trust that that software</font>

257
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,959
is going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to do</font>

258
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,130
what it should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of blindly</font>

259
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,010
that's what we do that's what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

260
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,100
trained to do unfortunately in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

261
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,140
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that trust is it well deserved and</font>

262
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">one that when the app sort of fails us</font>

263
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,490
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to blame the software right</font>

264
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,170
we throw that the developers primarily

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,360
under the bus or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the producer of the</font>

software over the bus unfortunately for

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the developers are the the software</font>

268
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,310
producers that provides a huge incentive

269
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them to just sort of be quiet about</font>

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problems right you don't want to</font>

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,540
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems because the last</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about any problems with their</font>

software which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to feed into you</font>

276
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,450
blindly trusting it right because

everything is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right this is</font>

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,230
unfortunately very toxic to

279
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,310
reducing secure software this sort of

280
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:41,270
ecosystem of trust blame and hide

281
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:45,000
doesn't help us produce secure software

282
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,800
and also Jeff talked about this cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

283
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,130
visibility right we're all these

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,439
different pieces of the app sec puzzle

285
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,200
to make software they all need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

288
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,530
organizations there's a lot of silos and

group a doesn't talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> group B and it</font>

290
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,980
would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if we could all get</font>

291
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,870
along and to quote I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess who was the I</font>

292
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,580
forget the guy in LA who got beat up who

293
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,840
said can't we all just get along was

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy anyway can't remember his name</font>

Rodney King yeah Ronnie<font color="#CCCCCC"> King there you</font>

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,569
go can't we all just get along and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

297
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,979
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security facts thing</font>

298
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,170
where it's basically like a nutrition

299
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,770
label for software and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:29,010
really cool idea maybe we're not ready

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,600
maturity wise as an organ as a as a as a

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they have in here is like</font>

305
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,160
what are all the libraries used in your

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,810
software is that written anywhere where

<font color="#CCCCCC">you work do you know that you have lived</font>

software so that if there's a

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,720
vulnerability in one you might actually

312
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:51,270
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to trace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it back and patch your</font>

313
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,770
thing probably not so there's some

314
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,630
really good ideas embedded in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I</font>

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,819
would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go find Jeff's</font>

317
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,600
can point you out where it is the other

318
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,280
point I made and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">vision of the software industry right</font>

320
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,810
we're sort of like a boat out to sea

321
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,370
there's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugly iceberg out there and</font>

322
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,770
right now we're worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the top</font>

323
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,110
and the top bit is software

324
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,880
vulnerabilities right and yes those are

325
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,490
cool and sexy if you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're scary if you have them but quite</font>

327
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,390
honestly there's a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more that</font>

328
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,339
we're not even talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point into the</font>

331
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,079
just the security vulnerabilities what

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,050
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about things like change</font>

sundry things that it takes to produce

00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:46,489
secure software right they're not

340
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,239
particularly sexy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be honest with</font>

345
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:00,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">but quite honestly these are all</font>

346
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,779
important things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to do</font>

347
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:05,959
so I'm hoping at some point we can move

348
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,299
the conversation there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

349
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,529
that's a retrospective on last year

350
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:11,529
let's talk about what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do today</font>

351
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">steers was a bit high level I tried to</font>

352
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:18,990
inject some more real-world take this

353
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,350
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your organization and make</font>

354
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:25,740
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen right well my first thing</font>

355
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,199
is fail early and fail often right I

356
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:35,209
love this failure we can't spell failure

357
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:35,209
without you<font color="#E5E5E5"> right failure it's priceless</font>

358
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,230
failure coming to a face near you

359
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,240
failure failures are divided into two

360
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,250
cases those who thought and<font color="#E5E5E5"> never did</font>

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,110
and those who did and never<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I</font>

362
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">love that how do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">snow plow in the ice that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just--that's</font>

364
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,079
that's awesome i love this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too right</font>

366
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,489
you think that the guys who drive the

oscar meyer car the little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wienermobile</font>

368
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,000
didn't realize it's slightly bigger than

369
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">your average vehicle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the things</font>

370
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,820
of the bus basically shaped like a hot

371
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,769
dog then the epic fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know how</font>

372
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you flip over a tank but that's pretty</font>

373
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing because i know those are rather</font>

374
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,990
heavy devices but somebody managed which

375
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:22,600
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome really though all this</font>

376
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,070
talk about failure is I I think one of

377
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,260
the things we're doing as an industry is

378
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,540
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not learning from failure and it's</font>

379
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,939
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find examples of failure it's</font>

380
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,469
not so easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find examples of how</font>

381
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,480
we're taking that failure and trying to

382
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,480
derive some value<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it how can we</font>

383
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,190
learn from failure right and quite

384
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,260
honestly and this may be an American

385
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,940
thing it may be just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human thing but</font>

386
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,500
we worship at the altar of its success

387
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,880
right everything's like we got to

388
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,459
succeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> we gotta have you know no</font>

389
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,040
failure failure is not an option go go

390
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,540
go well<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite honestly they're generally</font>

391
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,060
speaking more failures and there are

392
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,620
successes so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick a class</font>

393
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,880
of things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from you might want</font>

394
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,070
to pick a class of things that happen

395
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,209
more often and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming there's no</font>

396
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,430
one in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has an empty</font>

397
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,099
bugtracker back home at the office<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

398
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,050
there's lots of failures we have lots of

399
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,310
opportunity to learn here and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

400
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unlike</font>

401
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,420
test-driven development right where you

402
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,189
write some test cases and they fail

403
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,439
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write code to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them pass</font>

404
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,470
right then that's actually a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> poof</font>

405
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,730
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop software right they</font>

406
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,829
could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot better software</font>

407
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,220
if we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people we're sort of had</font>

408
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,219
that mindset

409
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,780
oh yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not failed i just found</font>

410
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,510
10,000 ways that did wouldn't work do we

411
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,980
know who this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> edison yes this is</font>

412
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thomas Edison about the light bulb right</font>

413
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,030
he just<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't figure out a light bulb</font>

414
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,620
10,000 times but<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10001 apparently was a</font>

415
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:45,970
magic number and now we have light bulbs

416
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,430
and then interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee enough in April</font>

417
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:53,530
of 2001 the Harvard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Business Review had</font>

418
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:55,660
an entire an entire publication that

419
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,069
month was all about failure right how to

420
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,770
understand it how to learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

421
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,230
how to recover it so failure is maybe

422
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,199
the new black right hey let's embrace

423
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,460
the fail now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

424
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,840
fascinating things some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

425
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">articles you can pull for free some of</font>

426
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a paywall but it's a pretty</font>

427
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,530
good read one great example of failure

428
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually is somewhat applicable to</font>

429
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,089
software right Alan Mulally he was a

430
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,829
formerly at Boeing I can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

431
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">his position was he became the president</font>

432
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,400
and CEO at Ford and in 2006 when this

433
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,400
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford was not doing very well</font>

434
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,569
right they were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurting and he</font>

435
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,600
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and he said to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his direct</font>

436
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,680
reports look when we have meetings I

437
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,210
want you to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and in these</font>

438
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,339
staffs reports i want you to color code

439
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,530
them right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green if everything's</font>

440
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,820
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> red if everything's bad and you</font>

441
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,520
know origin yellow if there's some sort

442
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">of mix it between right stop light right</font>

443
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,530
red yellow green but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was fairly</font>

444
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,810
astonished at his first meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he</font>

445
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,350
saw a sea of green reports even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

446
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:59,380
Ford was losing several billion dollars

447
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">right how do you get a sea of green when</font>

448
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seven billion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars of losses</font>

449
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,560
there should be a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems you know</font>

450
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,360
that bubble up to the the upper level of

451
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,730
management right and unfortunately at

452
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,260
Ford there was not a culture that said

453
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,939
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to fail her to talk about</font>

454
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,069
problems we could only talk about

455
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,930
successes and quite honestly that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

456
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">really working for Ford when you're</font>

457
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,310
losing several billion a year that's not

458
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:24,430
a success even if you color it green

459
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,379
right so are your scrubs the sea of

460
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,570
green right do you have a culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

461
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,580
your organization where people can talk

462
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,720
about failures and not feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

463
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be branded as the guy who</font>

464
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,570
brought the news and therefore let's go

465
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,760
kill the messenger right can they safely

466
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,860
talk about problems because that's a

467
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,490
huge issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a nap sec people</font>

468
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,429
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the problems</font>

469
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's manage failure right and</font>

470
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,030
Amy<font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Edmondson in that Harvard Business</font>

471
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,100
Review wrote this article strategies for

472
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,170
learning from failure and she talked

473
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,850
about productive versus unproductive

474
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,710
failures<font color="#CCCCCC"> when there are some failures</font>

475
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,000
that that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you're not really</font>

476
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn from if you were driving</font>

477
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,840
here today and you ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a nail and</font>

478
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,219
you got a flat tire that's a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

479
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really it's sort of an act of God</font>

480
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,910
thing right you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to learn</font>

481
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,820
much from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you have 50,000</font>

482
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,010
mile rated tires and you're at 80,000

483
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,570
miles and it blows out there is

484
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,340
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could learn from that like</font>

485
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,860
maybe change out your tires regularly

486
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,790
when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to go that might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

487
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,229
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> clue right one of the other</font>

488
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,210
interesting things in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> article was</font>

489
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,370
she talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about testing early with</font>

490
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,570
rough prototypes and prototyping is not

491
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,610
anything new in the software industry

492
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,280
but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interesting things that</font>

493
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out of her research was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

494
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,530
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that users were much more Frank in</font>

495
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,990
their reporting of problems if what they

496
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,639
looked at didn't look fully baked right

497
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,950
if the prototype was pretty rough and

498
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,560
unfinished and it was obvious just from

499
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,630
observing it they were much more candid

500
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,429
than if they saw this final shiny thing

501
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,840
that they were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate and</font>

502
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is somewhat human</font>

503
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,720
nature not wanting to you know call

504
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,430
somebody's baby ugly in essence right

505
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,050
but so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a case where</font>

506
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,670
having those<font color="#E5E5E5"> rough and ready prototypes</font>

507
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,260
out in front of people early can

508
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,820
actually get you better results and

509
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,890
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an incentive to not</font>

510
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,899
have a really finished shiny prototype

511
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,670
before you show it off unfortunately

512
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,320
most people wait till it's just

513
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,660
pre-production before you do a user

514
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,250
acceptance test and that's not maybe the

515
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,490
best place to get the most candid user

516
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:25,470
acceptance responses right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

517
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,470
always learning from failures right

518
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,510
interesting thing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tartar group which</font>

519
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,980
is a large conglomerate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> india they</font>

520
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,940
actually have a prize for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

521
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:39,120
failed idea every year into it has

522
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,040
failed parties when the great idea that

523
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,260
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen they actually have a</font>

524
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,050
party around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they embrace it Ford</font>

525
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,240
Motor Company Henry Ford the original

526
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,850
founder at Ford Motor that we buy today

527
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,270
was his third motor company right two

528
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,439
failures the third one success right we

529
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,230
have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn from failure</font>

530
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for did good and Carter group and</font>

531
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,410
into it or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it okay to</font>

532
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,640
fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's let's talk about</font>

533
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,070
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world these are sort of</font>

534
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,570
high-level researching things let's talk

535
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,879
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> real world lessons from</font>

536
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,879
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and failure and get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drink</font>

537
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,010
you

538
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,330
okay so let's pick some recent large

539
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,549
failures and see if we can learn from

540
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,129
them like let's say the deepwater

541
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:29,200
horizon oil rig that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monumental</font>

542
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,390
failure and there's a few lessons we can

543
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">pull out of that and then also let's</font>

544
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,490
talk about Fukushima nuclear plant right

545
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,830
there's another case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some pretty</font>

546
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,539
spectacular failure so we have these two

547
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,520
failures that happen recently what can

548
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:46,510
we learn from them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can take home</font>

549
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,070
and put in our practices one thing let's

550
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,220
talk about expansion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and growth of</font>

551
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Technology right it isn't a nice linear</font>

552
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,380
smooth thing right it doesn't expand

553
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,909
like a balloon in all directions right

554
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:03,760
it's not a balloon it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even a cute</font>

555
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:06,190
horse balloon right the expansion is not

556
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,539
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's unevenly distributed right</font>

557
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology that just sort of</font>

558
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,840
happens in a direction and it's random

559
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,669
and there aren't associated technologies

560
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,240
that right along with it at the same

561
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,130
pace right usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> tech is expanding in</font>

562
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,659
a particular direction to solve a

563
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,610
particular problem and it's much more of

564
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:25,990
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point solution as well as opposed to</font>

565
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,908
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a a global solution which makes</font>

566
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,799
if you were to figure out a shape for

567
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:31,149
technology expansion much more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

568
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,330
urchin where you have these few

569
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,739
technology things going out there's a

570
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">core of so there were sort of solid</font>

571
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,340
technology but the rest the sort of

572
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:44,600
bleeding edge so to speak are those

573
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,580
fines so unfortunately that

574
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,110
lines are brittle and they sort of stand

575
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,310
alone right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a point solution</font>

576
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,080
for something you're worried about

577
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,940
solving that problem you're not worried

578
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,840
about sort of ancillary or tangential

579
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,040
problems right and when a spine breaks

580
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,260
right the tech to fix that problem

581
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,970
generally isn't available or it's

582
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,680
certainly not as mature right you

583
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how you were going</font>

584
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix the problem you were worried</font>

585
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
about well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were worried about how</font>

586
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,300
you're going to solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with</font>

587
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,350
technology you weren't worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

588
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,540
you're going to solve it when it breaks

589
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,090
which I mean come on Tekkit breaks we

590
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:16,850
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's what we have jobs right</font>

591
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at both the deepwater</font>

592
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,770
horizon and the Fukushima incident they

593
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,540
both had cases where the tech to fix the

594
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,600
problems was not nearly as mature as the

595
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,639
problems a the problems they had right

596
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,110
and then the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was driving</font>

597
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,090
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the solution of getting oil from</font>

598
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,520
really deeper in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fukushima</font>

599
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:37,010
making nuclear energy the tech around

600
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,360
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't quite up to speed and when</font>

601
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens right what you're left with</font>

602
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,669
is improv visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvisation right and</font>

603
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,100
a lot of floundering which was evident

604
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,200
in both those cases and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

605
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,909
of mess right<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you've relied on</font>

606
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,650
this little spine of technology to get

607
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,390
you out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the edge and solve a problem</font>

608
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,070
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when that thing breaks you're in</font>

609
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,780
free space right there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

610
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">support mechanism for you anymore and</font>

611
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happened i think in both of those</font>

612
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,900
cases so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look about some rules to</font>

613
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with tech failure right what you</font>

614
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:09,890
what can you get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fukushima and</font>

615
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,660
deep water<font color="#CCCCCC"> licky there we go number one</font>

616
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,060
right even if things<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem safe and</font>

617
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,740
secure in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> day-to-day basis disasters</font>

618
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,629
are going to happen and we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to</font>

619
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,450
live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this blue sky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> greenfield world</font>

620
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,370
but it's just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

621
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,820
usually disasters happen when they're

622
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:28,189
probably the worst possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> time right</font>

623
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,600
so how do you stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> this look for</font>

624
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,420
assumptions you've made and question

625
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,760
them right have you made assumptions it

626
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,920
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be true and or may not at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

627
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,180
be safe and think about them and

628
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,940
question them right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very low</font>

629
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,680
chance does it mean never and this bites

630
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,050
a lot of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh that'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never happen once</font>

631
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a blue moon well guess what every</font>

632
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,980
once a while you get a blue moon what's

633
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:55,040
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of</font>

634
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,300
deep water they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just assumed at great</font>

635
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,260
depths these blowout preventers we're

636
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,250
going to work because they worked at

637
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,020
shallower depths so

638
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,000
if we drop them another 10,000 feet

639
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,010
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was hey no problem it's</font>

640
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,330
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't quite work</font>

641
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:10,490
out fine and Fukushima was well just

642
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,840
generally a mess they thought partial

643
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,940
meltdowns were going to be unlikely they

644
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,550
had two sources of power one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

645
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,900
was grid the other was generators and

646
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,310
they just assumed at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

647
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,590
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be working well when</font>

648
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:23,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an earthquake that takes out</font>

649
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,709
power and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a tsunami that floods</font>

650
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,500
your basement where your generators are

651
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you suddenly don't have power right they</font>

652
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,580
didn't consider that it's an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

653
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:36,040
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key sort of chain of</font>

654
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,879
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> that made Fukushima go south to</font>

655
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,830
develop some broadly applicable

656
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,030
technology for mitigation before it's

657
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,949
needed you don't have to absolutely

658
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,810
solve the problem but at least think

659
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,210
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are we going to do if our</font>

660
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,250
API completely disappears in our load

661
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,440
balances lose their mind like what's the

662
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,170
Cy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-up plan at least have a plan</font>

663
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,430
right Fukushima had no idea what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

664
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,830
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost their two sources of</font>

665
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,740
power they were just they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in</font>

666
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,740
the open territory it was pretty awful

667
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,170
right if you did a threat model<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

668
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,640
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw some unmitigated risks those</font>

669
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,440
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things I'm talking about right</font>

670
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,570
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're as a business you decide</font>

671
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,890
we're going to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk but you</font>

672
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">should least have a conversation about</font>

673
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,940
okay what happens if this risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

674
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,220
does manifest I know it's very unlikely

675
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,690
but what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

676
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,000
have a plan so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

677
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:26,750
international sign of panic when the

678
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">inevitable happened oh and then yeah</font>

679
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,930
this is this is tech in perfect example

680
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,100
of tech right we have cross-site

681
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,840
scripting all the application

682
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,669
vulnerabilities out there and then we go

683
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,189
hey maybe we could have this mitigating

684
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">control called the laughs right that's</font>

685
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,810
sort of a carthorse mentality and

686
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,219
it'sit's backwards it would be better if

687
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could sort of think about how are we</font>

688
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,130
going to mitigate issues before we

689
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,449
actually make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know that</font>

690
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll ever get there but it sure would</font>

691
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,690
be nice

692
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:56,920
in the case of deep water right the the

693
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,020
technology to repair really deep leaks

694
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,420
is only now being researched because of

695
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,850
deep water right they realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gee</font>

696
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,860
these assumptions we made about those

697
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,840
blowout preventers really don't hold in

698
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,219
super deep water what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do</font>

699
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are now researching that as</font>

700
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,140
well as researching how do you clean up

701
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,510
freaking in more miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> spills in a</font>

702
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,590
somewhat safe and eco-friendly way right

703
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,350
those are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

704
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,500
never considered and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fukushima is</font>

705
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,240
shockingly they<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacked robotic access to</font>

706
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,640
some areas so when they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show off</font>

707
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,610
some of the valves it was to radioactive

708
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,800
to send in people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no way to</font>

709
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,360
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> those valves and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

710
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,970
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch and I think a</font>

711
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,860
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> god bless them took</font>

712
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,060
the hit and went in and turned off those

713
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,250
valves and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to live a much</font>

714
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,389
shorter life for doing that but it's

715
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,710
kind of shocking than<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a nuclear</font>

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">reactor you don't have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

717

robotic access to areas that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

718
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,310
highly radiated radio fide radiation

high levels of<font color="#CCCCCC"> radiation something like</font>

720
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was kind of surprised when</font>

721
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,919
I started reading into that they just

722
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">they didn't think about that I mean it's</font>

723
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,800
a nuclear reactor there's a high chance

724
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,390
there's going to be high<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels of</font>

725
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">radiation in there and robots are kind</font>

726
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,269
of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> with radiation certainly much</font>

727
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,249
better than humans and

728
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:11,190
number three situational<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness is</font>

729
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:13,679
invaluable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to work with the ex</font>

730
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,029
military guy and he kind of knew this i

731
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,320
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it was a military</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID but</font>

732
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:18,599
don't have any military in my background

<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know if this is a military thing</font>

734
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,799
that they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> teach you because I don't</font>

00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that experience but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got this and</font>

736
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,789
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't get</font>

737
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:29,219
this knowing what's going on it's a huge

738
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:31,289
part of solving the problem and in a lot

739
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:33,330
of cases when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer</font>

740
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:34,499
the what's going on you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez I</font>

741
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,059
don't know I guess we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of look</font>

742
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:38,789
over here I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we logged something</font>

743
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:41,399
over there and not you do but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

744
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,599
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have situational awareness so what</font>

745
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,149
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now happening to your</font>

746
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:48,718
application you know is somebody trying

747
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:51,029
to pop it is it doing fine is it eating

748
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:55,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">up all the CPU on the server what's</font>

749
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:57,899
going on most people no clue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app</font>

752
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:06,479
patient with me deepwater horizon they

753
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:08,969
had a single gauge to monitor the

754
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:11,129
blowout preventer one gauge<font color="#CCCCCC"> at whatever</font>

755
00:28:08,969 --> 00:28:13,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy depth that was and this is not</font>

756
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:14,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a OG that the gauge is gone let me</font>

757
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,070
go put on my wetsuit and run down there

758
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:19,468
and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or let's pull up the how many</font>

759
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,029
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feet of pipe right it's</font>

760
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:23,459
pretty shocking when i read that that

761
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:26,190
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single gauge to monitor that</font>

762
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:28,999
thing pretty pretty amazing because

763
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:31,139
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixing it was not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and</font>

764
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:33,269
fukushima well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just lacked</font>

765
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:35,369
situational awareness generally right

766
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:36,690
that was just a mess I don't want to

767
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:38,070
beat them up anymore that's an easy

768
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,019
target it's like it's like beating up

769
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,458
your sister that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was situational</font>

770
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,440
awareness wise i didn't have meters to

771
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:46,289
find out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much radiation was leaking</font>

772
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it did leak it just ah yeah it was</font>

773
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:53,639
a mess so if you assume these rules are

774
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:55,019
worth following right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

775
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:56,668
people to follow these rules well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

776
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,369
think inevitably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sort of choices</font>

777
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:01,499
are as an industry we can self-regulate

778
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,908
or as an industry we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

779
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:04,859
have to accept what government comes up

780
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,719
with and there's already examples of

781
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:08,099
this right think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright the</font>

782
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:10,440
payment card industry was sick and tired

783
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:11,849
of getting popped for losses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

784
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they do they self regulated they</font>

785
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:17,158
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the PCI DSS standards right</font>

786
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,629
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> better or worse they exist now</font>

787
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:19,879
and then if you handle credit card data

788
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:23,629
you have to deal with them

789
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:25,189
right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> those solve a particular</font>

790
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:27,859
problem now the one thing that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

791
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,869
scares me<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI is when you hear not</font>

792
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:32,809
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem being solved with PCI</font>

793
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:34,789
oh we have a data privacy issue we'll

794
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,649
just use the PCI standards well wait a

795
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,149
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may not apply pc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

796
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,708
was worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing financial money</font>

797
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,689
they were worried about credit card and

798
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:43,819
data security they weren't necessarily

799
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,219
solving your problems so government

800
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:48,619
regulation at some point scares me a bit

801
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,909
and quite honestly it's really tricky to

802
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:52,009
determine what the right level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

803
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,839
regulation is right where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that magic</font>

804
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,969
line between it's enough to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

805
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,249
honest and it's not too much to actually

806
00:29:55,969 --> 00:30:00,469
be a drain<font color="#E5E5E5"> on business right that's a</font>

807
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:02,539
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tough road super gray area who</font>

808
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:04,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">who that knows so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of those</font>

809
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:06,259
things where unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm kind of</font>

810
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:07,908
hoping we self-regulate because at least

811
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:10,519
we can change probably faster than

812
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:12,440
government we hope well PCI's ramp

813
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,699
several times so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently we can</font>

814
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,559
change faster than government ah another

815
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:20,539
thing about when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started sort of</font>

816
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,799
researching into this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's</font>

817
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:23,779
this thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't aware of called</font>

818
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,069
safety case regulation and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

819
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:27,609
of an interesting idea and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

820
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:31,249
fairly applicable<font color="#CCCCCC"> into building software</font>

821
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:33,889
that I the idea here right is instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

822
00:30:31,249 --> 00:30:36,259
following a checklist of mandated things

823
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:38,569
right a guideline of what have you a

824
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:41,809
list right these are the end number of

825
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:43,639
things you must do instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

826
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,190
turn it around and you say you explain

827
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:47,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me why the system is safe under all</font>

828
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:52,269
possible conditions what have you done

829
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:52,269
to handle these possible conditions

830
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,410
think about it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute oh wait let</font>

831
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:01,080
me my head of<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huh and by the way</font>

832
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">put this case in writing and in some</font>

833
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,560
cases get it signed so management

834
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,590
realizes how they've accepted risk and

835
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,470
what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and then</font>

836
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,389
also take those cases if you say you're

837
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,420
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input validation by</font>

838
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,670
output encoding test it right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

839
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,740
actually have a means to test what they

840
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,750
say they're going to do this can sort of

841
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,120
guide your testing when you're actually

842
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,530
testing the well in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case the</font>

843
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,899
regulatory issue but this could also

844
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,480
apply to software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to me this sounds</font>

845
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,890
a whole lot like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a threat model right is</font>

846
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,570
what's a threat model you talk about

847
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's going on with the software and</font>

848
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">what mitigations you have for threats</font>

849
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,510
you put it in writing and maybe it's

850
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,920
signed off or not right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if</font>

851
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,379
you're smart you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand that to your</font>

852
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,120
pen testers and they can find weak areas

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,740
of the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and test those because a</font>

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,460
model stage or implementation they're

856
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,110
not the software isn't written yet but

857
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,000
you know these are weak areas if your

858
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,090
resource can train for constrained for

859
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,710
testing which everybody is this is a

860
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,970
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to focus that testing and get</font>

861
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,130
the most bang for your buck now the one

862
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,080
thing a safety case regulation is it

863
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,850
requires long-term relationships right

864
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,949
it's sort of hard to just drop in a body

865
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,889
and have them talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the safety case</font>

866
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,330
of a particular regulatory body and it

867
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the same thing for software if</font>

868
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,510
you're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop in and talk to</font>

869
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers you probably don't have the</font>

870
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,280
street cred with them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

871
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,630
maybe maybe not it kind of depends the

872
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,250
other thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decent</font>

level of expertise right you can't if

00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing about software you're</font>

875
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,520
not really going to be a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font>

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,020
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing threat modeling even if you</font>

877
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,620
did read the book right unfortunately

878
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:39,900
that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case right issues with</font>

879
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">this well this is problematic when you</font>

880
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,700
have systemic failures right like think

881
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a bank right if a bank fails not only</font>

882
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,640
does a bank fail but there can be

883
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,990
cascading failures people have money in

884
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,180
the bank lose money that can cause a

885
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,120
subsequent failure right so in cases

886
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,430
like that this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work very well</font>

887
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,219
and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right it's sort of a</font>

888
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:01,470
combination of collegial and

889
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,820
confrontational right half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font>

890
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,650
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat modeling this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

891
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,520
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> right half of it you're sort</font>

892
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,260
of one

893
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,580
with the developers you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI feel</font>

894
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,750
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pain how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to work</font>

895
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">around this problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other part</font>

896
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,750
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of confrontational</font>

897
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,880
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of calling the baby</font>

898
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,500
ugly and threat modeling like why did

899
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
you do this this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to</font>

900
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,870
me right so there's some interesting

901
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,080
parallels and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting twists</font>

902
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,219
that i found on safety regulation right

903
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,280
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only make a case for</font>

904
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,020
safety have<font color="#CCCCCC"> they make the case for how</font>

905
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,430
they're going to react to failures right

906
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,260
what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen when something</font>

907
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes wrong you say you have this</font>

908
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,129
mitigation let's say it goes away right

909
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,440
we have these unfixed vulnerabilities in

910
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,790
our app we bought a laugh therefore it's

911
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,210
fixed well that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if the</font>

912
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,200
laugh dies right let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

913
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,580
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to handle those</font>

914
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,180
failures because they're probably going

915
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,220
to happen right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just basically</font>

916
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,680
saying how are you going to fail when

917
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,660
that brutal spine of technology breaks

918
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,250
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of an open water in</font>

919
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,380
between the spines where there's no real

920
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,570
tech to save you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so think</font>

921
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,960
about the unthinkable right what's going

922
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen</font>

923
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,889
handling software failures that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

924
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,359
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit high level in general let's</font>

925
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,580
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about software failures right</font>

926
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,379
perfect software right we would all like

927
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,389
it and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> practice and</font>

928
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">practice and practice and eventually</font>

929
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,290
we're going to have our<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest-based API</font>

930
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,908
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be beautifully humming</font>

931
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:26,040
along and our SOA<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to handle</font>

932
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,379
requests carefully and it's just

933
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,290
beautiful orchestrated thing right but

934
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:34,649
inevitably the disaster is going to

935
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:36,300
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it never fails these</font>

936
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:38,580
are professional skaters I imagine they

937
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,619
skate a lot and this still happened

938
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,989
right and guess what this happens with

939
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,929
our software so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is</font>

940
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:47,040
when the inevitable happens where what

941
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,240
are you going to do with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

942
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,719
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make around</font>

943
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,719
failure

944
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,350
it's not if your software has problems

945
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,870
his software has problems that's a given

946
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:01,450
what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case is how you react</font>

947
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems right and if you can</font>

948
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,569
have an honest and open environment

949
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,830
where problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be talked about you</font>

950
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,270
have a much better chance of having a

951
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,450
happy face as opposed to a freaked-out

952
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,450
face

953
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:14,970
by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was searching for reaction</font>

954
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,500
photos for this page and Google Images

955
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,879
and I just had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this in I'm</font>

956
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,280
interrupting my own slide deck<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

957
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,200
awesome the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction ball for nine</font>

958
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,520
ninety five and ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> report points you</font>

959
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get the action ball where you and</font>

960
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friends can dress up an athletic</font>

961
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,339
clothes and bounce a ball to each other

962
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,660
I just I couldn't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I had</font>

963
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it in that was just like the</font>

964
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:37,109
reaction ball that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome it's fun</font>

965
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:43,980
for a boy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a girl so let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

966
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:46,410
little bit how not to react<font color="#E5E5E5"> right ah and</font>

967
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this just happened last week or the week</font>

968
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,009
before I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember the exact timing</font>

969
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">of its in the last couple of weeks</font>

970
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,859
Patrick Webster this guy in Australia

971
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,910
there's this thing called the

972
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,560
superannuation which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand</font>

973
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:00,690
because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> never been to Australia but</font>

974
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,220
apparently it's the sort of federal

975
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,390
government or the Australian

976
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,310
Government's mandatory retirement

977
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,618
program right you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these like</font>

978
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,810
superannuation companies that hold your

979
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,840
retirement somehow I guess sort of like

980
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,790
a federal level 401<font color="#E5E5E5"> K ish sort of thing</font>

981
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,890
I don't perfectly understand it but

982
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,570
luckily it's not important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font>

983
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,569
point of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story but Patrick Webster</font>

984
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,190
he's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia and he has this</font>

985
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,600
federal or government mandated

986
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,810
retirement plan with first state

987
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,350
superannuation right and he found this

988
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,779
crazy ridiculous simple flaw<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

989
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">website in fact what he did is he was</font>

990
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,530
pulling a report of his I think

991
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:41,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">deductions or something for previous</font>

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:43,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">month and he noticed a numeric ID in the</font>

993
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,009
in the URL and he like added one to it

994
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,200
and sure enough his<font color="#CCCCCC"> coworker statement</font>

995
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,420
came up he and his co-worker had hired

996
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,359
at the same time and they incremented

997
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,820
their ID number by one he thought oh

998
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,819
dear god this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bad and this is</font>

999
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,490
like web at mistake 101 so he's actually

1000
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,410
he's in the business he's a research or

1001
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,810
a pen tester so he wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little shell</font>

1002
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,368
script to test this out and pull down it

1003
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,810
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> either five hundred or a hundred I</font>

1004
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:11,190
don't remember how many but to pull out

1005
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,820
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them to see if it was just it's</font>

1006
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,850
like an oddball<font color="#E5E5E5"> chancer is this really a</font>

1007
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,780
app wide problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made some tea</font>

1008
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,819
comes back and sure enough he has a

1009
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,470
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred records they says</font>

1010
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,150
who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he calls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and reports</font>

1011
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,529
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font>

1012
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,119
guys who talked to it first we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1013
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:29,069
super oh this is great thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh my</font>

1014
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,750
goodness is terrible we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixes they</font>

1015
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:33,299
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with it but apparently it</font>

1016
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,880
bubbled up to management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

1017
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:37,890
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that reaction was right well</font>

1018
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,029
first off they sent the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> to his</font>

1019
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:43,348
house right presumably for breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1020
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:45,630
law though when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the police</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> investigate</font>

1021
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah nothing</font>

1022
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">really happened they also asked for all</font>

1023
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,710
of his computers to be turned over to

1024
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,680
them so they could verify that there was

1025
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:56,910
no more client data on their machines

1026
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,348
these are the people who can't write the

1027
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,730
web app good enough to not be vulnerable

1028
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:01,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they want to check your machine to</font>

1029
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure you deleted it and by the way</font>

1030
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy's a pen tester has had the data</font>

1031
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,970
for how long if you wanted to keep that

1032
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,890
data it's already kept right five

1033
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:14,848
minutes oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go fast</font>

1034
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:16,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when many had lawyers send a nasty</font>

1035
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:18,599
letter to him right saying you broke the

1036
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">law we're closing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your account and they</font>

1037
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually want him to pay to fix the</font>

1038
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:25,020
problem he found right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not how</font>

1039
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">to react right this is insane in this</font>

1040
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,470
came this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got viral in the</font>

1041
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:29,990
australian press they got then this

1042
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,859
company got tons of bad press and

1043
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,250
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened was a lot of</font>

1044
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:37,710
let's call them pro bono testers started

1045
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,260
testing the site and then dropping what

1046
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,000
they found on full disclosure right this

1047
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction you want right the</font>

1048
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,920
lesson here don't do this and if you

1049
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,990
have people upstream from you that are

1050
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,430
losing your mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry your security</font>

1051
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,229
professional it's your job to talk them

1052
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,940
off the cliff and not let them do this

1053
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:56,579
to your company because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did not</font>

1054
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,230
help first superannuation at all right

1055
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,970
so how should you react well we have bug

1056
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,700
bounties right and quite honestly just

1057
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,169
good plain common sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Mozilla</font>

1058
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,399
they have these in place and they've

1059
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:09,059
been highly effective it's a way to

1060
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,789
incentivize<font color="#E5E5E5"> a responsible disclosure and</font>

1061
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,839
I think it's a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1062
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:15,299
internally right can you have some sort

1063
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of premium a free cup amarga anything</font>

1064
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:19,680
ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars at the company store for</font>

1065
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,118
people that report software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1066
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a culture where people aren't</font>

1067
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,369
afraid to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and avoid</font>

1068
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,020
that sea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of green like happened to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford</font>

1069
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,980
testing failures right this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1070
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,319
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been bothering me for</font>

1071
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,150
a long time testability of software

1072
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,259
right because in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that design review you</font>

1073
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,819
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about how you're going</font>

1074
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,400
to test this eventually when it gets the

1075
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:38,710
you know

1076
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,920
pre prod and then prod right that's all

1077
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">what sorted no it isn't right where are</font>

1078
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,119
you going to test it how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going</font>

1079
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:47,980
to test it can you create accounts of

1080
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:49,539
their weird dependencies right to test

1081
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">this API you have to have an account on</font>

1082
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:52,510
this system with also has to have an

1083
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,270
account on this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that even</font>

1084
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,859
known right and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in that</font>

1085
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,538
you're testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is it real data is</font>

1086
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:00,940
it pushed from production how does that

1087
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,529
work that's kind of a big mess and guess

1088
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,440
what testing will happen it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1089
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:06,609
matter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> when and where pre fail</font>

1090
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,750
warnings this is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things I</font>

1091
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:10,058
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the app sensor</font>

1092
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:11,470
project right this is situational

1093
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:14,440
awareness for your apps and I think this

1094
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:16,058
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hugely powerful idea it talks about</font>

1095
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,380
50 different detection points that you

1096
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">can place in your apps where you can</font>

1097
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,309
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get a hint that things are going</font>

1098
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,640
wrong it tells you some guidance on how

1099
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:27,160
to respond and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can take actions like</font>

1100
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">logout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a sim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walk the</font>

1101
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,649
account kill their session right and

1102
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,210
then it talks about thresholds maybe the

1103
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,500
third time they do this sort of bad

1104
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,819
thing you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock it up but they</font>

1105
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a couple chances because you're not</font>

1106
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:41,079
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's bad right and you can</font>

1107
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:43,240
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's happening to your</font>

1108
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:44,829
app and actually Michael coats a guy who

1109
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">started this project has done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1110
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:49,839
thing for Mozilla<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're pushing</font>

1111
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,940
app events to their sin and in real time

1112
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,650
ish they can tell what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1113
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,089
their apps which is fundamentally

1114
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,700
awesome and that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font>

1115
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:59,349
and it's the framework stupid right if

1116
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,520
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> picking a framework you might</font>

1117
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,349
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually look to see if the</font>

1118
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,970
framework has talked about security and

1119
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:06,160
luckily they're starting to get the itch

1120
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,839
right the list framework and web 2 pi

1121
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,819
actually talk on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their websites how they</font>

1122
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,440
handle the<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh lost top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 the.net</font>

1123
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:13,299
framework has consistently added

1124
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,039
security features over time that's

1125
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:19,150
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool because now developers get</font>

1126
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">it for free and don't buy fail right use</font>

1127
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,369

do this and require testing prior to

internal if you have the

community and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting research</font>

1161

that came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT the university of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of incentivizing people which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we give</font>

extra dollar and they found<font color="#CCCCCC"> out which</font>

1168
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,239
didn't make sense was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a larger</font>

reward when you're doing a task that

1170
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,529
requires some creative thinking or mild

1171
00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:00,160
cognitive skills it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually leads the</font>

1172
00:42:56,529 --> 00:43:01,869
worst performance which defied the laws

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,970
of behavioral physics and confuse the

1174
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:05,170
heck out of these poor guys right this

1175
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:07,538
is Texas right it's a real

1176
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,180
head-scratcher they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">do with this well they did some more</font>

1178
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,509
research and what they found out is the

1179
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,630
factors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that lead to better performance</font>

1180
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:18,579
is autonomy right if you're doing a

1181
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,170
creative role you want to tana me you

1182
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:21,579
have a desire to be self-motivated and

1183
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,900
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be micromanage and</font>

1184
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,690
that shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be any surprise to</font>

1185
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,759
anybody in here mastery right you have

1186
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,440
the urge to master something this is why

1187
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:31,119
people that are not musicians go buy a

1188
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,549
guitar and every weekend twiddle around

1189
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,509
on it and slowly get better right it's

1190
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:36,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think you're going to</font>

00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:52,029
these for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our community so this is a</font>

1199
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:53,619
huge thing they did they did some more

1200
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:55,269
studies which that different words

1201
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:57,400
around it you may see challenge mastery

1202
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:59,140
making a contribution but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in essence</font>

1203
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,480
it's all the same and this is something

<font color="#CCCCCC">that a toe wasps we can give you and</font>

incredibly fantastic and the slides will

1210
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,590
be available for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference because</font>

1211
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,820
you don't have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write that down I</font>

1212
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:21,470
imagine a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time anyway and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> omas</font>

1213
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:23,180
almost as a meritocracy right I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1214
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,709
on the board but I have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1215
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,319
power and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibilities and</font>

1216
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:29,840
no pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's honestly how it works the</font>

1217
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,850
power and olas does not me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not Tom</font>

1218
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,350
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> board member it's our community</font>

1219
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,880
it's the people running the chapters

1220
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,589
Josh and James have run the Austin

1221

1222
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I'm here talking write a chapter</font>

1223
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,930
decided they wanted to do a conference

1224
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,600
and now we're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second year of last</font>

cotton and next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> apsa QSR is here</font>

1226
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,610
that's because of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people in one</font>

1227
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,270
town right with olas you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1228
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:58,420
a difference final thoughts right some

1229
00:44:53,270 --> 00:45:01,820
may ask is failure an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say</font>

1230
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,980
failure is everywhere right you can't

1231
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,800
avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure and under those</font>

1232
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:11,780
constraints let's find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to find</font>

1233
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,010
success through failure questions I have

1234
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,650
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea where I'm on time where am I</font>

1235
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:17,000
time I'm out of time no questions I do

1236
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,190
this because I have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids that like</font>
