our own enjoys just for the sake of time

3
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,420
we've called to say three different

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,640
things when we did this talk in Vegas it

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,699
was how to hide your porn you know when

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,140

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,609
Brother using distributed steganography

9
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:31,470
so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last slide deck and here</font>

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,329
i guess recall you at any technique in

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,000
data exfiltration and confidentiality

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:42,090
and that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tight us we're</font>

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,300
getting away with this one oh so maybe

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,210
my work<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah all right it would help if</font>

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,839
i put batteries in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so who i</font>

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,960
about security more importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,689
to worry about security so for me this

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,169
was just a fun project<font color="#E5E5E5"> lancer descaler</font>

30
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,369
my company does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not endorse this this</font>

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,890
talk I'm not William

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,510

34
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:44,110
it so all right so project beginnings we

35

happy hours every<font color="#CCCCCC"> six month we sit down</font>

37
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,640
we talk about really good stuff and that

38
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,789
this really really really happen to be

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,690
talking about Heidi report how that came

40
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,120
up have no idea but oh no no not started

41
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,100
talking and somehow we brought up<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">dayley poll that asked him besides and</font>

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,990
we started talking about you know how

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,240
how do we go about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I with</font>

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,740
steganography and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I basically wrote in the base of what's</font>

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:17,140
now known as stay up so this was a quote

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,730
when we do this abuse a las vegas

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chrismukkah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show is the organizer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,640
conference and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said in his podcast he</font>

51
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,920
actually said the exact library podcast

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,690
fuck yeah internet is awesome why

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,850
because it gets you your port so I

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought it was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very apt quote for this</font>

55
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:38,920
presentation so so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what is born</font>

56
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,570
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sets different for different</font>

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,309
people with weird considering porn in

58
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,109
this talk is data that's worth holding

59
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,030
on team or any data that's worth

60
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,720
protecting and hiding so that's what we

61
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,130
consider pointing this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

62
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,480
how not to hide your point i'll let you

63
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:58,420
go of this so these are such things that

64
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,250
work fairly well but these things are

65
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,440
the common measures against ways that

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,520
people can detect this<font color="#CCCCCC"> what not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing was hidden files and</font>

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,670
directories right and if you'll notice

69
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,350
there might be this little hitting guy

70
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,480
and will need to click it you don't see

71
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,060
the file in the directory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah mom</font>

72
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,859
doesn't find it right unfortunately

73
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,870
their way is player ways to list out

74
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,550
that there's a door commander with a

75
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,590
flag that can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> show these files</font>

76
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,450
and those directors so if you're trying

77
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hide for mom this is fun if you're</font>

78
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,440
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from everybody else</font>

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,700
probably not good so the second thing

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,829
you can do is rename the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flower</font>

81
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,690
extension this is more of an obfuscation

82
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,240
technique than anything else but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

83
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,400
have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG</font>

84
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">name it to a PDF then nobody's none the</font>

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,450
wiser unless fight name it something

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,620
weird like horse something dot PDF so

87
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,720
the other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is just</font>

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,610
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> et hide it with something else</font>

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,950
right so you have a big directory folder

90
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,350
images<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's a video editing</font>

91
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,060
program or<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Adobe or something like</font>

92
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,920
that lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of images in there naturally</font>

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,420
so you stick your files in with

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,220
everything else and nobody finds it

95
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,470
again this will probably hide it from

96
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,900
mom and dad over here whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

97
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,750
don't hide it for a law enforcement or

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,880
something like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can bear it</font>

99
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,070
several directories down this was on the

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:16,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet again why this is on the</font>

101
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nickel</font>

102
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">since the era is also my yeah sorry ways</font>

103
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,150
you can bear it several directors down

104
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,280
right this was a trick I used when I was

105
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,929
a kid and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want my parents to find</font>

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had yeah I create a</font>

107
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,110
directory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then create several sub</font>

108
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,969
directories I created like weird

109
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,370
passwords based out of directors and

110
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot it worked great until fine came</font>

111
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,690
out and they were able searching you

112
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,950
have fun that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

113
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,290
text it with other files are compressed

114
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,150
format usually if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm you abundant</font>

115
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,270
because fun doesn't search these zip

116
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,909
files but if you go you compress it

117
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,409
sticky or zip file it makes a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

118
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,880
harder right so I matt has to finalize

119
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,210
if i'll open it know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

120
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,010
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alter the data</font>

121
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,380
streams is a really cool feature are you

122
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,920
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can basically create</font>

123
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,360
a file like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up account log and</font>

124
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,310
then you can create what's called an

125
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,290
alternate data stream so we have that

126
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,360
original file and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> create this</font>

127
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,360
alternate data stream that basically

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,220
appends to that file similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> row of data</font>

129
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,540
this works very well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do a dir</font>

130
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,000
or something like that or directory

131
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,950
listing this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up the problem</font>

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,560
is if you know the right fag like this /

133
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,950
our flag then it does come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so it only</font>

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,300
works in certain cases right spam mimic

135
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,650
this was something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found while I</font>

136
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,900
was digging in doing the research for

137
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,620
the sky so spam mimic is really really

138
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,810
cool what it does is

139
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,990
put in a message right and in my message

140
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,970
i put the password is<font color="#CCCCCC"> prawn what happens</font>

141
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,639
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> magnetic takes that message it</font>

142
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,889
encodes in this crazy email that looks

143
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,410
exactly like span<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take that message</font>

144
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to somebody and a my mantra</font>

145
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,639
your emails and then the wiser right it

146
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,100
looks like spam I can't find the

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,720
password in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can plan on in here I</font>

148
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't find any of that stuff we're</font>

149
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">making through this but somehow spam</font>

150
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,370
mimic actually knows what how to format

151
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,169
that and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that right here's</font>

152
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,090
the encoding it'll take that and put it

153
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the decode form so if you know</font>

154
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,049
if Orlando<font color="#CCCCCC"> and are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanging messages</font>

155
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:15,550
back and forth we can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> our messages</font>

156
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,960
in a spam send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back and forth</font>

157
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,550
nobody knows what's going on there

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,919
hidden partitions so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

159
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,979
create a partition in your file system

160
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,960
that nobody sees well that's really good

161
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,490
right I can hide stuff on there I can

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,739
make it so that nobody sees it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

163
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,050
hidden partition and then you basically

164
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,039
unhide it when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go and do</font>

165
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,680
something there so another way hot stuff

166
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,760
very similar invisible partitions

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,710
slightly different way to create this

168
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,430
but the same general concept right will

169
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:50,680
create a partition<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nobody can see</font>

170
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,690
slack space this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so when</font>

171
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,880
you create a file what ends up happening

172
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that allocates a</font>

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,500
sector or multiple sectors for that file

174
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,169
and where it allocates that sector your

175
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,210
file only uses some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that space so in</font>

176
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,180
this case our data takes up one two

177
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,849
three four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> six seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sectors right</font>

178
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,410
almost seven sectors and what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

179
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,539
slack space or in this case there's a

180
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,580
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> called soccer is we take this</font>

181
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,110
slack space and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

182
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,389
stuff that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to hide we</font>

183
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,680
insert it into the Sox base and then we

184
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:22,270
use our slacker program where you can

185
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,789
pull it back out of the slack space

186
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,529
where we're actually ready to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

187
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">another</font>

188
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,039
hide it and this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even</font>

189
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:31,049
more advanced things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your law</font>

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforcement whatnot sometimes they like</font>

191
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:36,209
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able find this kind of</font>

192
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:38,638
thing very similarly you can actually

193
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:40,799
tagged blocks are under hard drive as

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">Babcock's the lesson here is the</font>

195
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,818
disparate use it it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> overwrite the</font>

196
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,829
data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bad blocks I so by</font>

197
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,539
tagging as bad blocks you now have a

198
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,789
secret partition that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

199
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,998
never touch so if you all hide files in

200
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:57,229
a in a sector labeled bad block right

201
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:59,549
nobody will ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the stuff in her</font>

202
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:05,399
anybody else have any other bad point

203
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:08,248
hiding ideas so let's talk about stuff

204
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,959
that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at a conference of the</font>

205
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,459
miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> da for several conference I was</font>

206
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,249
presented out there and there was this

207
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:16,349
guy and he his name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hawk he's this</font>

208
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,449
big-time investigator<font color="#CCCCCC"> right likes to do</font>

209
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,299
forensics knows all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff and</font>

210
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,129
where he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of struck me it was</font>

211
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:25,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presence of encryption provides</font>

212
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:28,169
reasonable suspicion so does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

213
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">me encryption is historically the thing</font>

214
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:31,979
that we rely on as security

215
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,318
professionals to protect us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect o</font>

216
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,750
data right we encrypt our files that way

217
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:39,058
nobody sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well if you have files</font>

218
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,889
that are encrypted and send law

219
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:42,929
enforcement agency comes along and sees

220
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have encryption they have</font>

221
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,319
reasonable suspicion they know that

222
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,420
there's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

223
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:49,469
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect so as security</font>

224
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,360
professionals if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

225
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,829
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that thing encrypting it just</font>

226
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,389
says hey I have something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font>

227
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,979
right and that's between you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

228
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">courts as to whether they force you to</font>

229
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:03,750
enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> your password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and decrypt it which</font>

230
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:06,480
brings us to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the FBI the CIA</font>

231
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,490
the law enforcement agencies they know

232
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,259
about this right and maybe even said

233
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,910
that that having encryption is huge they

234
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,009
like encryption they won't be able to

235
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">use encryption for themselves but when</font>

236
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,670
it comes to you guys using encryption

237
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,649
they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because then</font>

238
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:29,089
they're not able to see what you're

239
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:31,720
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so here's a here's a quote</font>

240
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,519
this is actually really interesting

241
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,829
well familiar there's a case right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

242
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,629
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is taking it on there's this</font>

243
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,810
lady that was involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mortgage scam</font>

244
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:44,050
and her laptop is encrypted with our

245
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,779
true captors in like that well the State

246
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,279
Department of Justice<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot</font>

247
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,750
prosecutor without decrypting the laptop

248
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,720
so they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set precedents and</font>

249
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that for so to decrypt a laptop so they</font>

250
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,620
can prosecutor so if this case actually

251
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,060
does go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a late they first sort</font>

252
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,500
of decrypt it could set precedents for

253
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,599
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> there as encryption is using</font>

254
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,000
that and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said before just the</font>

255
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,649
presence of encryption know if you have

256
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">truecrypt on any other encryption</font>

257
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:11,230
algorithm is cause for reasonable

258
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,459
suspicion and as you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> department</font>

259
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,160
is actually saying that you know it

260
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,628
impedes their their ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect</font>

261
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,459
evidence and prosecute this lady

262
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,459
basically so question

263
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,650
so the comment well is if you are first

264
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,540
equipped your encryption in its<font color="#E5E5E5"> self</font>

265
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">incrimination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess um you know the</font>

266
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifth right right and that's like i said</font>

267
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,739
is in in case right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and eff is</font>

268
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,750
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so i think it's pretty</font>

269
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,030
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we as security</font>

270
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,740
professionals stay abreast on these

271
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,740
cases in yes good<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

272
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,850
well that to a certain extent yeah

273
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:10,559
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure that might be here you</font>

274
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:12,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">wanna comment on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah so you're</font>

275
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,689
absolutely right right the idea here is

276
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,539
when it comes to a court case right

277
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:21,149
somebody trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say you did something</font>

278
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,669
naughty what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is the fact</font>

279
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:25,859
that you were even encrypted data says

280
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:27,689
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to hide now it</font>

281
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:29,639
comes down to your hip or things like

282
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:32,009
that where you're required to hide the

283
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,529
data you may have a point if you're

284
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:36,239
hiding if your encrypted data because

285
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,189
you're legally compelled to encrypt the

286
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:39,989
data you know with pci or HIPAA or

287
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,759
something like that then it might make

288
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:43,799
sense really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're talking about</font>

289
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,259
it in this particular case is we have a

290
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,269
woman who really should not have been

291
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,669
encrypting data by their standards right

292
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:52,289
she obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> had something to hide she</font>

293
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:56,369
was already part of this other crime

294
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:58,619
this mortgage scam and so they they felt

295
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:00,389
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to obtain the evidence</font>

296
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:02,089
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> convict her they</font>

297
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:04,469
made to unencrypt her thing and so they

298
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,039
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to force her to enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a password</font>

299
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:09,179
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this in like Orlando said eff is</font>

300
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,218
adamantly fighting against this for

301
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,409
exactly the reasons DD brought up you

302
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:15,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">have Fifth Amendment and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot the</font>

303
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,639
problem is if the encryption is there

304
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:19,409
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking out they know you</font>

305
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,149
have something hot right so the

306
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,009
remainder of this talk is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

307
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:24,479
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that the</font>

308
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:27,689
encryption is there but they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

309
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:31,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the encryption is there cool all</font>

310
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so I found this cartoon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

311
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:36,539
this really is really telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

312
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:38,699
well they're basically saying is as a

313
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,679
quick download you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff in</font>

314
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:43,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same man I got this super awesome</font>

315
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,478
laptop i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> truecrypt on all my stuff</font>

316
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,889
is super awesomely encrypted nobody's

317
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:49,289
ever getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of this data right</font>

318
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,699
and the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is somebody really come</font>

319
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to him drugged them hit them with a</font>

320
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,939
five-dollar winch and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

321
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:55,348
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us the password right they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

322
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">to torture you there they'll force you</font>

323
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:58,589
the laws being come after you we're

324
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:00,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to make it a living hell until you</font>

325
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:01,679
enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> that password and so we do see</font>

326
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,300
some things coming out with like

327
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">truecrypt and they actually</font>

328
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,290
our multiple volume so you have like the

329
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,630
fake password that gets them out the

330
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,769
stuff that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to tell them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

331
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,240
you're protecting that's not really

332
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:14,910
illegal and then you have the real

333
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,350
password as the other stuff right so we

334
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,390
start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and this is</font>

335
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,310
the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why right you don't want</font>

336
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,019
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compel you to enter the</font>

337
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,170
password to make your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life horrible</font>

338
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:29,250
until you do that anybody know is hiding

339
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,750
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture yeah so I found this</font>

340
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,480
picture on the web it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

341
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool this person had actually hit</font>

342
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,790
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graphic within this graphic</font>

343
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,279
this text with a list this graphic right

344
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,790
here and this is steganography right

345
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,189
there and that's kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orlando</font>

346
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,410
base this on steganography is awesome

347
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,600
right steganography is you really hide

348
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,329
something within an image or within a

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,339
movie or within something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else very very</font>

350
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,500
cool technique and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got to thinking</font>

351
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,390
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you could do steganography and</font>

352
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,649
encryption at the same time that's a

353
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,390
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful combination that same</font>

354
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,329
guy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about before lands</font>

355
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,339
hawk he also said this the cases I've

356
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:15,390
lost I've been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to text a geography</font>

357
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:17,279
but not break<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so this guy is a very</font>

358
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,589
seasoned investigator this guy who's

359
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,800
looking for child porn cases and things

360
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,839
like that he says that he goes he does

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,760
an investigation he finds steganography

362
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,980
he's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file isn't</font>

363
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite what the file is but he's never</font>

364
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,730
able breathless data and especially if

365
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,890
the file is encrypted he's not able to

366
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that which says to me hey this is</font>

367
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,740
some good stuff as a security

368
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional if I'm trying to really</font>

369
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,709
hide this from somebody else this is

370
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be paying</font>

371
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:48,329
attention to so the problem is terror

372
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,620
organizations Osama bin Laden I they

373
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,000
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this too right they've</font>

374
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,860
actually been using this for years and

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">years encroaching test a geography</font>

376
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,140
equals awesome this right you can play

377
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">me on that basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can take a</font>

378
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,850
file if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can encrypt it and then</font>

379
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,160
stagger it throw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the web</font>

380
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,870
somewhere you can exchange messages back

381
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,040
and forth confidentiality and that's

382
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,600
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys have done</font>

383
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,969
they've been using chat boards and

384
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,589
things like that are purely files

385
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:21,990
exchanging messages nobody's the wiser

386
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:23,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you so I'm</font>

387
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,839
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project we didn't believe any</font>

388
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,518
background research so I'm after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

389
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,019
coded everything and start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

390
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that there is some other</font>

391
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,740
projects out there that time to take

392
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,750
this concept this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is by no means a pink</font>

393
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,279
complete list that there are some clear

394
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,269
applications projects that are being

395
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">done right out we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to give</font>

396
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:41,040
attribution to those as well next slide

397
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:43,378
so a new concept for data protection

398
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,810
exfiltration<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where our project</font>

399
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,540
comes in its stay go so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

400
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,869
up online a<font color="#E5E5E5"> WWI at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stake with the zero</font>

401
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">com so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> st g g or what are you gotta stay</font>

402
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:57,449
calm right and so what r2 does data

403
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,750
exfiltration protection it's a web-based

404
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:03,628
https upload so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 53 standard</font>

405
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,970
port the data that it gets uploaded is

406
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:08,639
broken into<font color="#CCCCCC"> dave chunks and each of</font>

407
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,980
those data chunks is encrypted private a

408
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,899
nice day go and then the encrypted data

409
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,370
chunk gets staggered into images they

410
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,559
get scraped<font color="#E5E5E5"> off line and then those</font>

411
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,480
stated images are placed out in the

412
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,309
clouds so no data is actually stored on

413
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,069
the server the Soviet were using is

414
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:25,259
mainly an algorithm to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform this</font>

415
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:27,479
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the benefits of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

416
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,100
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course the data</font>

417
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,579
exfiltration to<font color="#E5E5E5"> animate system via a</font>

418
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard port 443 lady most no intrusion</font>

419
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,550
protection systems things like that

420
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,579
aren't going to block that for

421
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">expectation the encrypted contents to</font>

422
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,719
prevent others from accessing data like

423
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,639
I said the entire data trunks are

424
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,990
encrypted using all your choice of AES

425
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,540
when we ate or 256 and their stated

426
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,129
contents or stay complacent images to

427
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,980
prevent others from finding the data and

428
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:58,329
lastly there put on the cloud so that

429
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,350
provides a some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of reasonable</font>

430
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,670
plausible deniability because you don't

432
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,109
it's stored out the cloud and myself

433
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,299
there's nothing so locally so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fads</font>

434
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,010
password my ability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture</font>

435
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,079
ever tool so our main<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

436
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing requires the CIA triangle we</font>

437
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,369
want to have confidentiality integrity

438
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:19,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and availability of your point or in</font>

439
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,349
this case your data right and so this

440
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,480
what I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you can upload</font>

441
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">any type of binary file it could be a</font>

442
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,949
you know a video it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a zip file</font>

443
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,780
you can do encryption and compression

444
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:31,250
prior to uploading it so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

445
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,559
trust our<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption or anything that</font>

446
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could be routing algorithm encrypt</font>

447
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,090
it upload it and that fire would get

448
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,340
broken up into data chunks and then each

449
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,730
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these data chunks are we create a</font>

450
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,678
hash too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess for more of the data</font>

451
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,450
integrity to validate when we retrieve

452
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,010
that that there hasn't been altered in

453
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,500
any way so recruit a hash of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

454
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,879
chunks and the entire data file so when

455
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,530
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put Humpty back together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

456
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,059
those chunks<font color="#CCCCCC"> came together we could</font>

457
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,360
verify that yes this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file that</font>

458
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,370
got uploaded in nothing's changed and

459
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,959
this is a small piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the algorithm</font>

460
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,580
that just does some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chunking so</font>

461
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,399
if you're doing encryption it actually

462
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">adds a little bit of padding to the file</font>

463
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:12,799
size so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't just arbitrary value</font>

464
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,110
we I guess minimize the size of those

465
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,429
chunks so it doesn't you know add too

466
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,408
much data into the statehood image

467
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:22,130
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will start messing up the</font>

468
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:24,289
resolution of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> image and then here as</font>

469
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,080
part of the checking of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunk so we</font>

470
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,030
have the hash before and the hash after

471
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,070
and we could simply compare those and

472
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,620
say yes this data is valid it hasn't

473
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">been messed with this is part of the</font>

474
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,489
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually checking the chunks so</font>

475
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,750
when you retrieve it I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

476
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,030
simple straightforward you have your

477
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,539
hash before your hash after check it no

478
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:46,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem the encryption every piece of</font>

479
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,850
data is encrypted if you don't we use

480
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">AES encryption we use a simple PHP</font>

481
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,689
encryption to encrypt and decrypt that

482
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,570
you have the option<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using a years 120</font>

483
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">or 256 encryption and like I said that's</font>

484
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide data confidentiality and</font>

485
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,470
here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

486
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,400
the encryption you know pretty

487
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,840
straightforward nothing too complicated

488
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,950
again decrypting it kind of just the

489
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,959
reverse of the algorithm that thing's

490
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,540
crazy depending on which I what kind of

491
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
about written using to decrypt it and

492
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,440
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> steganography so when we're</font>

493
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the actual steganography part</font>

494
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,290
and there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different techniques</font>

495
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,320
that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for steganography</font>

496
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,090
some are much better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> others you</font>

497
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,560
could store data in the comment period

498
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the image which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really lame and</font>

499
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,720
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really steganography you</font>

500
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,880
could use the unused<font color="#E5E5E5"> color space so if</font>

501
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,920
you have a 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> cullen most time no</font>

502
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,290
use 24-bit you could use those on these

503
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,240
bits are you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alpha channel for</font>

504
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,710
transparency no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm usually there's</font>

505
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,830
about seven bits of data there that you

506
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,180
use per pixel within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alpha Channel</font>

507
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,129
this technique is actually really cool

508
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to pixel value differences</font>

509
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,540
now what it basically does is you have

510
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,490
within the partner color you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

511
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,080
pixels and it will take two pixels and

512
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,540
they'll have an algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

513
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,370
determines between those two pixels if

514
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,980
it's even or odd and that's a symbolic

515
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,270
representation of your binary data so

516
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,310
it's a proprietary algorithm will take

517
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,410
two pixels and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok these two pixels</font>

518
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,850
this is an odd or this is even and with

519
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,280
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could symbolically represent</font>

520
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,439
binary data without it actually being in

521
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,450
the image so we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

522
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,900
technique and looks like you're sure

523
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we do is actually use the primary</font>

524
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,570
colors and each primary color you have

525
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,850
about them I just three bits which could

526
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,570
use for each pixels so if you have red

527
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,719
green blue representing you know by 255

528
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,550
255 255 whatever so if it's even let's

529
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,140
say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 if it's odd it's one you know</font>

530
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,120
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a symbolic representation of that</font>

531
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">data so the data is not actually stored</font>

532
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,199
within the image it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> symbolically</font>

533
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,510
represented by the pixels so that makes

534
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense inventive questions on that so ok</font>

535
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,100
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide they vanish this method like</font>

536
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,840
I said is that the date is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually</font>

537
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,750
stored there it's just symbolically

538
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,629
represented within the pics will baby so

539
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,000
there's no actually

540
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,040
annoying the image is actually stay gold

541
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,620
or that's the way the image was

542
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,580
originally because there's no actual

543
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,139
changing of the binary<font color="#CCCCCC"> data it's just</font>

544
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,720
taking the symbolic binary data and

545
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,170
representing it and we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

546
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,660
about 135 kilobytes from 800 x 600 pixel

547
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,360
image with compression so the Stingo

548
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:20,690
algorithm it's pretty simple we scrape

549
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,070
course images offline we put them and

550
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">see where we're doing here yeah we put</font>

551
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,939
them in this function<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I created</font>

552
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">stay put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it takes your data file your</font>

553
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,560
image your key and then puts<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in a</font>

554
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">state good file you can look at this</font>

555
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,179
life later or diste going again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

556
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple function it takes the URL</font>

557
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,710
that's encrypted decrypted takes the key

558
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,500
and then takes a bath and retrieve your

559
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,790
image so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're gonna do a little demo of</font>

560
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,280
this application so y'all could get a

561
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:51,470
idea of what it's actually doing and

562
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:55,070
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it yeah that was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

563
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,230
concern so I'm scraping off IMDb I'm not

564
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure about violating end-user license</font>

565
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,960
agreements whatever they're publicly

566
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,110
available images so I'm scraping them

567
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,960
off line and then placing them up on any

568
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,540
check so I don't know legal

569
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,940
ramifications that's you know I don't

570
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,940
know what's up yeah

571
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,309
why not

572
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,750
oh just pop I'm not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I'm</font>

573
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,129
violating the VW I'm just taking images

574
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have publicly available online</font>

575
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,830
well i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to sell it well</font>

576
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,740
maybe yeah you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

577
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,809
right we need a large repository that

578
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,540
had a lot of images in high definition

579
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:38,928
and this so this tool isn't really a

580
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:44,030
public to pursue this this is

581
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:45,350
educational purposes yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that is</font>

582
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,360
one of the improvements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been</font>

583
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:49,189
looking at and we'll talk about this a

584
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,500
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually have a section on</font>

585
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,860
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation if you're</font>

586
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely right IMDb was kind of our</font>

587
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,399
full shot of this and we just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

588
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:01,490
we want stuff that we could pull down

589
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,010
and then the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of with Orlando had</font>

590
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,960
shown before the size of the image the

591
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,330
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pixels determines how much</font>

592
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,980
data we can store within that and so

593
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,350
these images are you pull off IMDb

594
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,820
they're pretty large images and you're

595
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,639
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we found is especially</font>

596
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,320
with high-definition movies the files

597
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,270
are very big which means we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can store</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

598
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,490
lot of space in there okay so here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

599
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,309
example you can see us<font color="#CCCCCC"> Margot into</font>

601
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:36,950
see if I can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bigger yeah yeah so</font>

getting used to scrape that random day

609
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,080
we talked about you can provide a key to

612
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,220
I chose aes-128 and there's a flag for

613
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,870
the base or along the base output will

614
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,659
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> mayor a sec we give it the</font>

619
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:20,580
does is it grabs a 40 images at home so

620
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:23,129
that you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep going back to</font>

621
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,009
grab more so it grabs a whole bunch of

622
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:29,879
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we go we stay gold in there we</font>

623
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:33,090
ates encrypted it we checked it out we

624
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:34,498
invalidate the image and there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so</font>

625
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,840
that image was actually up there to

626
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:38,580
imageshack when i did this of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

627
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,249
gonna go and show you there's the end of

maybe how the a virulent probably not

631
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:50,999
right you can't tell them it so now

632
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,309
we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> East iWeb to</font>

633
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,019

00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:07,889
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a password and very quickly</font>

640
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:13,399
and click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your project file open with</font>

645
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:35,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apocalypto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in this example we're</font>

646
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,899
going to take an unencrypted image<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

647
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:40,799
just a loner image file we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

648
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:46,570
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run the snuggle on this guy</font>

649
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:49,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">eclipse bigger so very similar we</font>

650
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:50,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically give it a name Tiger Team we</font>

651
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,980
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a movie Taylor let's get</font>

652
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:56,259
cooties provide the key this one's no

653
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,419
encryption the bigger the file I

654
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:02,799
encryption will obviously make it bigger

655
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:05,970
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say no encryption they'll run</font>

656
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,408
faster and choose less images with this

657
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,149
output in this case we selected the

658
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,279
image we go ahead and hit some mint I've

659
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:14,918
cut the timed out on this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

660
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,889
they also take a very long time not very

661
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,440
long couple minutes or so so now it's

662
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:22,870
going out grabbing a whole bunch of

663
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,700
villages and you can see it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

664
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">do multiple images this time because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

665
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,750
have a larger file it's an image file so

666
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:36,220
it's getting go down now the multiple

667
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:38,980
images input already image into those we

668
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:44,409
have some time lapse videography here

669
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:46,330
Bam Bam scroll all the way down you can

670
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">see all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the images sometimes it grabs an</font>

671
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,070
image that smelly<font color="#E5E5E5"> belly sore ditches at</font>

672
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,240
other times you're different images out

673
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:57,279
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> already filed and then up</font>

674
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,490
getting sharked into multiple images in

675
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:04,870
this case there's 20 was that 2008

692
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,669
your question you're absolutely right

693
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,949
right we in this particular demo one may

694
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,660
using one image repository so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

695
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,580
image repository say all the sudden

696
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,260
decides had a watermark and every single

697
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,419
airlines images BAM our day is gone

698
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,660

699
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,220
yes we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and this is</font>

700
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,350
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a future improvement to stay</font>

701
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">well if we choose to go that route is we</font>

702
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,669
can actually go we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

703
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:43,250
image repositories and then use it just

704
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,800
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right you can say i can upload</font>

705
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,350
multiple pieces coming to Mecca a raid 0

706
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,200
type of thing so you have uploaded to

707
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,689
one image repository upload to another

708
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,520
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to another and now if I go this</font>

709
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,900
one and the pieces in there that's

710
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gave this other one</font>

711
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:02,170
that you have multiple locations um we

712
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,639
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that stuff in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sec here</font>

713
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,910
so it full disclosures and Cavett's

714
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,290
you'd be able to some of these file

715
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,200
types<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests still work so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

716
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:15,139
tested everything Michael Elena said all

717
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,570
binary data should work we've tested

718
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,429
text files if smiddy's different types

719
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,250
of images all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work without a</font>

720
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,750
problem so in theory pretty much

721
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:29,570
anything that you throw it should be

722
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:31,730
able to function is 256 encryption I so

723
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,010
we have some issues verifying the

724
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,809
integrity of the data trunk and so the

725
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,300
program stops processing was unable to

726
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:39,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">verify the integrity this doesn't always</font>

727
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:44,178
happen it only happens in some

728
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:50,059
circumstances so we're concerned that

729
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:51,380
experimental images so like you said the

730
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,780
images come from the public image

731
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,610
repository and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of issues</font>

732
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,540
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come from that right of legal</font>

733
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,429
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside if I have a</font>

734
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,649
auditorium villages and I can go back

735
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and identify that original image I can</font>

736
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,490
make a comparison between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

737
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">image and the image that I've stay out</font>

738
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:10,630
and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have that diff and so this is</font>

739
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually code that found on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

740
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,470
where it actually shows here's the

741
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,719
original and here's the modified one and

742
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,970
it actually does this diff using

743
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,650
basically an algorithm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Orlando have</font>

744
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:26,230
used with the story a bit per pixel in

745
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:31,300
the RGB value and it actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

746
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,860
diff and then outputs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diff yeah one</font>

747
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,120
comment under so I'm sorry try to do

748
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to see if I could like break my own</font>

749
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,959
application and when you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the of the</font>

750
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,460
original image and you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

751
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,440
one it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't give you the usable data</font>

752
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,850
because i did is encrypted so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

753
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">end up getting is it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big blob of</font>

754
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:47,320
like black you know just animated black

755
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,970
on it and uh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tried different</font>

756
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,189
images and different stuff and if you

757
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,900
really getting a usable data that it is

758
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,020
encrypted and just a chunk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data</font>

759
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,640
and one caveat circumvent this opening

760
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,440
is if we just were to take the original

761
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,360
images which we scrape and added a

762
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,370
random digital watermark so it wasn't

763
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,870
like the original there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> no way of</font>

764
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,340
finding the original image to compare it

765
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:11,350
to so that's kind of you know mute point

766
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,419
any motion this earlier but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you</font>

767
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,040
won't be able to fit the most size<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

768
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,200
that that particular image problem that

769
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,420
we're doing so high definitely high def

770
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,670
images like what you find with pixar

771
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,260
disney etc we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out the best images</font>

772
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use because you can fit the most data</font>

773
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,800
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i only equipped the data the</font>

774
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,320
update is encrypted right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's https the</font>

775
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,149
trunks are encrypted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the file exists</font>

776
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,129
on the server unencrypted for very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font>

777
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">period of time right you hit browse you</font>

778
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,870
select the file<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font>

779
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:44,679
into some sort of temporary space

780
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:46,330
theoretically if someone were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

781
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,120
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server whether it's by</font>

782
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,309
subpoena or whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that temp space</font>

783
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,899
were washed out they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

784
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,059
the file system actually look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

785
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:58,539
data there might be data there for them

786
00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:02,110
to find we've never tested that but in

787
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:04,480
theory you should be able to do that ssl

788
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,789
so our application only uses a<font color="#CCCCCC"> snake-oil</font>

789
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,159
search and you know we could probably

790
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,080
prepare a whole presentation on why that

791
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucks and why you can man the middle</font>

792
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:17,470
that to be one of that if you want to

793
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:19,269
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it captures whoever capture it</font>

794
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,120
works fantastic and firefox if you're

795
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:23,740
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it it works in IE there's</font>

796
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,258
some new options that you have to step

797
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the dialog box if you're playing</font>

798
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:32,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a I'd suggest Firefox file update</font>

799
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">size so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually limited the file</font>

800
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,070
upload size I'm whisper typical

801
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:42,369
application to 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2400 bites if you</font>

802
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:46,080
need to do more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that why'd it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

803
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:52,168
the application you can do it yeah

804
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:56,949
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our choice yeah that would be bad</font>

805
00:32:52,169 --> 00:33:00,340
Cashin so page and image cache is very

806
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,110
popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> these days to speed up website</font>

807
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,449
performance right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see all sorts of</font>

808
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,809
companies out there like Akamai and your

809
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,249
squid proxies and things like that so

810
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:10,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">theoretically stagger pages or images</font>

811
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:13,299
could be cached locally or on these

812
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:15,418
proxy servers which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

813
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,950
copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just viewed</font>

814
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,539
available on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> system so you no</font>

815
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,779
longer have that plausible deniability

816
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:24,850
right law enforcement could subpoena the

817
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:27,039
results of that proxy find it on the

818
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,350
proxy server we're screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also</font>

819
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,940
locally a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times browsers will</font>

820
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,918
cash images for a certain period of time

821
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,149
so if you want possible deniability

822
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,340
clearly caches don't use proxies yeah um

823
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,629
so there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned them</font>

824
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the demo there's</font>

825
00:33:40,629 --> 00:33:44,918
the most memorable flag this is the

826
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,529
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

827
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,389
bass output is going to outputs on the

828
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,730
copies of the images the Royal thumbnail

829
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:53,709
similar if you don't use for both it's

830
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,360
not going to do that the reason why

831
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,760
do that is because if you have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

832
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,010
verbose then caches can catch those

833
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,580
images if you don't all it is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

834
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,919
output in that shrimp get cash all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

835
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,899
like we said there's really improvement

836
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,820
in this tool absolutely there's no doubt

837
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:12,129
about that this was kind of a side

838
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,589
project for both Orlando and I and we

839
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:15,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about this stegal mirroring so</font>

840
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:18,040
this was kind of an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we came up</font>

841
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,619
with how would you do replication how

842
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,779
did you handle the scenario where a

843
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,210
image repository when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we marked</font>

844
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,580
everything and wiped your data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we</font>

845
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:30,550
came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sega mirroring murmuring</font>

846
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,259
was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arista a repository like 11 1</font>

847
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,089
million would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> staggering matures in</font>

848
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,810
two different repositories and you can

849
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:40,149
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to your nearly plus you know</font>

850
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,879
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> number you want right I can</font>

851
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:46,330
have 10 minute repositories for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 XR</font>

852
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,949
redundancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yo we haven't I in from</font>

853
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,679
them to that but if you were going right

854
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:53,348
this application very easy to do you can

855
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,619
definitely implement that are bigger

856
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:58,810
files so the bigger files you have the

857
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:00,760
more data you able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale right with</font>

858
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,670
an image<font color="#E5E5E5"> we label store certain amount</font>

859
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,920
of data now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go up to an mp3 that's</font>

860
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 Meg file right you can store more</font>

861
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,400
stuff in that if you go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like an</font>

862
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,859
MPEG file or something like that that

863
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,720
can be hundreds of medics right so we

864
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,980
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this idea you can use</font>

865
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,890
something like SoundCloud as a

866
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,599
repository or mp3s out there or YouTube

867
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,279
as a repository through a movie files

868
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,619
out there your grant if they do a

869
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,230
manipulation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data you're kind of</font>

870
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoes but if it maintains the integrity</font>

871
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,770
of that data if it doesn't do weird

872
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:33,250
compression and things like that then

873
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:35,560
you should be able to do that um<font color="#CCCCCC"> sue</font>

874
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,230
cash kills I we should probably add a no

875
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,000
cash<font color="#CCCCCC"> in HTTP expires headers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of</font>

876
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,250
talked about that a little proxy stuff

877
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,430
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simple page tags that</font>

878
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:48,490
weaker bad that we've told proxies not

879
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:51,339
to cashless all right back to the future

880
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,140
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some digging on this</font>

881
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:55,750
and it turns out that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have</font>

882
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,450
had very similar ideas to this it hasn't

883
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">been implemented quantum assembly</font>

884
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,279
that we did but<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

885
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,589
described an entire file system that is

886
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,930
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> state monographie it is</font>

887
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:08,700
complete with how do you do I nodes and

888
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,098
how do you do different directories and

889
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:14,368
all sorts of stuff and this wasn't from

890
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,990
too long ago 2007 but this is a convert

891
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,020
file system layout in bed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

892
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,549
flickr photos and this is the local view

893
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,200
of when the file system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually met</font>

894
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,730
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something other people have</font>

895
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,529
actually put two pretty cool use and

896
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,079
seeing this and this project actually

897
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,720
turned into this project which is pics

898
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,700
SF which is the privacy enhanced image

899
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,160
based cooperative file system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

900
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">slightly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mirror and so they've actually</font>

901
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,140
taken this and they do automatic image

902
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:42,180
selection from video they use a tour

903
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,089
name to actually route traffic through

904
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,549
different nodes to protect the users and

905
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:49,500
then they'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this covered FS on top</font>

906
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,210
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> few so it still uses the flickr stuff</font>

907
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:55,890
and now what's it all through these

908
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:57,540
toilets so you have you know 11 proxy

909
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,400
when point on the network doesn't get

910
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:15,869
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information and then back here</font>

911
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:17,310
you actually entire file system where

912
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,920
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are their application detection</font>

913
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,990
software

914
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,670
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the case with all the</font>

915
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,529
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll and I talked about before with</font>

916
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stager</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus encryption these are all</font>

917
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,549
things they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

918
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,049
operating system have<font color="#E5E5E5"> under system and</font>

919
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:32,089
then we give back to the conundrum that

920
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,680
we had with encryption which is if it

921
00:37:32,089 --> 00:37:35,480
exists on your system then you're

922
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,220
probably using that for something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

923
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something and now people are</font>

924
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,910
going to start digging<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so we want</font>

925
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away from that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steiger</font>

926
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,920
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system it</font>

927
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,700
uses HTTP call outs there's nearly

928
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,099
nothing there for somebody to find all

929
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,049
right so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> closing this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is proof of</font>

930
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:56,200
concept this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> production application</font>

931
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:58,190
you can try it Orlando gave you the URL

932
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,129
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for educational purposes</font>

933
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:04,069
only right we're not responsible if you

934
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,410
use or misuse this tool right I don't

935
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:07,849
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what data you put up the way</font>

936
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,290
eventually it's getting turned into an

937
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:11,270
image and put in somebody else's server

938
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,430
we're not collecting alien contents

939
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:15,910
we're not keeping any contents but you

940
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:18,410
can play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right it's educational</font>

941
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,118
all comments and opinions are the

942
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,490
property of the individuals the two

943
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,069
arrests again their weapons are

944
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,049
employers or anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font>

content is provided as is no warranties

946
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:31,790
assurances or guarantees right yeah we

947
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:32,990
were pretty hard on this I are

948
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,390
attractive for application

949
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,790
vulnerabilities are more Lando did a lot

950
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,529
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of coding on it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

951
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:44,259
issues there's bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's bound</font>

952
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:44,260
to be something so use at your own risk

953
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,669
I just want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about where I see</font>

954
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,960
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going and what I want to do</font>

955
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,819
this project it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a</font>

956
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">web-based application but what I wanted</font>

957
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:57,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do with this is use it for the</font>

958
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,510
exfiltration and I guess circumventing

959
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDs intrusion protection system so i</font>

960
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,500
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to see if I could make an</font>

961
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:05,569
API and make a Metasploit module where I

962
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,910
could use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get my data from the</font>

963
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:10,069
cloud on a victim machine you know

964
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting binaries executable whatever do</font>

965
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,119
a standard port and XP<font color="#E5E5E5"> no circumventing</font>

966
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:15,380
all the intrusion protection systems

967
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,319
that might be on the system so i think

968
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,569
that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

969
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">this stale encryption technique is you</font>

970
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:23,900
know maybe a Metasploit module or

971
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:26,750
something like that to use this so

972
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:34,550
that's interesting yeah questions

973
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:38,010
I haven't tested

974
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:39,540
no I I had some the last conference was

975
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,910
that some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did take nog raphy</font>

976
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,279
research and they were telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that</font>

977
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this technique wouldn't be a I guess</font>

978
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,180
recognized by any case and other tools

979
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,130
like that but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

980
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">software wouldn't pick up on this</font>

981
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:55,350
technique symbolic representation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

982
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,760
data I'm not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as my but the</font>

983
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,380
technique that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it a symbolic</font>

984
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,140
representation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of binary data there's no</font>

985
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,550
actual data there to compare against oh

986
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:12,620
so anything would just look like an

987
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:15,000
image right color value so you know

988
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">unless if they have the original image</font>

989
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,350
to compare it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no tell just</font>

990
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:24,419
based on the RGB value that there's data

991
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:27,380
in there that makes sense yeah other

992
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,380
questions this

993
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:48,010
yes

994
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:50,770
yes you're absolutely right they again

995
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,320
an educational<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof-of-concept pride so</font>

996
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:56,470
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this as go ahead</font>

997
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,480
and upload your prom to this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

998
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,919
look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as this is a really cool</font>

999
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,020
thing something that we were play with

1000
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,180
and it works very very well but

1001
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,970
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are lots and lots of</font>

1002
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,680
