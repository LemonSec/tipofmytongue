about social engineering and what is it

111
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,670
you find a little bit what it is so I

112
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,990
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we understand it</font>

113
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,670
when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the technical part</font>

114
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,370
we're not really talking about true

115
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,689
social engineering okay what we're kind

116
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,210
of pushing the definition there but

117
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,830
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get without a minute so</font>

118
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:40,350
that's why it's it's actually obtaining

119
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:43,230
access information through deceptive

120
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,670
means all this is deceptive I mean when

121
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,410
you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your wife you compliment her</font>

122
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ask your girl on a date that's</font>

123
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,160
social engineering in a way right you're

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,490
selling yourself you're trying to you

125
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,560
know remove your into a position where

126
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,930
you look better to that person not

127
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,969
always deceptive but in this case we're

128
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,520
talking about attackers and targeted

129
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,200
attacks so we're playing the part of the

130
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,329

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,990
i'm going to call this from classical

173
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:05,079
that's a classic movie about about con

174
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,460
artists now technical social generic is

175
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,310
not in a personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing actually</font>

176
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,490
with attacks I guess the person and when

177
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,050
we're working

178
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,250
behavior as a person we're looking it's

179
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,290
human behavior here but we're not

180
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,110
actually interacting them with I'm going

181
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,849
to come a level<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

182
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,279
here like fishing and you know the

183
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,810
latest scams websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thing</font>

184
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,540
wireless network smooth then USB device

185
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,390
attacks or client-side attacks requiring

186
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,490
usually some kind of user interaction

187
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,580
right we want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to click the link</font>

188
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:38,450
open the attachment plug that USB device

189
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:43,930
into their system that's my current

190
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:48,440
system by the way so some advantages of

191
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:51,949
this type of attack yes you look a large

192
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,360
volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> of victims right and we're</font>

193
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,920
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about targeted rather than just</font>

194
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,110
simply spamming everyone on the planet

195
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,810
because that's not where target attack

196
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> people wanting you to buy their</font>

Rogaine or maybe become part of the

206
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:27,770
he sent out three point three million

207
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:31,940
emails right 11,000 bank accounts were

208
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:35,149
compromised now good point three percent

209
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,070
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> on most of our success meters that's</font>

210
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:40,670
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very good but think about</font>

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> remenham how much effort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did it</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take that they can we do</font>

but we will effort he compromised 11,000

216
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,959
bank accounts so you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really</font>

217
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:59,180
high way to return on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tag</font>

218
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:04,040
to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful the primary goal</font>

219
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is get them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to click or open or insert</font>

220
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,870
the drive or whatever

221
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,760
some technical challenges we have a seat

222
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,790
with the subway attack they can be

223
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,170
complex and time-consuming I'm i can

224
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,149
remember as a pen tester i was asked to

225
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,399
do a news conf testing I actually kind

226
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:26,100
of regret it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I dreaded it right you may</font>

227
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in for you have your</font>

228
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,010
potential for heavy anybody jesters hell

229
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">you even asked to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see attacks</font>

230
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,160
anybody your first one is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

231
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,930
okay then how to pull this off<font color="#E5E5E5"> will I</font>

232
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,370
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that Chris I got through the</font>

233
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,949
website I've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff I</font>

234
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,390
gotta email and you're actually you're

235
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,540
actually living at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point from being</font>

236
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:47,069
this geeky guy behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer who</font>

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,290
sues launching like you know a metal

238
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,790
attacks against against Dina systems to

239
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,579
that person that's actually send

240
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,410
something to somebody right yet actually

241
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,790
in some way to reach out to a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,550
figure out how to do it what's effective

243
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,319
and that's that's part of the problem if

244
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,359
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta prepare</font>

245
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,569
the mechanisms the exploits phishing

246
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,640
emails and<font color="#E5E5E5"> science be believable right</font>

247
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:12,869
they've got to pass by antivirus

248
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,770
controls if you spend all day forming an

249
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,000
email with a really good at payload it's

250
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,119
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go for it if it gets past</font>

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,189
the antivirus right so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

252
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,928
these are challenges and by the way I

253
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:33,800
have some demos and just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit if</font>

254
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:36,210
they'll work wyd demos right big<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no</font>

255
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something to this hog my computer</font>

256
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,929
crashed because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had so much resources</font>

257
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,120
allocated my virtual machines<font color="#CCCCCC"> I freaked</font>

258
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this machine and it crashed</font>

259
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,169
and while we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting am asking for</font>

260
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,809
questions mrs. a word and then five

261
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I say okay let's get</font>

262
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,160
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the question I was like no so</font>

263
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,760
if it crashes that's when you ask

264
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,970
questions not right after not predicting

265
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,650
you can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> now your honor so here's a</font>

266
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,320
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge right so we've got a</font>

267
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,840
company

268
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,549
wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how effective we are at</font>

269
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,360
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these kind of types of</font>

270
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:12,789
attacks phishing attacks how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

271
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,850
measure this because we can't even

272
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:17,110
measure the technical stuff very well we

273
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,029
can't measure very well how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with</font>

274
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,779
antivirus software on that company how

275
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:26,440
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure based on human behavior</font>

276
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:28,480
how y'all your people do well I think

277
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,320
the best way is to do this frequently

278
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,700
and and it's simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> just click your data</font>

279
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,090
together and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's any trends</font>

280
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:42,399
but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were talking about human</font>

281
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:43,629
behavior here the likelihood of taking a

282
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,360
leak it really depends a lot of things

283
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the morning I clicked on that link right</font>

284
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe I didn't get that later in the day</font>

285
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:52,330
when I was more rested maybe who had

286

288
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:02,019

people less likely click<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link</font>

290
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:06,639
because of the mood the grumpy we'll all

291
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:09,789
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to click it more or less time</font>

of day you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know our this is a good our</font>

293
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,169
nuclear is more likely click fake scoop

294
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,289
with links then sees employees I think

298
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:25,779
anything comes from corporately and they

299
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:30,399
get trouble foot wide effort something

300
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:32,230
important which bait works in other

301
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:34,029
words what type of what are you using

302
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,679
the pool of men right is it some fake

303
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:38,259
product which you would not use probably

304
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,070
for targeted attacks or is it like an

305
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,480
email to say

306
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,639

it soon with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tribe and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way if</font>

310
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:52,360
you're gazing on percentage-wise let's

311
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,168
say you send out like a hundred emails

312
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:59,408
and let's say ninety actually click the

313
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,179
link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not unusual really that's</font>

314
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:02,500
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad but you know I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

315
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in another conference where they</font>

316
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,210
were getting results of like a hundred

317
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fifty two hundred thirty percent so</font>

318
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,830
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a percentage</font>

319
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,409
greater than 100 my guess for doing it

320
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what else so I'm just kept clicking</font>

402
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,240

before and then a great tool what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

427
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,169
does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it basically goes out and based</font>

428
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,540
on a domain name or a lot of different

429
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">factors an IP address range it goes out</font>

430
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,170
and scours the internet for information

431
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,280
for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> backless this entity if it's if</font>

432
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,280
it's a domain name you'll find websites

define<font color="#E5E5E5"> email addresses under this side</font>

434
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:16,230
so the five documents it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,020
for finding email addresses to do for

436

while he provides a whole suite of tools

475
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,010
to make this type of pen testing much

476
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,990
easier it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit on the back</font>

477
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,520
end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works nicely in the backtrack</font>

478
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,549
5 environment it's already set up in

479
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,049
there for you you can download it aside

480
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:11,200
from that and use it but it works best

481
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:13,540
in this environment it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do</font>

482
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,669
is test though it's one tool it's a good

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool but if you want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible and</font>

do things they look great of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee you</font>

485
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,889
might actually have you something else

486
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,730
for your social meeting testing but it's

487
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:31,809
a good tool and it's a standard these

488
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:33,700
days here is the main menu<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that will</font>

489
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,350
talk about this much except that we have

490
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,190
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do spear phishing</font>

491
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:42,480
attacks i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the website tax in</font>

pose in this year's mass mailer will

497
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,279
talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TT USB device in a moment</font>

498
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,190
you can create an access<font color="#E5E5E5"> pole</font>

499
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,509
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honey pot and try people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

500
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,879
come to and connect to it that's kind of

501
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:09,830
fun and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else is sort of like</font>

502
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:14,599
you know maintenance type stuff updating

503
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:21,529
and such 30 questions by the way go hand

504
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:23,840
just question yeah yeah very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much so it</font>

505
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,979
basically set up a fake access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

506
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:37,330
you can disassociate people from your

507
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:40,789
access points and yeah yes yeah yeah

508
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:42,949
exactly there are certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

509
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:46,219
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit in this</font>

510
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:52,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">tutorial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the majority and I think</font>

511
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:53,690
require<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit to be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

512
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:57,259
config files kind of interesting

513
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:59,899
important because for example if you how

514
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:02,899
to detect on the school in the innate

515
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:08,029
config file it'll heal over IP you're

516
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:10,639
using as what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack the the victims</font>

517
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,409
going to come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so if you're</font>

518
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">using for example some kind of netted</font>

519
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:15,440
network and you have the other system

520
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:16,580
somewhere else or if that piece

521
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,070
different you want to actually turn this

522
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,649
off and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can set the IP up where you</font>

523
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:25,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the the actual with them to connect</font>

524
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:27,320
back to on the loose connection let poor

525
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,998
what points listening on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

526
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,869
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other settings they're</font>

527
00:29:28,999 --> 00:29:32,330
kind of important in there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

528
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:38,359
there's a new there's a new setting for

529
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:39,529
the for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java applet attack that</font>

530
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,299
allows you to changing from it on the

531
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual certificate that's brand-new I</font>

532
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:47,269
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last week it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

533
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:50,690
came out so that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in there</font>

534
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:52,110
as well I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just there wasn't</font>

535
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,090
yep

536
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:56,620
so there's a spear phishing attack

537
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,750
vector I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set to dinner this</font>

538
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,219
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use that generate masked me</font>

539
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,039
the emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> and palers and listeners as</font>

540
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,919
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can base your email list on a</font>

541
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,690
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of victims or you can get you you</font>

542
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,400
can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a predefined email template</font>

543
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,870
so if you want to cross an email it

544
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,549
looks like a corporate email or

545
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,750
something special with graphics and such

546
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:16,480
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually create all that at a</font>

547
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,700
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and use that as your template</font>

548
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,900
for it and reuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again later if you</font>

549
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,940
need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the sum of the</font>

550
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,110
website taxes is most interesting I

551
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:32,470
think oops so basic tools you can find

552
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,699
in set the website clone or you can use

553
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,309
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will actually go out and</font>

554
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,539
clone a website for you as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

555
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,520
like a wizard almost you're going

556
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,110
through you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point to an external</font>

557
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,770
site and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this line to clone it that's a</font>

558
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,689
very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> job I really encourage people</font>

559
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,970
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go after the corporate portal if</font>

560
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,649
you're doing a pen test we inevitably

561
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,600
there's always this website that people

562
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:55,029
go to lay them ahead I thought you went

563
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the ham access to the web mail to</font>

564
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,440
their sharepoint staff to their citrix

accounts and stuff but i think it's out

575
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,659
of scope in other words you can also

576
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,070
import you can you wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

577

there's same place available already

578
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,330
there for example there's a gmail on

579

582
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,080
now being attacked looks like it's a

583
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:42,189
great tool to use to demonstrate these

584
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:46,389
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully i'll be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

585
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:48,399

00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:52,550
screen and they's click one and the

705
00:40:48,849 --> 00:40:55,520
listener response to it and you get a

706
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:58,099
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their system works every time</font>

707
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,960
I've tried except for today what works

708
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:04,250
not have it working on a demo so now

709
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,790
what they've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> though to change this</font>

710
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:09,559
they've actually allowed you to change

711
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:15,470
this information to say so where do you

712
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">want oh so you can actually say you know</font>

713
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,470
it's authorized by Microsoft or Java or

714
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,900
something like that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

715
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,549
up and say that the guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote this</font>

716
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">David Kennedy actually it he actually</font>

717
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:25,579
sought legal advice about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

718
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,319
did it because I make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> was okay to</font>

719
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:33,200
do so like talk to the FF and stuff so

720
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay crucial harvesting this is another</font>

721
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,129
kind of basic attack where you set up a

722
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,309
fake site lists that thick<font color="#E5E5E5"> login and you</font>

723
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,750
allow you draw people in with emails to

724
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,309
to log into it and you can collect

725
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Harvard harvest information about their</font>

726
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:48,170
about their logins it has to provide you

727
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">ate and set an HTML report results which</font>

728
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,720
is kind of cool for pen testing alright

729
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:55,869
gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a report to include I asked</font>

730
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,759
him plates for facebook and such but

731
00:41:55,869 --> 00:42:00,349
again i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would i would really hit you</font>

732
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,599
know find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protocol is</font>

733
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:07,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">either the crown jewels are kept on the</font>

00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">web side and gone through that one now</font>

735
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:14,150
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite ack right and i</font>

736
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,299
don't know why i like it it it's not

737
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful honestly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about three</font>

738
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:23,170
years old<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think but</font>

739
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:24,610
because it really never thought the sub

740
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,890
came we thought about human behavior

741
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,080
right there we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

742
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:32,140
think when they browse the web and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

743
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like this one it's the only attack i</font>

744
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,549
know that involves misdirection<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ever</font>

745
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:40,120
made in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction of packets or I</font>

746
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:42,550
mean physical human visual misdirection

747
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,420
look over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look over here and then</font>

748
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,310
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else happens over there it</font>

749
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,220
looks best it gets users who have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

750
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:55,390
of tabs open at one time I'm a treasure

751
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do this as well so whatever what</font>

752
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:02,440
happens these are opens the email they

753
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,300
click the link and<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the page opens</font>

754
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,830
up and they'll read with whatever type

755
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,800
of attack you're trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

756
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:11,020
whether it's a harvest their credentials

757
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,910
or something and so there's this mental

758
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:16,420
connection between the link is clicked

759
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,770
and the site that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

760
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,090
there's a little bit time for suspicion

761
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:22,150
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did they go can click the link</font>

762
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:27,070
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a site hmm the link looks</font>

763
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:30,490
odd the site looks a little odd maybe I

764
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:33,130
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> login here right this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

765
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens in tab nabbing the answer kicks</font>

766
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:39,910
the link the site opens a page and a

767
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a message that says page waiting</font>

768
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:46,629
please wait and that remains them

769
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely there until one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two things</font>

770
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,870
happens they either close the page which

771
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,610
defeats the attack or like me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

772
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,859
lot of tabs open to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another tab to</font>

773
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,330
look at something else for a while so

774
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:59,950
the click the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link is this page loading</font>

775
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:02,590
and in South Africa this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to go</font>

776
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,930
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gmail for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while when they go to you</font>

777
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:09,130
the tab when that tablet is focus it

778
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,140
then loads wherever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're</font>

779
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:14,020
sending them so you could send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

780
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,100
viagra ad right and an email or so like

781
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,750
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they click the link page</font>

782
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,310
loading please wait they go to the tab

783
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,230
and meantime<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're clip approval opens</font>

784
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,759
up the mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> site so the email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

785
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,140
have to reflect with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual content</font>

786
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the site's opening up they can be</font>

787
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,529
there's a disconnect there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

788
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a time disconnect there's an</font>

789
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:36,670
activity disconnect what the users doing

790
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:38,020
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of variables</font>

791
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,540
that could go wrong here with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind</font>

792
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,160
of this kind of tacking up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests but</font>

793
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,770
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really impressed with it</font>

794
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,740
because somebody thought okay what user

795
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:49,270
uses a browser the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't wander</font>

796
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,439
through their tabs anyway they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

797
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior a little bit</font>

798
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,750
more with this attack so I'm really kind

799
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of I'm intrigued by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

800
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,750
time I I don't know how practical is it

801
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,600
may give us an attack before anybody's

802
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:04,560
tab napping before anyway what was your

803
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,560
experience with

804
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,558
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good point yeah</font>

805
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:17,140
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something behind the browser</font>

806
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:18,579
running that yeah so it's it's very

807
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,549
intriguing i'll sit n shut in just a

808
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:22,869
moment the sudden affection affections

809
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:25,930
media the generator you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

810
00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:28,960
generate the executables for a USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive</font>

811
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:35,470
a thumb drive see you on drive to leave

812
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:37,059
around works with metasploit the payload

813
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:38,500
listener can create your own payloads in

814
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:39,700
this year's then we used to sell time

815
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
when we're doing these other attacks as

816
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,549
well but you can do is just for

817
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want do something else</font>

818
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,819
besides what's available and then use

819
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,280
and create this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

820
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:52,058
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with a flexible</font>

821
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way that's mailer it's fun it's</font>

822
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:55,329
part of the spear phishing attacks set

823
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:59,640
and basically it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool to use to</font>

824
00:45:55,329 --> 00:45:59,640
send mass emails out<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they are</font>

825
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the 10 see this is something that's</font>

826
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:10,660
that's included in set what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

827
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:15,849
microcontroller<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's usb-based and</font>

828
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:21,808
actually have one here somewhere oh it's

829
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:21,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here sorry it's a good smell device</font>

830
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,310
I've got this one on a breadboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

831
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">home somewhere doesn't have the pins on</font>

832
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:35,560
it that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just connect to a</font>

833
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,870
adapter now what this is it's it's a

834
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,820
it's a development board and you can

835
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,380
program it to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you want</font>

836
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,260
pretty much you can put servo motors on

837
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,060
it LEDs all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of projects I think</font>

838
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,430
it's a cool board for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it's</font>

839
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,230
risky based<font color="#CCCCCC"> which you can also do it</font>

840
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:53,259
it's important here as you can emulate a

841
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:56,640
keyboard so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you plug it in it gets</font>

842
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:59,230
power it starts sending keep keystrokes

843
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right as if it were keyboard typing</font>

844
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,620
on its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own now this device here</font>

845
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,610
unfortunately i don't have programmed

846
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,670
the what I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home somewhere I</font>

847
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:13,390
couldn't find that's the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

848
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:17,200
but I didn't have something sit on this

849
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:19,990
one and get all uses power to start

850
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,370
running program they're fairly

851
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,580
inexpensive they're about sixteen

852
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:27,609
dollars and let me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring up a</font>

853
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,540
notepad here this is kind of pathetic

854
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,540
really what I did with it

855
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,720
plug it in and it's going to eventually

856
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,049
come up with a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

857
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,959
type it but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

858
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,850
control keys you can do escape any

859
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,050
combination keys on your keyboard 10

860
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:56,290
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah welcome Alaska not too</font>

861
00:47:53,050 --> 00:48:00,940
impressive but so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be used</font>

862
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:02,140
to this could be this could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

863
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,660
run commands on someone's computer in

864
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,950
the plug it in so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

865
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,720
them you want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the website</font>

866
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,660
you simply head and bring up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

867
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,730
line type into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I explore with the</font>

868
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,960
URL and they can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the site that has</font>

869
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,150
the payload you want to deliver to them

870
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,950
all right you can kind of kept egging in

871
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,870
it the downside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this one is that it's</font>

872
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">really expensive you don't believe 100 Z</font>

873
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:27,549
sling around parking lots right they're

874
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:29,609
kind of pricey the you go back here

875
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,610
again

876
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,329
that's in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was using a device</font>

877
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,279
has done to detect there's nothing I'd

878
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:45,799
electrical bring on the system so

879
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:47,869
there's no anti virus or malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

880
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:49,640
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can as commands you open command</font>

881
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:51,470
prompt you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch web browsers you</font>

882
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,160
can now some new things have been done

883
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:57,259
with this you can solder a microSD card

884
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:59,390
to it and you can live a larger payloads

885
00:48:57,259 --> 00:49:01,279
because the memory is limited you can

886
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:03,739
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like these the hard drive you</font>

887
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:06,549
can reading some memory much larger so a

888
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:09,319
lot of the attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would require</font>

889
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:13,059
more space more memory you can pull off

890
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:15,890
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this now downsize it's really slow</font>

891
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:17,390
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very slow it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

892
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,979
noisy when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plug it in you see things</font>

893
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening your screen it's been easy to</font>

894
00:49:18,979 --> 00:49:23,629
see that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to put delays in</font>

895
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,700
because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to program it</font>

896
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:27,049
and get something on it you plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

897
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,109
to program it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts typing in your</font>

898
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:34,849
you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDE screen so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

899
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:36,440
watch that so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's included as part</font>

900
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:38,630
of the set you can create<font color="#CCCCCC"> pills weird</font>

901
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,099
and set so delivering this I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

902
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:42,739

906
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:51,950
put intel or something all right and you

907
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,319
can actually wire it inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> and like can</font>

908
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:58,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug it in and you know watch your</font>

909
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:00,219
watch your system right up with activity

910
00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:00,219
there

911
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:10,169
yeah now you're sure yeah I picture the

916
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,880
all because the third party SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading</font>

917
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,560
solutions are usually fee-based and the

918
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,300
kind of clinking that work but you can

919
