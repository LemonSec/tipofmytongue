00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,910
good afternoon everyone I have the

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:15,150
pleasure of introducing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you today Joe</font>

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,789
Jarzombek Joe is actually the director

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">for software assurance and he leads the</font>

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,380
garment interagency public and private

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,019
collaboration efforts with industry

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">academy and standards organizations to</font>

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,348
shift the security paradigm from

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,590
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been very reactive with</font>

10
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of a pad cycle mentality to that</font>

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,149
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very proactive to build test</font>

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,800
and then deploy throughout the life

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,590
cycle through security education and

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,078
training Joe Jarzombek he addresses the

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,340
department of homeland security cyber

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,320
security initiatives focused on

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,379
mitigating risks attributable to

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,579
exploitable software and how public and

19
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,769
private collaboration is necessary to

20
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">improve this whole landscape of</font>

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,320
cybersecurity itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually very</font>

I enjoyed his contributions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel</font>

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,519
so I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you is</font>

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be equally stimulating as well</font>

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,439
today Joe is actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,350
addressing means for measuring software

for his leadership in information

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,829
commendable for his industry glad

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,799
Cyber Security Awareness Month I think

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,020
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of appropriate because last</font>

defining event in US history that caused

the stand up of the US Department<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

46
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,240
Homeland Security that was 911 and 911

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,229
to me was the classic zero-day attack

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's from the message here is that</font>

49
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,390
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand zero-day attacks</font>

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,639
are actually preventable fact the

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,169
message is zero-day attacks our nice way

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a nice convenient way of blaming</font>

53
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,519
somebody else on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that there are</font>

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,660
exploit

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,510
points that we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done something</font>

56
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,850
about but for whatever reason we have

57
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,730
chosen not to do that and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area of</font>

58
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,359
software in particular every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,600
these are preventable and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that you understand is that the</font>

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,750
classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 9-11 was</font>

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,820
the fact that this was a convergence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

63
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,160
our different<font color="#CCCCCC"> disciplines but what we're</font>

64
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,290
finding out in cyberspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's becomes a</font>

65
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,450
convergence of not just cyber but with

66
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,670
the physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a convergence of</font>

67
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,890
disciplines it's no one discipline can

68
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,290
fix this the idea that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is</font>

69
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,899
going to do it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do and</font>

70
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,090
when we looked at what happened on 911

71
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,970
this was a classic case of systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

72
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,790
had been determined to be safe meaning

73
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they were designed built deployed</font>

74
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,019
and operated to be safe but<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

75
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,030
weren't designed built deployed and

76
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,790
operated to be secure hundreds of people

77
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">died and I was wondered about that and I</font>

78
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,450
talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys about I said how is</font>

79
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,370
it that you determine this and declared

80
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,230
the system safe and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people died and</font>

81
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,030
they said well the security guys we

82
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,500
didn't I say wait a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but even from</font>

83
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,060
a safety perspective which by the way

84
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,300
has a lot of statutory regulatory

85
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,830
guidance we've got laws behind it that

86
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,010
says you had to at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least make</font>

87
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,900
assumptions about security and bottom

88
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,829
line is they didn't this was and so the

89
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,410
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to be talking</font>

90
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is understanding how all the</font>

91
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,160
players come<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a team sport when</font>

92
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,600
we come together and there will also be

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,540
people said when you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

94
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really hard and they'll say it's</font>

95
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,660
expensive and I say based on the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

96
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,150
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I agree with you because for</font>

97
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,459
the most part now and I realized I'm

98
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,980
preaching to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choir here but most</font>

99
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,930
people practice security afterwards they

100
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,119
bring in security to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

101
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,980
afterwards and when you do that it is

102
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive because</font>

103
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,149
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to bolt this on and so</font>

104
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,859
what happens is security the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we do</font>

105
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,120
it today not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it cost you more</font>

106
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,830
art slows you down and and in fact it it

107
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,108
to the point when you're building you're

108
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,900
putting in firewalls DM Z's everything

109
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,700
else because why because we have this

110
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,770
fundamentally flawed infrastructure

111
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,880
built on software that we didn't think

112
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about security from that perspective</font>

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,670
and built-in security the message here

114
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,859
is that it actually enables resilience

115
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,630
of our enterprises if you have secure

116
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,670
products in the first place you don't

117
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,000
have to do all these things very much

118
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brakes brakes aren't there to stop</font>

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,710
you brakes are actually in our things

120
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that enable you to go fast because it</font>

121
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,190
gives you control built-in security

122
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,169
gives you control and more particularly

123
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,780
gives you resilience for what you're

124
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,920
focused on now our focus within the

125
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,909
Department of Homeland Security's

126
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,290
looking our nation's critical

127
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,330
infrastructure for which the federal

128
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">government does not own or operate we</font>

129
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,469
have to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collaboration with</font>

130
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,750
those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> own own these and operate</font>

131
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,310
those aspects but when we look at these

132
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,930
the more you peel back of this because

133
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,120
most people think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the physical</font>

134
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,220
infrastructure that all enabled or

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,530
controlled by software and in fact it's

136
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">not just about control systems but it's</font>

137
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application software that runs these</font>

138
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,260
things and the more and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more you look at</font>

139
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,600
it you peel<font color="#CCCCCC"> it back you understand that</font>

140
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,580
they're fundamentally flawed in fact you

141
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,110
almost don't want to know what they are

142
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,789
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there but we understand that's</font>

143
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,750
our big risk component we also

144
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,810
understand that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

145
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,360
interconnected and and we we know that

146
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,770
one organizations risk if you're

147
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,350
interconnected with them become your

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:43,620
risk as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we hear people say</font>

149
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:46,140
but we we have security we've put in our

150
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,780
firewalls we have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ we implement</font>

151
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">security a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people put in security</font>

152
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,900
features and we wonder why is it that

153
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,090
we're still being breached why that why

154
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,380
is the hacking still going on well

155
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,729
fundamentally it's because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

156
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,159
going through your security controls

157
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,340
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through your application</font>

158
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,110
software and you've heard and some of

159
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,450
the presentations here Michael Howard

160
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,480
even talked about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that the way</font>

161
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,740
they're getting around these systems

162
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,090
they are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through your security</font>

163
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,220
controls they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

164
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,390
application software and and you're

165
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,760
familiar with those term sequel

166
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,400
injection buffer overflow we've actually

167
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,890
codified these and to a measurable

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">discernible way so that you can talk</font>

169
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these things and we can actually</font>

170
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it within a business context of why</font>

171
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,349
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should care about this meaning if</font>

172
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a buffer overflow there is an</font>

173
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,710
exploit associated with it that there's

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,560
also a mission risk associated with it

175
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,150
and so people simply aren't going<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

176
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">going around that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's interesting</font>

177
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,390
is

178
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,930
exploitable software weaknesses are the

179
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,280
sources for future zero-day attacks and

180
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,380
and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said if you have a</font>

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,400
zero-day attack it's a very convenient

182
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,780
way of saying but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not my fault and</font>

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,370
in fact we've gone in and talk to

184
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,200
organization say would you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

185
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,060
we can go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do static code analysis</font>

186
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,430
I mean this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple at the code</font>

187
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,680
level but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even you can bring in experts</font>

188
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,660
to look at and we can say here's all

189
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,000
your exploit points I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had</font>

190
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,150
people tell me why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to know</font>

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,950
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of a sad statement</font>

192
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,870
because they understand what they're

193
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,729
admitting they're saying if you tell me

194
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,260
where my exploit points are and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

195
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,110
do anything about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we get</font>

196
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,520
breached now I'm responsible but if i

197
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,290
can say i didn't know anything about

198
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that somehow but that's somebody else's</font>

199
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">fault that's our challenge point today</font>

200
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,960
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> congress is actually started</font>
