performed hundreds of application test

73
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,110
from mainframe to web to mobile

74
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,189

mobile talk today and we're going to

76
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover secure coding and beyond what to</font>

77
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,180
look for when assessing iphone

78
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,400
application so the primary targets talk

79
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,469
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be both pen testers and</font>

80
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,790
application developers hopefully if

81
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,080
you're into even one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

82
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,689
that both<font color="#E5E5E5"> those groups EG little bit of</font>

83
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,580
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this talk first things first</font>

84
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,860
we're a cover the basics you know what

85
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,570
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talking about when we do a</font>

86
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,030
setup for testing we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font>

87
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,380
out how to test this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

88
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,650
do secure storage of data and

89
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,790
credentials and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally in overton</font>

90
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,890
local storage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> caching the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

92
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,040
information that you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

93
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,900
expecting it to and then we're going to

94
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more classic examples</font>

95
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,500
things like client-side sanitization

96
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,990
things we have to worry about in the web

97
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">development as well you know secure code</font>

98
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,430
guidelines how those might differ from

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,950
traditional applications we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

100
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,569
little bit about push notifications and

101
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,400
then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know some more on</font>

102
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,680
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> communications and then we'll try</font>

103
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sum up in conclusion how you should</font>

104
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,609
be approaching these applications as a

105
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:54,709
developer and as a tester so the basics

106
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,150
just the facts why people attacking

107
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,340
mobile applications well why does

108
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,230
anybody attack anything was really three

109
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,450
main reasons we think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first reason</font>

110
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,090
is stealing money right people don't do

111
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fun not alternating words it's</font>

112
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:10,330
a big business stealing moneys doing

113
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,160
credentials credit card information etc

114
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,690
embarrassing people hacktivists so

115
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,670
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a lot of news</font>

116
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,980
anonymous and low second the rest of it

117
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,490
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> million other groups out</font>

118
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,560
there that are trying to get there cause

119
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,840
they celeb out there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

120
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,579
recent one poverty is going to be the

121
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,190
Komodo hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> they raining hackers told</font>

123
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are not hacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary for</font>

124
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,770
money but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got a sense of patriotic</font>

125
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,969
duty or because they think there's some

126
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,130
injustice they want to write in the

127
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,870
world the last one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get famous</font>

128
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,150
right just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name out there I'm</font>

the guy who broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> paypal's application</font>

130
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:49,640
on the guy who broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank X application</font>

131
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of mobile</font>

132
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,470
applications are ultimately just an

133
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,640
application and a smaller device the

134
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,990
reason we kind of got started with this

135
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,460
is because we had a client who asked one

136
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,230
of our sales guys if we knew anything

137
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,330
about mobile apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these new iphone</font>

138
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,890
new thing with iphones and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

139
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,300
sales guy being a sales guy said of

140
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,460
course we have a son I there's nothing

141
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,959
but mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications all day long and</font>

142
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,930
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said can you get a mobile apps</font>

143
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,130
right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yeah absolutely sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent</font>

144
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a lot of research and kind of</font>

145
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into it and is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

146
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,110
to me and so I kind of did a lot of

147
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,689
independent research along with carrot

148
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've taken what we found over the</font>

149
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,080
last couple years both for our clients

150
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,570
wasn't been researching how to put

151
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:33,350
together in a cohesive talk to hopefully

152
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,540
spread the wealth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah that's</font>

153
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,670
another big goal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is not</font>

154
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,560
securing the device itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> or talking</font>

155
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the operating system it's going to</font>

156
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,079
be you know making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you're not</font>

157
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the weakest link in the chain and so you</font>

158
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,660
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason we don't want to talk</font>

159
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> device is there's been all</font>

160
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,319
sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the news and there's</font>

161
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">plenty of research around that seems</font>

162
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,260
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to just plug in a</font>

163
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:58,339
stolen iphone into computer jailbreak it

164
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,780
you know upload some scripts and it

165
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,610
downloads the keychain and you can start

166
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,810
cracking that then and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

167
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to all sorts of username</font>

168
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,500
passwords and so one of the things we're

169
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is making sure that</font>

170
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're assuming that malware is on the</font>

171
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,730
device and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have access to</font>

172
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,530
some of this information yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

173
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good to assume a default</font>

174
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,860
insecure state when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about</font>

175
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,439
applications putting on a customer's

176
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,550
device because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of time is</font>

177
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
going to be true the device is going to

178
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,180
be compromised in some way

179
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,120
so two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their kind of high risk issues</font>

180
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can eval one what kind of talk</font>

181
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,590
about the great<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications of this but</font>

182
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,390
essentially some guy put out on iphone

183
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,710
application the App Store that purported

184
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,650
to do one thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it really did</font>

185
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:42,350
is it stole users iPhones lock passwords

186
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,590
and so he was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security researcher</font>

187
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,600
ostensibly and he said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he did it in</font>

188
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,010
order to better understand we use for

189
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone passwords and we want to</font>

190
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:56,380
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the number one iphone</font>

191
00:13:50,120 --> 00:14:01,430
password is 9999 anybody else four zeros

192
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:03,080
23 for anybody else that's right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2580</font>

193
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,449
if it is a number one iphone pass which

194
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,330
is right down the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 580 second</font>

195
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,810
0852 and then they also have 150<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 99</font>

196
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,030
99 + 0000 so what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson from this</font>

197
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,890
right is people pick bad passwords

198
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,020
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we've known in the</font>

199
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:21,410
security industry for very long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time how</font>

200
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,910
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here have an iphone I will</font>

201
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,459
have a four digit numeric password for

202
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,360
their iphone right because it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

203
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,610
a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the butt when you're walking</font>

204
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,900
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street you're driving to log in</font>

205
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,300
and check your email if you have a

206
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,550
multi-character 16 digit password right

207
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,449
so why it's not users have you know 1 2

208
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,530
3 4 to 5 80 so even we who in the

209
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,830
security industry you should probably

210
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">know better generally choose convenience</font>

211
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,590
over securities there's no need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

212
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,470
aware of when you work with sensitive

213
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,140
data on the iphone another prominent

214
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,970
hack to say we're older now was the

215
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">paypals iphone app no matter what the</font>

216
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,870
root cause of that were also<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

217
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,939
essentially what happened there is that

218
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,590
paypal created<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application so that</font>

219
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,090
it is easier to use in the development

220
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,880
environment and they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this by getting</font>

221
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,290
rid of ssl<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificates check and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

222
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,510
they rush to production and guess what

223
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,829
they forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove the code that to</font>

224
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,030
say was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell certificate check so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

225
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,890
mean anybody can man in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

226
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,709
this application<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it's me a bad</font>

227
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,499
time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a paypal developer people</font>

228
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of kind</font>

229
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:20,429
the common causes and effects of all

230
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:24,209
these iPhone applications and the girl

231
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:26,879
from there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the facts ma'am how</font>

232
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:29,819
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people attacking mobile apps new and</font>

233
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,579
unsafe operating systems you know you

234
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:33,988
have these new OS is coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS is a</font>

new OS Android is in your West

236
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:39,539

mistakes when they build new os's new

238
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,109
software it's just the way it goes it's

239
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:45,299
you know one of those things there's not

240
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,859
an apocryphal story about how when the

241
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,449
bill windows vista they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

242
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:51,389
rewrite a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nepean code from</font>

243
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:53,159
scratch to clear out a lot of the rubble

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess I was in the windows networking</font>

249
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:05,279
had in the first beta versions of

<font color="#E5E5E5">I just kind of really old attacks that</font>

253
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,729
people fix a long time ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

254
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,659
forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> the how to fix them so what kind</font>

255
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:17,909
of see little bit that with operating

256
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,309
systems terrible developers you don't

257
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:21,449
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe right i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

doesn't care about security that may may

260
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:29,098
not make you terrible it really depends

261
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,359
clueless users who don't know they

262
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:32,159
should care I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

263
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:33,929
most users you know most users don't

264
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,359
have an idea of security in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their mind</font>

265
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:39,869
or they may you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch something on</font>

266
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:41,339
good morning america or whatever morning

phone security and our hacker is

269
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,919
stealing your children secrets online

270
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:48,719

271
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,949
extent of the security knowledge but i

272
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,559
think that unfortunately most you just

273
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,689
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand it so you can't</font>

the first day which is the apple store

we're kind of touching that briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really discuss</font>

modifying other applications data on the

just straight up iphone apps day in day

296
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:42,780
out ok so send out the testing

we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time and we don't think</font>

312
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,418
the neat the reality is that there's

users and your servers without having to

316
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:25,710
even bother doing that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so how</font>

317
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,059
we willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test an iphone application</font>

318
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,500
let's say you have an iphone application

319
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,360
either one that your company is writing

322
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,809
the iphone store is important to note

323
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,020
that the IPA file is compiled for the

324
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:43,440
ARM architecture of the a5 chip on the

327
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,168

they'll run on both environments with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

346
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is because we're going to be running the</font>

the next one with you at the certs this

352
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,640
one it's fairly straightforward you set

353
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,650
up your foxy you set up your web of your

354
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,350
web browser to point through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proxy</font>

355
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,970
you go to some SSL enabled say it pops

356
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,490
up a little window saying it's insecure

357
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you view the certificate and then you to</font>

358
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,370
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you click on the root-level</font>

359
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,590
certificate so if it's perfect it'll be

360
00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,520
the ports for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA you export</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

361
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:02,169
certificate as a pem file has to be a

362
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,870
pem file you can use another format like

363
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:08,410
de are the iphones doesn't recognize it

364
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:11,409
so you exploit it as a pen file you save

365
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,760
it somewhere the easiest way to get the

366
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,520
cert on the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to email it to</font>

367
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,080
yourself super easy way you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

368
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,610
cert and it will install automatically

369
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,100
this does so they're open up some

370
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:24,909
questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you were going to</font>

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,620
let's say you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the simulator</font>

431
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,658
instead of the emulator there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

432
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,699
advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> to using the simulator you</font>

433
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:33,830
can have a lot more access to fun tool

434
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,600
or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second as well as</font>

435
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,189
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to test things on</font>

436
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,860
the simulator versus having to fiddle

437
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:42,380
around on your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make it work</font>

438
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,678
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way so first you have to do is you</font>

448
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:11,269
to complain yeah so we're going to pay

449
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:13,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 bucks a little bit for that or you</font>

get a free for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox a so officially</font>

451
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,289
to do is you open the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trustor that's</font>

452
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:20,658
equal 83 database you go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> T</font>

453
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,760
settings table and then you can see

454
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:25,610
there in my very small screen shot that

455
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,408
you have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sha-1 fingerprint</font>

456
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,879
of the root CA certificate so when you

457
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:30,080
export that<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate you open it up</font>

458
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,630
in the key chain tool if you're on a Mac

459
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,970
you look at the sha-1 fingerprint copy

460
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> paste and you put it right into the</font>

461
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">table the format is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not just the sha-1</font>

462
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,549
fingerprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweet x single quote sha-1</font>

463
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,590
fingerprint without learning spaces

464
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:43,820
single quote who knows why they have

465
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that format they just decided that's</font>

466
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,500
what I wanted to do at this point you

467
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this difficult in the simulator if</font>

468
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,269
you tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to proxy necessary the proxy</font>

469
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,889
you won't get that pop up saying

470
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:56,480
untrusted certificate at a lot of math

471
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:57,409
you trust any certificate your proxy

472
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,940
serves up

473
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:03,110
so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that well then what do</font>

474
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:09,540
you do next anybody recognize this icon

475
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:10,949
what is it and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the SMX code</font>

476
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the instruments tool that</font>

477
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,550
it's shipped with Xcode and instruments

478
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,100
I think I heard of sysinternals from

479
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:19,320
windows some people instruments is

480
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,000
basically sysinternals for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac super</font>

481
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,649
super super handy if you're doing a pen

482
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against a thick line in this case a</font>

483
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,690
mobile application all you do is you

484
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,240
point out the PID of the running iphone

485
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,370
application attach it to that PID and

486
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">they give you everything it does so you</font>

487
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:38,820
can attach it to the PID and you can see

488
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:41,490
things like all activity io inputs

489
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:45,030
director your IRS file attributes<font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font>

490
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:47,430

491
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,680
users to store data securely and then

492
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,880
you can attach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that PID you run the</font>

493
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,560
application run through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

494
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,570
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the places writing to disk all the</font>

495
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,220
places it's reading from desk all the

496
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,090
network operations if that's very low

497
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,210
than they look at how the application

498
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,909
works this is the example of sort

499
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,290
information you can say so you can see

500
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,300
here this highlighted highlighted line

501
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,580
this happened when i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a website</font>

502
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,110
and then I press the home button we

503
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,510
press the home button iphone takes a

504
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,550
screenshot of the screen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it saves it</font>

505
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,780
the directory so you can then go on the

506
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,330
file system and find that screenshot

507
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,620
we'll talk a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about that in the</font>

508
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:27,510
insecure storage and local caching of

509
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:29,280
data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so you know typically how you</font>

510
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,110
store credentials on the device is going

511
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,030
to be with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain however the</font>

512
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,810
keychains going to provide some form of

513
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,610
indefinite storage yo so if the

514
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,399
application is installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you install</font>

515
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,020
some credentials with it and you remove

516
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the application the key chain has no way</font>

518
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,100

519
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,750
device yo can you descript can you throw

520
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,030
our credentials security without the key

521
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,090
chain you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you know don't let that</font>

522
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:59,430
feature make you lazy however yo don't

523
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,020
store it interesting the keychain unless

524
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,570
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about certain things like</font>

525
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,860
will mention a little bit you know an

526
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,990
attacker will have access to all once

527
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,189
the jailbreak the phone if they have

528
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical access to a phone as well</font>

529
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,650
and so here we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> keychain</font>

530
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised through jee jailbreaking so</font>

531
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,650
through a series of steps you know they

532
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,440
retrieve the password stored in the

533
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,820
keychain the jailbreak is there an

534
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,600
iphone something they picked up at a bar

535
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably left by an apple employee their</font>

536
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,409

access copy the scripts over to the

538
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:34,280
iphone it compromises the key chain and

539
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:41,209
the script<font color="#CCCCCC"> to output the victims</font>

540
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:43,250
password then so where should you saw

541
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,620
them not on device at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in plain</font>

542

manager or supervisor manager again the

544
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,530
firefox plugin we opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

545
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,510
databases and found things like

usernames and they're from a bank

547
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,800

550
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,440
who jailbreak the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone will have</font>

551
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:06,050
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information we're very</font>

552
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">cognizant as consultants now a lot of</font>

553
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> times we go in there and we'll see</font>

554
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,290
an application will say you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

555
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,780
wrong fix it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's easy for us</font>

556
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,940
to say fix it it's harder for you as a

557
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,440
developer to actually fix it so I think

558
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a big problem with consultants is</font>

559
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,330
that they'll suggest a course of action

560
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,010
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it won't give you the tools you need</font>

561
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue on the course of action so</font>

562
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,870
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that fact we kind of thought</font>

563
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,090
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit how you want to</font>

564
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,530
securely stored data at rest things

565
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,959
might want to look for and so when

566
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:38,930
you're reviewing an application later

567
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,280
viewing your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> application you all</font>

568
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">look for database it calls make sure</font>

569
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,430
injections not possible so even if they

570
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,360
don't jailbreak the device you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

571
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,760
make sure if they can't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,470
using Core Data or any database rail you

574
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,730
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's another</font>

576
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,120
authenticating that information again

577
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:58,820
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to trust things</font>

578
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,860
implicitly that come from the device as

579
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,040
I'll say probably a couple more times

580
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to imagine that it's jailbroken</font>

581
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,389

582
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:13,100
DEF CON Network and then design an

583
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:14,840
application from there you are so

584
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,300
recommendations for our non credential

585
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,090
data don't store it on the phone if

586
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,730
possible so you never have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so easy</font>

587
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,220
to lose

588
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,710
much so fast you know these hold an

589
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,390
enormous amount of information and if

590
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,280
you lose your device that information

591
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:32,190
shall be considered compromised at that

592
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,899
point it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of time yeah</font>

593
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,790
require user enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> a passcode you know</font>

594
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,490
this can still be brute forced once the

595
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,440
encrypted text is found and it usually

596
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:43,020
provides a poor user experience on

597
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,070
mobile devices especially you know you

598
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,840
know the more steps they have to go

599
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,460
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> to access your application the</font>

600
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,230
less likely they are to use it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

601
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:53,760
a competitor so let's say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

602
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,950
large amount of information on the phone

603
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,379
and we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> store it on the phone not</font>

604
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,870
in the cloud everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> make up secure in</font>

605
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,820
case the device is lost we could reverse

606
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,918
the process maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to store the</font>

607
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,720
key out in the cloud so somebody has to

608
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,669
enter a passcode it goes out to the

609
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,490
cloud gets much larger key so they use a

610
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:13,380
pin code or something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

611
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,140
way if the device is asked in reported

612
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,220
stolen you know you can remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

613
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,000
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud and they will be able to</font>

614
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it even with the pin code however</font>

615
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will require some sort of always-on</font>

616
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,340
connection so they won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to use</font>

617
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in airplane mode or something like</font>

618
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,889
that obviously one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big benefits</font>

619
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,540

621
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,889

622
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,910
you start making requirements on users

623
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,650
like you have to connect to the network

624
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,350
you maybe get some pushback from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">business unit it may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very secure way to do it though so it</font>

628
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,309
kind of comes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you want to</font>

629
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,990
have a usable application you want to

00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:56,040
have a secure application<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

don't store credentials in the keifa in

right i mean i'll admit it my password

657
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,929
sucks it's four digit numeric there is

658

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many you know look familiar</font>

crack a hundred thousand keys in a

00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,379
you can crack it an iphone pin just like

675
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:37,059
that's not exactly what i would call

00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,850
there's no general is here after the

679

last time there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentleman to give</font>

me a dirty look what

681
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,929
yes that's true that's if somebody has a

682
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,429
phone and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to plug it</font>

683
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:58,140
in but if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually steal your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

684
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,580

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,320
off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their proof forcing an offline</font>

686
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,149
you don't have that same protection so

687
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,770
that that protection and what he said

688
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,420
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the phone will allow you to</font>

689
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a setting you put in the wrong pin</font>

690
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,720
too many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> it erases all the data</font>

691
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,890
and that's fine against the casual

692
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,390
attacker yeah so many picks up your

693
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,620
phone in a bar and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

694
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,260
steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone because hey it's a free</font>

695
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPhone but somebody who's going outfit</font>

696
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,980
because they say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,110

all your email and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials through your keychain</font>

700
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
they're not going to be just trying to

701
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,418
guess it randomly they're going to

702
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,230
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key chains right approve</font>

703
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:33,390
for offline that is a good point so

<font color="#E5E5E5">story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credentials specting stupid users</font>

and stupid users are seeing the most

706
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,710
protection so you know your application

707
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,380
to require some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of strong password</font>

708
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,820
so a plus characters alphanumeric and

709
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,790
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be up to be a business</font>

710

know may harm the user experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,969
the data is sensitive enough you may

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,580
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that precaution you know</font>

00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,130
they don't go to make those connections

745
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,610
at somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more tech-savvy</font>

747
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,050
caching so we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> before about I ran</font>

748
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,720
an eye for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application I attached the</font>

749
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,100
PID in this case are just Safari and

750
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,839
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I press the home button and we saw</font>

751
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> PNG file being right into the disk</font>

752
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,300
so what exactly is that PNG file well

753
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,899
that's a screenshot where they stored

754
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,030
one of their take in who can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

755
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:26,810
so i accidentally data right so they're

756
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,940
being stored on the local file system

757
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,110
for an indefinite amount of time

758
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,460
basically until<font color="#E5E5E5"> i arrested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> size are too</font>

759
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,679
many screenshots we need to clear some

760
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,270
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what that does is that when you</font>

761
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,100
close an application that i feel you

762
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:41,040
press the home button it shrinks down

763
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,839
when you open it back up again it pulls

764
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,790
up that screenshot and what that does it

765
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,710
provides a very nice user experience for

766
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,029
the user they think okay this iphone is

767
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,800
very snappy i can close<font color="#E5E5E5"> out an</font>

768
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,940
application over up right away they

769
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,169
don't realize they're just seeing a

770
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,129
picture of the application for the

771
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:54,270
application actually loads in the

772
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:56,520
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it replaces the</font>

773
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,380
picture so it's primarily just to make

774
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,880
the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to use make</font>

775
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,550
people think the iphone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe faster</font>

776
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">than it actually is so how do you</font>

777
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:09,120
protect against app and again a very

778
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,190
obviously named attribute in the

00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,350

780
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,810
application there is a setting you can

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:18,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">add and it's called UI application exits</font>

on suspend anyone wanting a guess of

783

what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means I know it's pretty</font>

784
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,200
tricky you guys are very fun

785
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,790
come on what do they mean it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

786
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,620
exits on suspend right so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aggies</font>

787
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,700
don't suspend then it doesn't have than

788
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,080
it knows it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come back and</font>

789
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it doesn't take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot cuz it</font>

790
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,810
knows it and have a snappy experience

791
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,880
coming back because application is

792
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,100
closed down so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

793
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,570
have things like plain text credit card

numbers or credentials whatever else

795

797
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,200
information and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

798
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,060
anybody in here is like me and has

799
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,419
turned off auto complete globally but a

00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,680
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think a few min</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Woodward's is a small price to pay for</font>

802
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,339
this not happening to you however<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

803
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,520
it's at it tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct itself and</font>

learn so if you keep using the same word

over and over again it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

806
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,770
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work does anyone know</font>

807
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,029
where that word stored or were those

808
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:18,950
words are stored on the device so it's

809
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,690
going to be somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's just</font>

810
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:24,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">a file in there that keeps a list of</font>

811
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,730
these words that you use and so on

812
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,650
attackers can be able to get that list

813
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,020
so we have to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

814
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:33,920

your users type in incorrectly and for

applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to it and</font>

818
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,870
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off auto complete</font>

819
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,190
on things like credit card fields it's

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible that you could have things like</font>

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">set the you know auto correction to none</font>

825
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,690
so you can make sure that sensitive

fields don't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto correct even</font>

if other fields on your application

00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,890
might and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're going to talk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about to our client side sanitization so</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is especially popular you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we've seen a ton of this and web</font>

know flash applications and mobile

applications to it seems like developers

837
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,440
kind of eventually learn the lesson that

838
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can apply side sanitization and</font>

whatever technologies are working on but

in the new technology and all of a

sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's back to magic and I oh I'll</font>

842
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,930
do client-side sanitization because it's

common misconceptions are just aren't

856
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,650
translate really well into some of our

857
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:03,359
iPhone applications you know we've

858
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,400
tested the application to over and over

859
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,019
and we still find this today where they

860
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,430
rely on JavaScript controls hidden

861
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:11,549
fields for authorization and

862
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,069
authentication controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON responses</font>

863
00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:15,599
we can manipulate and you know

864
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:18,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">information stored and flash objects</font>

865
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,279
same type of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be stored in a a</font>

866
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:22,799
mobile application that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can decompile</font>

867
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:24,089
or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be you know even stored</font>

868
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:26,069
on the device itself that we can

869
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:30,029
directly gain access to without even

870
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:32,099
decompiling it and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

871
00:38:30,029 --> 00:38:33,749
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> robe clients so you know</font>

872
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,349
attackers can write apps you know some

873
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:38,488
somewheres testers can too and so you

874
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,039
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side secrets can be</font>

875
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:42,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">decompile yeah we could let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

876
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,809
application that doesn't do any

877
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:48,029
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we can yell you compile</font>

878
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">secrets out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the application we don't</font>

879
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,150
care if it's off you scheduled right now

880
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,069
so someone from out<font color="#CCCCCC"> or could stand up</font>

881
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,299
bring up you can't decompile this

882
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,788
application we put all sorts of

883
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:58,469
protections against it that may be true

884
00:38:56,789 --> 00:38:59,880
right now but in six months that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may all</font>

885
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,499
change and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want that</font>

886
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,420
information on the device and somebody

887
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:06,779
in six months just has to click a script

888
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,559
and he has all that information then so

889
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:11,819
you know we also can tell rely on that

890
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:16,200
being you know the apple store

891
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:18,450
preventing everything so you know with

00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android at multiple stores and they've</font>

893
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,950
already had malware being sent through

894
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:24,450
there with apple store we have to assume

895
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there where ain't no</font>

897
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,549
rogue app applications have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

898
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:32,309
there's a flashlight application outside

899

a secret tethering<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature and in this</font>

world which allow your phone to tether

901
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,130
before that wasn't an option of the

903
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,460
pulled by apple again we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> application that stole users</font>

really in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

912
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,869
they don't ask for source code they

913
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,310
don't do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk-through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the source code</font>

914
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,200
the people testing these applications

915
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,509
are not security testers there are more

916
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,100
like QA testers right there checking for

917
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,570
naughty pictures and naughty words make

918
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,770
sure that the rating is appropriate and

919
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:17,300
also to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's not</font>

920
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,660
duplicating functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> on iphone</font>

921
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,950
which is one thing they disallow so just

922
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,899
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the apple</font>

923
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,310
store if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a competent developer</font>

924
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,700
you will be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write an application</font>

925
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:31,190
that can both pass the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone</font>

926
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,740
store checks and still do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

927
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,300
really nasty things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the iphone and</font>

928
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,640
again a popular way for android to do

929
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's take the top 20 apps decompile them</font>

adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojans are from the back on the</font>

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">even says I've angry birds are free</font>

933
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,940
awesome so they download it and instead

00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:51,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Trojan I mean it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a great</font>

935
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation so you know how do you do this</font>

936
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,990
right same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as any client-server</font>

937
00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:00,109
application or web application let the

server-side enforces assume everything

939
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:05,029
coming from y'all the device was from a

940
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,710
road client and enforce secured

941
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,750

cells being enforced or whatever you're

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:15,770
using to protect the information being

944
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:19,339
sent across and so you know what exactly

945
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">applies in this world and we're still</font>

946
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,359
using this side we've modified it a

947
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,430
little bit so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worried</font>

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,230
an iphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> app for iOS applications about</font>

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,180
unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the browser however</font>

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some asterisks there you know if</font>

you're making a direct call to the

order flowers or for mastering problems

to access the device itself but

989
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,180
typically what you know the greater

1005
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:41,349
so you know we're shifting paradigms

1006
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,510
we're going to talk about these yeah we

1007

hate ourselves for saying that talk

<font color="#E5E5E5">about each of these days in a little bit</font>

1013
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,140
reviewing local and remote inputs making

team your security testers know about

1029
00:44:26,049 --> 00:44:29,980
those and look forward it's certainly

1030
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,869
something that we can get ahead of and

1031
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,700
there's really no different train and

1032
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,210
application and<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone an application on</font>

1033
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,288
desktop let me get right down to it

1034
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,520
local storage review<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you want to</font>

1035
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:41,500
leave you with sword<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the device by</font>

1036
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,390
the application on the easiest way to do

1037
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> load it up in the simulator</font>

1038
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:48,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">attach instruments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that process ID and</font>

1039
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,529
then start watching where rights to the

1040
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:52,359
desk very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy it shows you every</font>

1041
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:54,279
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data is being written in</font>

1042
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere it's being read from it's a</font>

1043
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:58,240
very easy way to get a comprehensive

1044
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,819
view of all the information another way

1045
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a source code review that's</font>

1046
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:05,619
also again very easy if you can read

1047
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,059
objective-c it's just a question of what

1048
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:10,059
you have access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sort of level you</font>

1049
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:12,069
have access to you for the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1050
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:14,289
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should point out that for the</font>

1051
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:17,170
simulator when you want to do a similar

1052
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:18,309
to test let's say you are working with a

1053
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,569
vendor who's created an iphone

1054
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:21,279
application for you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

1055
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:23,069
test of it they're unwilling to give you

1056
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">this first code for a variety of reasons</font>

1057
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:28,599
but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the compiled simulated</font>

1058
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,459
build so when they built in<font color="#CCCCCC"> xcode to</font>

1059
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,720
test it on a simulator it creates a

1060
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">little folder and the iphone simulator</font>

1061
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,598
they can zip that up and send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

1062
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,430
you drop it into your simulator folder

1063
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,829
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app is automatically installed</font>

1064
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,538
there's not a very complex process to it

1065
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:43,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">but at that point you have a compiled</font>

1066
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:44,260
binary it's essentially the same as the

1067
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,250
binder that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone book</font>

1068
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> power for an Intel Architecture</font>

1069
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,140
versus our market

1070
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,940
sure so a vendor we should have any

1071
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,180
complaints<font color="#CCCCCC"> while providing that compiled</font>

1072
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,340
binary you want to review what's stored

1073
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,379
on the device by iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not only what</font>

1074
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,300
the application is storing but also the

1075
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,380
screenshots the autocomplete etc you

1076
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,550
want to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> autocomplete is</font>

1077
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,520
being turned off with appropriate text

1078
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:07,800
fields that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do in a</font>

1079
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,030
code review where you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> acts as the</font>

1080
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,320
binary can just go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

1081
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,390
typing things into all the text field

1082
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see what auto completes its very</font>

1083
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:18,270
easy way to see it keep it<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple review</font>

1084
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remove right so this is kind of I</font>

1085
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:22,410
think the overarching idea of security

1086
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,060
that we are going to keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as simple</font>

1087
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:26,279
as possible and then complexity add

1088
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,020
security problems if you can keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1089
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,760
simple if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can review to remove it</font>

1090
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:34,320
makes everyone's jobs a lot easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1091
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,780
so we also need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> educate puree</font>

1092
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,880
departments if you have one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever's</font>

1093
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,050
can be testing the application you don't

1094
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,250
want them just picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the iphone</font>

1095
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,680
typing in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single tech drop table no</font>

1096
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,000
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fun a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sequel injection</font>

you of setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that proxy environment</font>

00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:01,920
the different inputs that will go into

1102
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:04,410
it and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test those so local and</font>

1103
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,600
remote inputs user input from apps is

1104
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,339
always a concern right that's that's

1105
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,540
kind of a security 101 especially for

1106
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,110
web applications you don't want to trust

1107

ultimately it's going to be broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1137
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,069
somebody could hijack it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1138
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,799
checking that cell certificate you're

1139
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,060
gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad time and then finally</font>

1140
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,040
maintain the integrity of the device

1141
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,890
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to do to say the least</font>

1142
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,140
there are a variety of ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

1143
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">it there's things like MDM which is</font>

1145

<font color="#E5E5E5">before your application starts up</font>

1147
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,120
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways to do it there just</font>

1148
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,200
as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to defeat those checks so</font>

1149
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,549
the end result is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

1150
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,140
assuming that everyone talking to your

00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:43,670
server every app talking to your server

1152
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,290
is a rogue application information

1153
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,970
leakage you want to examine all traffic

1154
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,830
to and from the application like should

1155

be done with web applications a common

1156
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:53,180
thing I see is that people will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1157
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,380
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have this mobile banking site</font>

1158

let's go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make a mobile banking</font>

1159
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,650

take what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of those responses</font>

if that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it may be the</font>

too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> information to the iphone</font>

1167
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,430
somebody is able to intercept that

1168
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,020
traffic maybe they could use that extra

1169
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,509
information you're sending that you're

1170

1175
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:29,210
simple review to remove a good example

1176
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,609
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested a financial transfer</font>

1177
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:33,830
application on the iphone and they had

1178
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,810
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they wanted to be super</font>

1179
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:37,520
secure so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be super</font>

1180
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:39,560
secure is that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> only allow the</font>

1181
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,570
official iphone application to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1182
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,850
session ID from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server and the way</font>

1183
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,490
they enforce that is that they would do

1184
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,529
a they had a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> symmetric key on the</font>

1185
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:50,060
device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this metric key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also on the</font>

1186
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,040
server they would encrypt the timestamp

1187
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,779
of the symmetric key at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server got a</font>

1188
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,100
response or request for a session ID

1189
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,350
that didn't include the encrypted

1190
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,360
timestamp than they would deny it well a

1191
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,799
couple problems there right<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I've the</font>

1192
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,090
application was free to download in the

1193
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,710
App Store<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anybody in the entire world</font>

1194
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,630
can download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it free and get</font>

1195
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,700
a you know a valid session the other

1196
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,050
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secret key is</font>

1197
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">being stored in the binary you know we</font>

1198
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,089
talked before about how drm doesn't work

1199
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,180
because you have to have

1200
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:15,769
you have to have the encrypted content

1201
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:17,808
or similarly you have had the binary we

1202
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:19,848
ran the binary through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ida and we saw a</font>

1203
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,680
secret key function and that just had

1204
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:23,960
the secret key in plain text so it's

1205
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,160
very very obvious we ultimately

1206
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,319
recommended the client take it out

1207
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,399
because didn't add<font color="#CCCCCC"> any security and we</font>

1208
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:29,900
worried that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody had downloaded</font>

1209
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,599
the application and ran it through Ida

1210
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they saw such an obvious blunder</font>

1211
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,049
that they will then take extra effort to

1212
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:37,940
kind of find any extra holes that are in

1213
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:39,140
there so you know it's you want to make

1214
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:43,369
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you only have we absolutely</font>

1215
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,118
need in their secure coding and so now

1216
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:46,430
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to high-level</font>

1217
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,099
about some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found</font>

1218
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,029
the rude to these vulnerabilities

1219
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:52,039
however you know secure coding

1220
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:55,150
especially for the iOS could be an

1221
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire day or more of instruction but</font>

1222
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:59,150
you know who thought bubble that's what

1223
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,819
if those were gone I was kind of hoping

1224
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,819
they were but the back in style now app

1225
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:07,910
is bringing them back so you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1226
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:10,369
arbitrarily execute code loaded onto the

1227
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:13,969
device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this could bypass the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seat</font>

1228
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">belt if we do so how do we do it right</font>

1229
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know same concerns as MC will be</font>

1230
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:22,700
checking boundaries things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

1231
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:27,319
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to use appropriate functions</font>

1232
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,450
has anyone here heard of SG RL copy as

1233
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:32,299
opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> STR n copy one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person all</font>

1234
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:36,828
right um so you have to like check the

1235
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:38,809
Apple instructions and there's a link

1236
00:51:36,829 --> 00:51:40,670
down there to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> developer site where</font>

1237
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:42,769
you can see some of the recommended

1238
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">functions as far as how to do these</font>

1239
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:47,089
string operations securely but these

1240
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:49,640
improve upon already what's considered

1241
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:52,369
secure functions you wanna use properly

1242
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,920
can calculate buffer sizes so using

1243
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:56,569
constants and this includes integer

1244
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,559
bounds checking as well so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1245
00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:02,690
any integer overflows in for mastering

1246
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,890
poems again anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we hadn't see</font>

1247
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,650
we're probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on the iOS</font>

1248
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,950
device as well so you know I application

1249
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:12,499
displaces your input I fear known to do

1250
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:15,710
it uses some yellow in a strip string

1251
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:18,618
with format option you can use the

1252
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:20,329
printf function an attacker sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> y'all</font>

1253
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:22,160
percentage percentage percentage % us

1254
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:24,400
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello what do you think is</font>

1255
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,399
going to happen

1256
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">my craft when you attempt if he's as a</font>

1259
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:40,650
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing to you with that printf</font>

1260
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,419
vulnerabilities are very dangerous

1261
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're kind of deceptively dangerous</font>

1262
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:52,239
so how do you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right just like web</font>

1263
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,819
applications we're going to enforce the

1264
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,439
secure coding standard no vulnerable

1265
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:58,869
function should accept untrusted user

1266
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,859
input so when we have a shrimp format

1267
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:02,739
vulnerability it's usually we have

1268
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:04,900
printf friend and then the variable and

1269
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:06,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">then a paren like printf you know</font>

1270
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,499
argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and that's where we get</font>

1271
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">into trouble however if we properly</font>

1272
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:17,948
format it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reference the variables</font>

1273
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:19,769
then it's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

1274
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of something that did go wrong</font>

1275
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:26,529
this was an application we tested and a

1276
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:29,439
couple things it was doing that wasn't

1277
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:31,959
immediately obvious from the perspective

1278
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:32,920
of our application pen test so this for

1279
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,169
things that are happening on the server

1280
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,180
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of explained the issues that</font>

1281
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,189
we had so one thing it did is that he

1282
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,890
manages the state using the device ID

1283
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:43,959
not the session ID so the session ID was

1284
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,839
being passed back and forth but on the

1285
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:49,899
server it would accept the device ID as

1286
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:51,400
a session the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is that the</font>

1287
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,160
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not terminated properly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1288
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,109
the server side so when you click logout

1289
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,420
the server continue to exist<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

1290
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:59,619
continue to exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the server side so</font>

1291
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:02,469
this led to a very interesting

1292
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:04,619
vulnerability the following<font color="#CCCCCC"> conditions</font>

1293
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:06,579
were met we can go back actually sorry

1294
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:09,099
fine finishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually look</font>

1295
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:10,630
into the application once it logged into

1296
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:13,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application at some point in the</font>

1297
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:15,309
last day something<font color="#E5E5E5"> they logged out the</font>

1298
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:16,809
attacker then tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to log in again the</font>

1299
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:20,140
attacker supplies the wrong credentials

1300
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:24,400
through the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> application and then</font>

1301
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:26,859
they application then requests a session

1302
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,049
state update or refresh while<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting</font>

1303
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:31,328
for the incorrect login to be sent so

1304
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:33,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scared logs into the</font>

1305
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:36,819
application he used his<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone in a bar</font>

1306
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:40,719
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pick it up I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh and try to</font>

1307
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the incorrect credentials and</font>

1308
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,949
the server says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me check these</font>

1309
00:54:43,299 --> 00:54:47,229
credentials against the authentication

1310
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:48,579
database the other server is waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1311
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:49,640
make that check to get the response back

1312
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:51,829
from the database

1313
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,470
the iphone application then said go

1314
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:56,599
ahead and refresh my session for me the

1315
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:58,009
application server would then say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1316
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:00,559
refresh the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't</font>

1317
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:02,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything for this jsessionid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

1318
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:03,920
session ID was but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have something</font>

1319
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:05,329
for your device ID and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this must be</font>

1320
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,160
your active session so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font>

1321
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:08,720
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and log you in at this active</font>

1322
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,549
session later on the authentication

1323
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">server would say no it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1324
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:14,119
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm go by then it's too late and</font>

1325
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:18,309
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application has walled you into the</font>

1326
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:21,019
server so it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font>

1327
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:21,799
interesting bug to find because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1328
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:23,299
one of the first things you're doing

1329
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,579
testing eyes on applications try to

1330
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:27,559
bypass the authentication so we did this

1331
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:29,839
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application brand new install</font>

1332
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:32,059
tried to bypass with medication no luck

1333
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better loan and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

1334
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:35,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later on we went back and tested it</font>

1335
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:37,549
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now really would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have bypass</font>

1336
00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:39,019
authentication and so that was difficult

1337
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:40,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find out what we end up doing if you</font>

1338
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:41,479
had to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of people together</font>

1339
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:43,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they looked at all the different</font>

1340
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,630
logs on the servers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see where it's</font>

1341
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,359
being done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these requests and it</font>

1342
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,730
ended up being that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the silver is</font>

1343
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,319
using device ID which the application

1344
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,619
developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> claimed not to be aware of</font>

1345
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:57,920
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flava suspect and are able to</font>

1346
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:59,869
compromise the session that way so how

1347
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,450
do you do it right we have strong server

1348
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:03,829
side controls over access policy

1349
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforcement on current concurrent logins</font>

1350
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:07,759
so if somebody walks<font color="#E5E5E5"> in again with the</font>

1351
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:10,730
same session ID the other one should be

1352
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">logged out do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not maintain a session ID</font>

1353
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:16,779
by the device ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> an iOS 5 actually the</font>

1354
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:19,190
udid universal device ID is gone away

1355
00:56:16,779 --> 00:56:21,710
but the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the device ID is</font>

1356
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,690
that everyone says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here is a device</font>

1357
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:26,299
ID those unique to each phone I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will use</font>

1358
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:27,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">this to track my users right and it</font>

1359
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:29,720
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be secret and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it ends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up being</font>

1360
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent over than that we're complain text</font>

1361
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:37,189
to a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications and games</font>

1362
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:39,259
and it's it's bad you know it's obvious

1363
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:42,079
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go wrong with servers you</font>

1364
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:44,859
know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about everything just like a</font>

1365
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,170
client-server application make sure it's

1366
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:51,828
protected so hard in the server same guy

1367
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:53,000
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zizzo lost for that push</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">notifications isn't my research my</font>

1369
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,769
friend attachment Johnny smart guy this

1370
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:58,250
website check it out found that in order

1371
00:56:57,769 --> 00:57:00,410
to push

1372
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:02,780
indications on iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple issues of</font>

public and private certificate you sign

1374
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,820
the push update with the private

1375
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,320
certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed the Apple and they</font>

1376
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:11,480
verify and then send it out to all your

1377
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,010
devices a lot of elvers don't understand

1378
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,050
what a private<font color="#CCCCCC"> and public certificate is</font>

1379
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,400
and so as a result they publish it on

1380
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,810
their website so anybody can go look for

1381
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,340
this you find the website you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can push</font>

1382
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:22,480
notification to any application you want

1383
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:27,170
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of a basic security fail</font>

1384
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,570
nsurl iOS is secured by default for SSL

1385
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:33,230
connections the problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1386
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:35,360
then circumvent that method in order to

1387
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:37,280
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and more easily test you the</font>

1388
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,040
rights in the simulator that can cause

1389
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:44,180
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems we saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that in paypal</font>

1390
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:45,590
where people were they took out that ssl

1391
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,210
check and I kind of came back and bit

1392
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:48,680
them in the bath so to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

1393
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,720
when you go from a simulated environment

1394
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,710
to actual production environment that

1395
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're actually checking ssl</font>

1396
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:57,050
certificates so review and so we went

1397
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,430
over the basics you know motivations of

1398
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:00,440
attackers you know what they're gonna go

1399
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:02,629
after on the device how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up for</font>

1400
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,890
testing and look for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

1401
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,290
know tighten our secure storage of data

1402
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:08,150
and the credentials the inadvertent

1403
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:10,220
little storage that the operating system

1404
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,140
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do on its own time now</font>

1405
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,230
client-side temptation if you didn't

1406
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:16,970
catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or it's bad secure coding</font>

1407
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:19,370
practices just the beginning that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

1408
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:22,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know start to build on that push</font>

1409
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:23,359
notifications<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know your things that</font>

1410
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:24,890
you might not think about so we make

1411
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,610
sure that operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> is deploying it</font>

1412
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:31,069
securely as well the end result is a

1413
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:33,290
testing is easy both for you in for them

1414
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,970
than being attackers securities hard

1415
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just for you we get to secure</font>

1416
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,390
every possible entry point<font color="#E5E5E5"> attackers</font>

1417
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,910
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that I find one bug and they can</font>

1418
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,770
