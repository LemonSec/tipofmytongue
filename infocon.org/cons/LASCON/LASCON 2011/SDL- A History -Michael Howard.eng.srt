27
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:40,530
so well as subtle isn't it

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,729
I guess we're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit microsoft i</font>

longest time was always things like SIDS

33
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,280
and privileges and ackles and crypto and

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,490
permissions and user tokens and desktop

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,500
tokens and all that sort of crud and

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,530
then a bit of us decided to focus on

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,060
security as in threats and that's really

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we evolved was the current group and</font>

50
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,390
don't tell a wife that way because

51

she'll just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the proceeds</font>

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,179
so yeah um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be used to wear it</font>

really that's that simple in fact anyone

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,560
appoint a wsdl is that we will remove

94
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:38,099
things from stl if they're no longer

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,720

principles a big believer<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss</font>

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,880
prescriptive yet practical again this

98
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,070
really boils down to if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,349
practical if it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work then</font>

100
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:51,810
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't bother if it's not practical</font>

101
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,370
in other words it is just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bitch</font>

102
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,840
and moan about something being bad

103
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,660
coding practice but not have a good

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,190
solution it's no bearing in the SDR you

105
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,440
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell people that's just</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad you go so that's</font>

really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and here's a great</font>

108

go through a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code you</font>

the code is crap where our<font color="#E5E5E5"> test as a</font>

crap but relationship you probably have

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,750
better quality code well the biggest

140
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,180
indicator that we've found<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a number</font>

forward is to come mr. analyze current

yet and come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ways of mitigating</font>

again it seems pretty

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,970
keep doing this Ashley because I this

176
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,259
this stuff I'm like surfers are involved

177
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,830
in security we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very very busy</font>

178
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:03,740
since the earliest days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Windows NT</font>

179
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,969
with Common Criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> evaluations and so</font>

180
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,819
it's always been sort of a security

181
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:12,590
focus so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this adoption of</font>

182
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,960
security and power groups prior to SD

183
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,270
other was very very uneven some<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

184
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,150
so got religion a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a lot</font>

185
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,370
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than other groups I'll be frank</font>

186
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,280
I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people would back me up</font>

187
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,919
on this one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most software</font>

188
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,669
vendors and we still see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this today only</font>

189
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,130
start to really focus a lot on pure

190
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:37,010
software security when their customers

191
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,630
start complaining customers ain't

192
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,669
complaining just keep givin just keep

193
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,519
spoon-feeding the customers right that's

194
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,990
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and so the customers start</font>

195
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,029
complaining said we need you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve</font>

196
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">your game they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to prove the</font>

197
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,040
game it's pretty rare I've seen some

198
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:54,020
companies do it I already done it

199
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,610
without customers complaining but it's

200
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:02,569
pretty rare unfortunately so back in the

201
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,270
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days it was pretty spotting some</font>

202
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:11,779
point of use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better than others then</font>

203
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:13,550
the whole it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was pretty ragged Vanessa</font>

204
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,470
before the nights over Richard software

205
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,910
security but it feels like you know

206
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,700
privileges and<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain tackles and</font>

207
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,310
tokens and firewall crypto<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot sort of</font>

208
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,370
stuff well also<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the windows 2007</font>

209
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:29,029
frame just before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look 2000 ship this</font>

210
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,480
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when our group started to grow and so</font>

211
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:36,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an acceptably learned some of it</font>

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:42,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was really uneven and we know when</font>

214
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,540
those two thousand was like right we can

215
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,550
possibly from a security standpoint know

216
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,620
the crazy thing is that the listed

217
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,560
thousand was<font color="#CCCCCC"> chock-full of security</font>

221
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:07,219
ipsec it had those security technologies

222
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,830
therefore it was secure that it had many

223
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,890
many security vulnerabilities and spell

224
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,720
it years old adage right just bolting on

225
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,209

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why you're our group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is started</font>

228
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,029
focusing on security as in threats not

232
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,540
internally called the threats to our

235
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:44,390
is really is looking at one out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

236
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,040
threats to the products there's a mean

237
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,140
to have a province under threat on the

238
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,390
risk of attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we send a sort</font>

239
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:55,610
of codifying the methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack and</font>

240
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:58,069
it is very rough there's very inventive

<font color="#CCCCCC">signal stripe spiritually maybe attacker</font>

information disclosure denial of service

244
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,720
an elevation of privilege then give CIA

245
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,160
30 more fine-grained and looking from

246
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,140
attackers perspective as opposed to a

247
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,110
defenders perspective that's essentially

248
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,910
what stride was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the joke by the way is</font>

249
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason about repudiation in</font>

250
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:24,949
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other wise it would be</font>

diets which<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing quite you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

252
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:31,070
same thing um we also embed this Utley

253
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,240
the universal bug bar this I think is

254
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,709
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important if you ever</font>

255
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,950
did which was coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the concept</font>

256
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:39,020
of critical important moderate and low

257
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,930
severity vulnerabilities because Noel

258
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,319
bugs are alike a buffalo when people

259
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:48,050
hear the word buffer overrun and really

260
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:52,070
scared the thing is you can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

261
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,890
code and all right over there some code

262
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,010
that I wrote when I was 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old and</font>

263
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:01,699
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30,000 lines of sea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

264
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:05,480
it's completely secure completely secure

265
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,900
is the code great quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> C code it's</font>

266
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,889
not bad it has both all<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs in it it</font>

267
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,629
does

268
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,549
but the crazy thing is completely secure

269
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,989
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not networked it doesn't</font>

270
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:18,799
let me Mellon<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 privileges literally</font>

271
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:22,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunkie at all so dumb game that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

272
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool guy eventually but and then it's</font>

273
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,540
funny because it's completely secure

274
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,480
because it's absolutely isolated the

275
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,829
worst he can do is attack yourself which

276
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:37,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">is hardly exciting so the big bug bar it</font>

277
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:39,579
was our first look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how do we define</font>

278
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:43,549
the severity of a security vulnerability

279
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:45,290
and we also started recording else's I

280
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:47,389
am a massive believing root cause

281
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,919
analysis and we will continue to do this

282
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:55,009
to this day why did we make that mistake

283
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:59,089
what happened and so what we do is that

you know classic buffer overrun or

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,920
integer arithmetic kind of issues

314
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:41,849
there's a very new mating weaknesses but

315
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,709
I'm a huge believer in doing repos

analysis if you will not do it cause

317
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,640
analysis of bugs that you are fighting

318
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,130
either within your own organizations or

319
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,650

321
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:57,660
frankly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't understand the bugs</font>

that you are that you're creating you

go through this whole series<font color="#CCCCCC"> of events</font>

352
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,180
in a bit more detail shortly but

353
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:31,160
essentially what it was was date saying

354
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay with outside the security and</font>

now bills memos are very very rare so

358
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,180
hurt them to put this out was a big was

359
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,560
a big deal I mean basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave our</font>

we have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> oak with a bed net security</font>

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,030
personal ethical to done that security

stand down a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little i was called that</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really fascinating because</font>

368
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,069
paradise think we've done that but a

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,740
girl from have been built from the

370
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,659
ground up with security in mind how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

374
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:27,860
for security in mind we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went about its</font>

375
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,200
around october two thousand one with

00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:35,090
files and security box than with other

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,620
framework so that sucks because here we

378
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,320
have this theorem is built into the

such thing back then without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a permit</font>

383
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:55,060
because we don't care there was no

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:59,570
legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave their security box right</font>

385
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,730
okay what do we do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love babies</font>

387
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,740
is the bugs you currently finding so

388
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,600
that while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't ship this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">really gutsy move there's a team side</font>

rated basically flat lines which is

406
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">fascinating because we're shipping in</font>

407
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,070
February the whole thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our stop in</font>

408
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,630
mid-november and go as long as it had to

409
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,010
go until<font color="#CCCCCC"> the incoming bug right flatline</font>

410
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,410
obviously have no idea what that they

of making changes this late in the game

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:52,220
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did do which is where</font>

ever done so back then how did have you

432
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:07,490
use asp.net before version 1 by the beta

433
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:11,480
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're lucky because back</font>

434
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:18,050
then in the beta asp.net I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding</font>

471
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,860
the field version then shipped the crazy

absolutely right decisions made we also

480
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:42,659
added a new marriage code attribute I've

481
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,639
called a lot of policies allow party

<font color="#E5E5E5">trust of callers attribute which</font>

483
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,270
basically took a bunch of code and said

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh I allow basically untrusted code to</font>

485
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,600
call me and by default we would know

486
00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:00,210
where untrusted code to call sir managed

487
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,350
code assemblies so each<font color="#E5E5E5"> we reduce the</font>

attack surface of the dotnet framework

and their speed on that substantially

their design changes which is exactly

most of cold code was all like web

00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:37,660
play the WMDs and what will have you

570
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,580
know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would love to kill it back</font>

compatibility but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just Carly</font>

572
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,449
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem we faced in Windows now</font>

573
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,629
this we actually started rivet and

574
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,600
Senate drive your first threat modeling

575
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,240
it was really kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

576
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,209
their money to him I'll be free<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote</font>

577
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,370
as an experiment in writing client-side

578
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:02,170
JavaScript<font color="#CCCCCC"> let sucked and that's why the</font>

579
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,510
early days people hated threat moment

580
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,550
Microsoft is oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my fault and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tree</font>

581
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:09,879
was cracked absolutely ridiculously

582
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:12,970
impossible to use it was my first foray

583
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:18,040
into using javascript on the client yeah

584
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:19,780
let me do it again there's a bit of a

585
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,810
mess of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bates of no confidence in my</font>

586
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,160
JavaScript skills back then there's feel

587
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,260
pretty good pretty good thing about you

588
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,580
guys well they understand JavaScript as

589
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,760
it stands today anyway and easily also

590
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:35,409
started first even people I'm prefix

591
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving people bug reports they get here</font>

592
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,720
ladies bugs in your code now look in

593
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:43,330
triage them and fix them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's how</font>

594
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,910
to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by then stay running desktop</font>

595
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:49,389
analysis pre fast that will introduce

596
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:53,460
that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically just a bit</font>

597
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:55,480
essentially into a trap procedural

598
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,560
static analysis as opposed to

599
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,210
interprocedural which your prefixes you

600
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,700
can't run prefix on the desktop it's

601
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too big Baylor you're way too big</font>

602
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,540
and it's just unwieldly when we do nun

603
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,850
prefix centrally as a personal middle as

604
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,840
desktop we also added this thing called

605
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,459
security order we change the choice

606
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,620
known to the final security<font color="#E5E5E5"> review</font>

607
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,180
because bank has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been like like is using</font>

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:23,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word order and they're obvious</font>

609
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,900
reasons it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some implications the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">joined the f sr or the security order</font>

611
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,470
back then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

612
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,950
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are secure is to make sure that you</font>

are complying with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdl that's it</font>

614
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,460
that's where for we make sure you've

615
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,350
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the right things when give you</font>

616
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:44,160
a tip at the end a man a perfect

617
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,299
find us by nothing during<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pensar</font>

618
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,980
but on planet earth there's always

619
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:52,570
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially for the bigger</font>

620
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:56,679
products and the limited form<font color="#E5E5E5"> however is</font>

621
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:59,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that how they push a security push well</font>

622
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,140
beneficial is not scalable it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

623
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:03,340
you can't write stuff the right before

624
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,200
your ship let's go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

625
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,480
security bugs and fix them you just

626
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,590
can't do that it really it really does

627
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:16,590
not work and so this area started

628
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:20,020
talking to the leadership<font color="#E5E5E5"> team about</font>

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,879
changing the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> now changing the</font>

630
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,379
way we build software microsoft and they

631
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,490
didn't have three options option<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

goes away yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the second was</font>

634
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,690
totally without our current available

ship software that's what we do it but

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything about shipping software</font>

642

that's it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a process that</font>

actually we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on time but we</font>

get shot big do yourself a deal there's

nowhere we could jeopardize that the

650
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:18,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna say 129 such requirements it's in</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballpark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from version</font>

to version but it is over 100 that we

00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:29,169
have 100 requirements and there's a

654

surface how much code and functionality

658
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:43,750
will expose to interested users and so

659
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:49,690
these are building tools around

660
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,730
measuring it as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a 2004 is where</font>

you're going to realize back then we had

no es a lot address space layout

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really closely with the developer</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CPP you get all these on by default</font>

this is no fiction as you can get

nothing changed except the editor

you know those two values at I outside

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the hip right the buffer is that big</font>

00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:08,940
well the compiler is no clue also uses a
