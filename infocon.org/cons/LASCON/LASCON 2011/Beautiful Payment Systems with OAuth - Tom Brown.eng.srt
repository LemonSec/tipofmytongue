1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:21,749
developed a viet code for federated and

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,839
delegated identity several open source

3
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:28,049
product projects as here's Tom with the

weather on<font color="#E5E5E5"> github prior Tom develop</font>

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,300
network and security code for companies

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:39,120
including V extreme Microsoft<font color="#CCCCCC"> yoli full</font>

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,919
security and biometric access<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good</font>

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,989
afternoon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope everyone had a good</font>

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
lunch and I hope everybody's in the

10
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">right room i'm excited that so many</font>

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,000
people showed up because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,699
like the wild card session<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm</font>

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,469
not a security expert or why they hacked

14
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,649
or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just stabbed a ruby</font>

15
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,379
developer who participates and identity

16
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,050
workshops that are twice a year in the

17
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,020
mountain view and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about user</font>

18
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,380
centric identity which is instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,000
letting companies dictate what the terms

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,460
are with identity systems we focus on

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,140
user rights and letting the user keep

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,520
control of the data and things like that

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's identity work that that</font>

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,590
isn't aim for that kind of goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it</font>

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:35,008
doesn't fit in at identity workshop so

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,590
let's get started I'm Tom here's Tom

27
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:43,170
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weather is my kind of moniker</font>

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:46,020
and a run-through well be talking about

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,500
today I'm gonna kind of start out with

30
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,449
the motivation it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'll speak a</font>

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,670
little bit sputtering or maybe actually

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">over bring this down a bit</font>

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,250
there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> that better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the first</font>

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,860
thing we'll do is just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:11,790
motivations why do we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read redo</font>

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:16,530
payments on the web and then to kick us

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,019
off I'll do a quick code sample just to

38
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,530
show how easy it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a web</font>

39
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,599
payment using OAuth today in dollars so

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,170
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> all actually be moving my money</font>

41
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:35,220
from a a big bank into my local credit

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,768
union using OAuth and then then we'll

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,180
take a step back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at a walk one</font>

44
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:46,260
versus oauth2<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk about a merging</font>

45
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,540
protocol called open transact which we

46
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,470
did our first draft at the identity

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,920
workshop last week and then its

48
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,920
relationship to open ID connect open

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,429
transact doesn't require open ID connect

50
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:06,780
but open ID connect is a very good fit

51
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,840
for it as an extension and then talk

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,209
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of future things that we're</font>

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on or would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the motivation is articulated</font>

55
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,989
really well<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a book called beautiful</font>

56
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,840
security there's a chapter<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a dulles</font>

57
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,850
called rethinking ecommerce<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he said</font>

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the way we do payments on the</font>

59
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,519
web today is totally insane why are we

60
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,359
using these shared secret credit card

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,620
numbers they're so vulnerable because

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,660
you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifetime of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font>

63
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,940
card number it passes through a thousand

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,850
people's hands and you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea who's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit card</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

66
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,530
and you know every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,780
conversation with somebody who had to

68
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,520
you know they got a email from their

69
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,980
bank so you know we have suspicious

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,800
activity on your account and it's kind

71
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,489
of a real pain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of my favorite</font>

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,960
restaurants only take cash because it's

73
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,430
for compliance they don't want to go

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,620
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the hassle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> credit cards and</font>

75
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,340
stuff and so credit cards or real pain

76
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,858
in the butt so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure its secrets are</font>

77
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,530
bad and people who are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

78
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:28,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">business get the wrong in the deal</font>

79
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:32,369
because the banking darknet imposes

80
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:37,140
unnecessary responsibilities on them

81
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:40,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do so one</font>

82
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,370
a kind of bright spot of hope and I'm

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,080
not affiliated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwolla in any way</font>

84
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:51,590
although they're the first ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,240
saw that support OAuth<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 payments they</font>

86
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">my under saying is that they do like a</font>

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,440
million dollars of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transactions a day</font>

88
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:04,880
they're very new growing I think half of

89
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:12,120
their transfers are Bitcoin exchanges so

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,950
for as far as their volume in a walk we

91
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,510
have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like this mantra that's</font>

92
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,390
emerged somehow to like make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it simpler</font>

93
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,590
to digest for newcomers which is there's

94
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,650
two steps that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about getting a</font>

95
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,770
token which is the authorization process

96
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,810
and then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a token and in the slide</font>

97
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">person dictation it's very heavily</font>

98
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,570
linked ified so all these blue text you

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,259
can link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that these particular</font>

100
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:49,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones are links to dois documentation so</font>

101
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:51,810
when you actually before I do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwolla</font>

102
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,539
thing just kind of like a raise of hands

103
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,970
is there anyone who has no idea what o.o

104
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">fizz and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and would like me to just go</font>

105
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:06,690
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example okay so let's do this</font>

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,750
just to get our settings here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

107
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,360
was the company that gave oh off the

108
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:17,100
credibility it has with OAuth version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

109
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,960
because they deployed it in 2009 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

110
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,539
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party applications to do kind</font>

111
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,349
of this authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing but</font>

112
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:31,919
lets them use the Twitter API and so for

113
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:34,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">instances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see here I've used</font>

114
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,740
other web applications that have asked

115
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:41,039
me for my Twitter stuff so these are all

116
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the applications that I've trusted and</font>

117
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,949
at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I can revoke the token that</font>

118
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,560
Twitter gave them when I when I asked

119
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,539
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so what like one of my favorite</font>

120
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:57,449
is a the earthquake command line client

121
00:06:53,539 --> 00:07:00,810
for Twitter it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a ruby gem and</font>

122
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:08,130
so like here it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> right here let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

123
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:11,699
if I can so that's the beauty of oooff

124
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,889
is that it lets these ecosystems emerge

125
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,050
where if the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> website Twitter</font>

126
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,659
website isn't solving a problem then

127
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,550
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party application can do</font>

128
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:22,169
stuff like threaded conversations or in

129
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,139
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if somebody gets</font>

130
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,448
chatty and I don't want to hear from

131
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">them anymore I can just say Marcus</font>

132
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:33,030
exclude you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie Sheen and I'll</font>

133
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,820
no longer get tweets from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlie Sheen</font>

134
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,659
so that's the beautiful thing about

135
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:41,729
OAuth is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new innovation that</font>

136
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:54,680
occurs around a website

137
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:59,938
so that to the ebb there's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> station so</font>

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,879
similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwolla has this authorization</font>

139
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:07,349
of get a token step as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go through</font>

140
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,870
and and there's this notion of scopes

141
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:12,870
and oh off and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

142
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,490
unfortunately named term a better term

143
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,770
would be capabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> because scopes</font>

144
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,529
kind of makes you think of only like

145
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:23,490
read-only access you know is am I

146
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:25,649
accessing you know Google YouTube vs

147
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,770
google calendar that kind of thing I

148
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:32,339
think capability is a better term than

149
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,679
scope and especially in banking because

150
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,669
you're doing active stuff like you're

151
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">making a payment so when when Dwolla or</font>

152
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:46,350
any other banking Oh auth application

153
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:49,920
asks for permissions or you know to get

154
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,920
a token and this would be this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,709
a third party application using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwolla</font>

156
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,380
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a third-party application</font>

157
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,050
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dualla for these I'll call them</font>

158
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,880
capabilities instead of scopes and you

159
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:07,439
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one there's send money</font>

160
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,019
and so when it asks for the token it

161
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:17,459
specifies exactly what scopes or

162
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:20,010
capabilities so I've already a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clio to</font>

163
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,349
token with a send money scope for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwolla</font>

164
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,449
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what I'm going to do is run a</font>

165
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,040
little ruby program to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a payment to</font>

166
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:28,040
show that it works

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:43,949
this up this set sample code is in that

168
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:49,800
github link i had at the front that this

169
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:52,350
presentation is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> lap con oo oo oo oo</font>

170
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,310
KU calm and that link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the github</font>

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:10:00,960
where you can find this sample code<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

172
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:24,209
and it's a guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just go actually</font>

173
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:37,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what how's that hey okay that</font>

174
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:44,340
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we good idea that i'll just</font>

175
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:47,940
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about okay um so anyway I think ok</font>

176
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,230
so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steps just a document</font>

177
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:57,540
them that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do I'm going to</font>

178
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:59,040
fetch the ruby program I this you know

179
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step is get a token this is</font>

180
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,390
the token I got and I'm going to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

181
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:10,980
an environment variable so that it's not

182
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:16,130
gonna go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just right off of you</font>

183
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's good idea</font>
