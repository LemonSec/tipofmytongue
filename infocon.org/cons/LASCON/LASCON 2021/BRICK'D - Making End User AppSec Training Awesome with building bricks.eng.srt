1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,560
all right we're all able to go grab your

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,480
lunch at least a little bit

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
because i know this is right after that

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,080
lunch time and so i want to be

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
respectful to all the technical folks

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,199
coming back towards me

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,160
after me because this is going to be

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
filled with a lot more humor and it's

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
going to be connecting with your end

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,480
users i found this approach very

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,120
effective working with

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,239
various owasp chapters as well as

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,200
the

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
houston java user group and some other

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
java groups so

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
does somebody know do we want to go

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,160
ahead and start the recording now or are

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,440
we already going

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
okay

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
do you understand that yeah so

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
like i said

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
yeah go ahead go ahead sorry

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
sorry i will no yeah that's fine

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,119
but

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,880
anyway i think you've met joseph already

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,240
and he's going to present on britt and

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
clearly from it you know it's going to

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
be an entertaining session but before

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
that as a thank you for being speaker

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,840
i'd like to present you with this

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,080
oh thank you oh cool

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
all right

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
thanks

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
let me put this over here before i lose

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,759
it

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,439
all right so

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
this should get you perked up for the

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,960
rest of the sessions

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,759
if you're not in a comedic mood i

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,439
apologize you're probably going to get

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,880
there as well as maybe get envious of

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,040
some of your family and friends and your

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
kids so keep your money in your wallet

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
and wait a moment before you go out and

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159
make the big purchases

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
because you could spend a lot of money

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,159
very quickly so just a quick about me

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,920
going way way back started working with

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
atari basic i don't need to go through

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,878
all of that

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
these are all my own photos

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
i'm not a professional photographer so

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,319
you're going to see some lighting and

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,720
maybe some framing errors in there

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
if you want to get any of this for your

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,440
owass chapter just reach out to me i am

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480

if you want to get

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,319
engaged with us and help us spread that

65
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
message and get those students into a

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
better career path

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
right and like i said if you ever want

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,319
to collaborate

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,560
i've got so many ideas running in my

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,680
head about

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,160
stories that i can tell and there

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
there's my personal email joseph at

73
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
apmrast.com

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,400
now i just went through and

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,480
grabbed a number of those domains when i

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
got hit by layoffs yesterday and please

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,959
please

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
don't fall victim

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
to what the standard media does

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
in all of their messages

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,120
don't use the hacker hoodie there's so

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
much better

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,319
examples

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,959
leave the hoodies to esports

85
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
professionals

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,480
this is going to be one of the few

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
slides where actually have animation so

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
are you a builder

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,679
are you a breaker

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,239
you know because you always got to have

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,560
that argument there or are you a

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,159
defender and yes that is an actual piece

93
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
and you can play games if you know how

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
to use that so contact me afterwards if

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
you want to see that

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
this goal

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,239
is to basically bridge the gap

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
between your different teams

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
if you can get them thinking in a

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
different way that's not dry

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
and boring

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
you can also go through and make it a

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
little bit easier there

104
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,640
i can come up with so many different uh

105
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,799
acronyms for developers and so many

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,760
different

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,439
uh

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
just starting points but functional

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
resilient extensible secure healthy you

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
could go with fast

111
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,639
you could do

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,120
you know any number of things in there

113
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
this is just that high level how do you

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,840
go through and set the framework and get

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
things going

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
the best thing you can do to help all

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
your development teams

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
is leverage the owasp resources and now

119
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,280
they've got obasa's cornucopia so you

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
could go through and play some games in

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
there but everybody's going to need that

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
instruction manual sometimes it'll just

123
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,639
be enough to do your daily work

124
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,240
other times you've got to navigate

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
through all those mountains

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
now here

127
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
you know you got shakespeare to build or

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
not to build

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,360
that's not the question because if we

130
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,919
don't build our security plans our

131
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
policies and build those relationships

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
with our team members

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,759
we're going to be looking at hamlet

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,320
and saying poor europe i knew him well

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
and then you're going to be saying

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,560
i knew my company well but now

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
it's been taken over now there is also

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,320
like just a quick reminder a wasp top 10

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,840
and for the 24 you know you got to have

140
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
something for your application team to

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
look forward to

142
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
all right

143
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,360
this is what i feel is a good clear

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,000
representation

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
of some of the new

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,759
owasp top 10 references they might not

147
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
100 align with what you're thinking

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
about

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
but for this one

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
you've got the standard space man

151
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
and we're all familiar with this you can

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
see there's the new logo there's the

153
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,520
worn out one we'll come back to

154
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,199
some of those known vulnerable

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
components there but you might not think

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
of your partners

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
causing you an impact because i come

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,560
from both that performance and the

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,600
security perspective but over here this

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,919
could be one of your unconstrained

161
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,919
partners who isn't fully versed on best

162
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
practices for interacting with your api

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
so that's why this one is shooting at

164
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
you now back there maybe your partners

165
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,039
aren't trained and you're getting into

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,280
that yellow zone because you always have

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
to be aware

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
of working with that application team if

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,080
you go down to the performance language

170
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
you're going to get a lot more buy-in

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
than just simply talking about

172
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
security because they want to make sure

173
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
that their partners their customers can

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
actually have those requests fulfilled

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
then back there you know you got your

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
standard bots

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
also have some automated scanners

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
that are going through and trying to

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,560
figure out exactly what you have

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
and then your

181
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,280
user account takeover

182
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
where you might be bombarded by all of

183
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,919
those credential stuffing

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,039
the cryptographic failures did mention

185
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,080
about your data at rest and in transit

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,039
and protecting it accordingly so we all

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,199
know that medical

188
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,520
data especially for our children is

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,319
extremely valuable before they've even

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,199
got that full credit rating so on here i

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,360
just wanted to bring up a couple of

192
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
things with wait a minute i thought my

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
data was safe in the cloud and then down

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
here old man yells at cloud so kind of

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
reinforcing

196
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
that a little bit uh

197
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,520
and you know where's my data not where

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,479
is my pants

199
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,520
sql

200
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
command line

201
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,400
unfortunately injection has been there

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
time and time and time again

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,160
reason why i chose the vampires and with

204
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
his coffin in the back because

205
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
injection seems like it's coming up from

206
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
the dead time and time again you know it

207
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,919
seems like there's not a day that goes

208
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
by and when they have that injection

209
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
they can then suck the life out of our

210
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
data and basically leave us

211
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
exactly where we don't want to be uh you

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
know it's not a cup of java but it does

213
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
have the c column backslash you know i

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
couldn't find anything with slash bin

215
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
bash but you know

216
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
you have to go with what's most

217
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,800
vulnerable and what you can get in those

218
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
sets

219
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
you know kind of mix it up a little bit

220
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,919
but when you're talking about injection

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,719
these days please do not use any

222
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
veterinarians or medical professionals

223
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,919
regardless of where you are on that

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
spectrum let's just be respectful of

225
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,399
those so that's why over the years i've

226
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
changed it

227
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
some on these slides here

228
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,720
the insecure design

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
this is one of the newer ones

230
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,279
for the top 10 the way that they've

231
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
changed it around

232
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,720
and it's not just an overall

233
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
like just stop gap kind of bucket for

234
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
everything else

235
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
but it comes back to more of that

236
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,839
methodology

237
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
developers never want to have poor code

238
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
they always want to be able to give

239
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,800
their customers exactly what they need

240
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
so we need to honor and celebrate their

241
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
accomplishments and the good that they

242
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,399
do

243
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
for example you may have the halloween

244
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,760
king and he can do everything right in

245
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,560
his town and he's able to accomplish all

246
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,000
of his objectives but then one day

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
he's starting to take a look

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,000
at that new programming language or that

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
new module goes oh shiny let me go into

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,480
that path

251
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,120
we all know what happens then

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,880
ah he spoils the next

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,200
holiday so you got to make sure that

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
your developers

255
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
are celebrated for what's good but also

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
kind of pull them back and sometimes

257
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
it's more of the product managers that

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
you have to pull back

259
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,000
so right here you know

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
he's gone through and now he's a part of

261
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
the christmas holiday but he has to be

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
reminded this is the way back to secure

263
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,360
code

264
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
so if you're not

265
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,760
familiar with all the pof reference

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,480
references just come see me later on and

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,279
i can give you all that story

268
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
with your security configurations we all

269
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,360
know

270
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
that out of the box

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,760
things are wide open

272
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
how many default credentials are there

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
with admin admin admin password and all

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
it takes is a few quick steps to set

275
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
that up

276
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
also it could be as something as easy as

277
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
not exposing the stack trace

278
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,560
externally because if you pop up and

279
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,279
show that 404 error we see that entire

280
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,920
stack trace you see the operating system

281
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
you see the exact version

282
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
that's a tremendous amount

283
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
of leverage that the

284
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
criminals can have

285
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
so it's in this one you know it's going

286
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,480
from that transformation

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
you always have to be aware of what the

288
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,320
current state is and get to where you

289
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,959
want to be also you'll notice you know

290
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,959
here i grew up in space city down in

291
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,120
houston so i've got a lot of space ones

292
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,920
there

293
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
now they did go through and change it up

294
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
a little bit to your vulnerable and

295
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,800
outdated components used to be known

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
vulnerabilities

297
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,560
but they're always gunning for your jars

298
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
and they want to go through and yeah i

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
know i see some folks that are just

300
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,720
kind of laughing at some of my corny

301
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
items there but you know this is going

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
to stick in your mind isn't it

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,839
and it does the same way with the java

304
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,079
user groups there

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,720
just another reminder here you know when

306
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
components first start off

307
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,440
they're going to be all shiny and new

308
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,760
but as they get used you'll start to

309
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
have that paint or the end use

310
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
experience rub off and that's why you

311
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,399
have to have a continuous review of what

312
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,839
you have

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
and you need to be aware of what are you

314
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
going to do

315
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
when your applications break

316
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,200
how are you going to compensate for that

317
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
otherwise your end user is going to end

318
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
up

319
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
feeling like this after they've slipped

320
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,880
on that banana

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
how many different versions

322
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,519
of tomcat

323
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,959
apache

324
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
or any dependency that you have in your

325
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
organization how many are there and how

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
many do you not know about

327
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
and how many are still stuck in that

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,880
desktop

329
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,120
way there in that closet that nobody

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
knew about

331
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,519
and who knows they might still be

332
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,839
running os2 warp our novell netware

333
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,120
3.11 and every now and again they're

334
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
saying fire phasers

335
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
so here it's not just how many different

336
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
configurations but i also wanted to

337
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,399
point out things that

338
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,880
maybe you were going to add

339
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
some of those features but you never got

340
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
around to it but that vestigial code

341
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
is still there

342
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,920
and that's going to be another attack

343
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
surface that you weren't aware of

344
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
so you have to go through and

345
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
not just see where you are but do those

346
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,920
passive scans and active scans in your

347
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
environment and have that full on

348
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,360
discovery there

349
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,839
no matter how large

350
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,360
or how small

351
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,560
or even

352
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,399
how divergent

353
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,920
the two different development teams

354
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,720
might be you know if one's saying hey i

355
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
want to stick to the ground and just

356
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,880
have my double decker bus but the other

357
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
one saying spaceship spaceship spaceship

358
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
you know you've got to make sure that

359
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
they're on the same page there so this

360
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
is just you know i think everybody can

361
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,959
relate to this

362
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,120
uh the other thing that might come in

363
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,839
handy is if you were doing it live just

364
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,839
kind of dump all those out onto the

365
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,279
table and then see how many spill

366
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,199
and you're having to go through and find

367
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,720
them later on that will also encourage

368
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
those development teams to think about

369
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,800
what's going to happen there

370
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
all right

371
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,880
this one took a little bit of work

372
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
to go through and figure out exactly how

373
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,839
to come up with the story

374
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,680
so i was thinking of different things

375
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,279
joker stash

376
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,480
uh npm dependencies

377
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,560
and basically how

378
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
difficult it is

379
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,680
to scan those things from outside your

380
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
organization that's where using some of

381
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,320
the os tools dependency tracker

382
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
dependency check and the rest of them

383
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
but this way you know you've got your

384
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,959
developer here

385
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
and you always have to remind them

386
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,399
that all of those dependencies

387
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,720
all of those integrations

388
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
outside apis they might be relying on

389
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,880
they need to be aware that there are

390
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,839
dangerous parts out there and if they're

391
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,760
not aware of it

392
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,480
it's going to be transparent to them

393
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
and the criminals are going to be hidden

394
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,399
a little bit

395
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,639
but you've always got to make sure

396
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
that those get branches and dependencies

397
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
that you're used to using

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,839
haven't been taken over by a malicious

399
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,040
actor

400
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,279
because open source you know it takes

401
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,759
time it takes money

402
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,440
and sometimes those projects get

403
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,639
abandoned

404
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,639
way too early in the cycle

405
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,600
a lot of times there's going to be those

406
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
back doors

407
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
so understanding where that is

408
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
and framing it in terms of

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
financial impact

410
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
the financial impact is actually what

411
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
gets the business owners

412
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
the application

413
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,959
teams the people that have the money on

414
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,279
the table to invest in whether it's

415
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
performance or security

416
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,880
or integrity

417
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,959
and they're also the ones that are on

418
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,720
the boards so the easiest way to show

419
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
them the value

420
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,199
of your security efforts and being able

421
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,800
to align

422
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
with those development teams and being a

423
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
part of that is to show them the

424
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
financial impact

425
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,800
unfortunately today

426
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
most executives

427
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,880
are aware

428
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,199
of ransomware

429
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,240
but we do need to be more cognizant of

430
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,880
those government entities those small

431
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,600
schools those counties

432
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
it could be those muds the

433
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
municipal utility districts that we're

434
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
not thinking about but they do have

435
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
critical infrastructure ownership of the

436
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
water the power and we all know

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,559
the impact of not having power

438
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
resiliency because of our last winter

439
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,439
here

440
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,000
used to be in previous top tens you had

441
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,240
insufficient logging

442
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
but now it's going to be securing

443
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,280
sorry security logging and monitoring

444
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,559
developers need to understand

445
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,039
when they need to ask for help

446
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,559
and that it's okay to ask for help

447
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,240
and when you come in you need to have

448
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
an attitude of humility

449
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
and respect for them

450
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,440
instead of being a vigilante thinking

451
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
that you know everything

452
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
if you come in

453
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
in all your black suit

454
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,559
and say

455
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,000
i'm batman you know that's going to turn

456
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
them off and sorry i'm not will arnett

457
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,440
so i can't quite do that exactly right

458
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,600
but we have to be more

459
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,160
like a partnership and you could see

460
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
that there are others superheroes along

461
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,679
the spectrum

462
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,240
that take a cooperative approach

463
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
and later on i'll talk a little bit

464
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
about insider threats

465
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,480
but if you look at some of the

466
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,919
superheroes

467
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
and some of their approaches

468
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
you have to wonder

469
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
where are they on the spectrum have they

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,480
gone too far to the dark side or are

471
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
they still on the light are they in that

472
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,919
gray area so you have to be aware of the

473
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
personalities

474
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
of the people on your team

475
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
and how well they fit in

476
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,559
now just because you have someone that

477
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
can throw

478
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,360
the sharp

479
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,480
objects from far away versus an archer

480
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
you'll notice that those are completely

481
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,120
different mindsets and ones willing to

482
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,080
be open and honest about their identity

483
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,640
the other one cloaked in darkness just

484
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,919
an aside about personality on here and

485
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,679
it's not just

486
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,080
logging what's bad

487
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,039
but you also need to log what's good so

488
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
you're known good conditions so that you

489
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
can do those comparisons

490
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,679
if you don't know the expected messages

491
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,799
strings

492
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,400
event sources

493
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
you're not going to be able to detect

494
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,840
what's wrong

495
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
so understanding both the good

496
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,440
and the bad

497
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
and then sending that appropriately to

498
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
whatever auditing system

499
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,600
or event management system

500
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
because these days auditors

501
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,320
want to see

502
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,760
that flow of when it is good

503
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
when it's bad but when you have those

504
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
errors pop up what recovery actions

505
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,160
do you have

506
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,400
to then get your application and your

507
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,960
system back on track

508
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
along with being able to show all of

509
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,879
that audit trail

510
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,200
this one i just did

511
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,799
a little bit

512
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,880
differently it's uh this one's a little

513
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,559
bit harder to articulate and show just

514
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
on some slides

515
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
but you always have to make sure

516
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,000
that you are sanitizing your data

517
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
never trust

518
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,679
anything that's coming in

519
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,799
make sure

520
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,120
that you have those patterns and don't

521
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,679
just use regular expressions make sure

522
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,159
they have the parameterized queries and

523
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,080
all of the applicable security

524
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,280
frameworks

525
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,640
that have been shown to be known good

526
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,559
frameworks again

527
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,240
go back to the owasp guides

528
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,200
so many people get hung up on checking

529
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,559
off that box for the oauth top 10

530
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,840
and they never

531
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,559
see the full picture it's owa's top 10

532
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,760
risks

533
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,080
but we have proactive controls

534
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
we have cheat sheets we have different

535
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,280
tools we've got web goat we've got juice

536
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
shop we have various different

537
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
vulnerable web applications that you can

538
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
test in a safe way and get those junior

539
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,640
programmers up to speed along the way

540
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
you know because sometimes if you can

541
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
sanitize that data up front cleanly it's

542
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,200
a little bit easier

543
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
sometimes you have to take the nuclear

544
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
approach

545
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
and come back

546
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,480
and deal with all that fallout other

547
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
times it's just simply welding some of

548
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,960
those pieces together to make it

549
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
clear there

550
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,640
people don't use secure passwords

551
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
and they use them over and over and over

552
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,480
again

553
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
you have to anticipate that

554
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,280
and as much as possible

555
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,760
protect your users

556
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
if you aren't protecting your users

557
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
not only will they get upset but they

558
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,280
might come back and sue you

559
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,240
and try and claw back some of that money

560
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
even though it was their fault

561
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,760
so this one you know just talking more

562
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,480
about multi-factor authentication

563
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
and

564
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,440
get away as much as you can from just

565
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,200
sms texting

566
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,159
go with the apps and ideally if you can

567
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,480
go with hardware devices

568
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
but that's a little bit more expensive

569
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
for most organizations each day

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,159
so many people now

571
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,200
are broadcasting each and every move

572
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,480
they take on social media

573
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
if they're doing all of that

574
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
or if they know when the company has a

575
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,200
vacation or an extra holiday

576
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,080
these are going to be prime attacks

577
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
you also need to let

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,280
your junior members of your team know

579
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
that they can go through

580
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
and reach out

581
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
to other people to get that additional

582
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
check off and sign off before they just

583
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,600
send the money out the door you know

584
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
because actually he's got the tools

585
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,000
right here in his hand

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
he's got the shark repellent

587
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,840
that would keep away

588
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
all those jokers

589
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
trying to extract the cash through

590
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,840
business email compromise

591
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
if you haven't seen what if or think

592
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,760
about that i apologize here

593
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
our code can easily get corrupted

594
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,400
if we have those discussions ahead of

595
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,320
time those table top exercises and say

596
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,240
what should our code be what could it

597
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,039
become and by having those comparisons

598
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,440
side by side you know the cheerleader

599
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
here and the programmer

600
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
with the businessman and then also

601
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,600
what are your iterations

602
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
and what happens

603
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,039
and what could you replace that

604
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,799
corrupted code with

605
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,000
for those other items there

606
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,039
again and again we all know

607
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,360
that we have the limited time and they

608
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,080
don't right so we have to just kind of

609
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
clue in

610
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
those folks now

611
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,720
this is one thing that i touched on a

612
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
little bit before

613
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,840
but it is

614
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,760
important these days to understand

615
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
we have so many people

616
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,360
that end up becoming disgruntled

617
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,200
or jealous

618
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
or

619
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
actually

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
pulled away and they're actually

621
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,039
recruited to that dark side

622
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
so you know this is where we also need

623
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
to help

624
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
various people on their career path

625
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,679
and understand their motivations

626
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,520
their skills

627
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,880
along with their weaknesses

628
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
because you know just because you want

629
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
to be the next sidekick

630
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,679
doesn't mean that you have all the

631
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,600
skills right now

632
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
and rather than being

633
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,039
corrupted

634
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,000
and resurrected by joker or scarecrow

635
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
depending on which iteration

636
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,159
it's better to have that build up

637
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,440
you know

638
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,600
it could also be

639
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
that people change teams

640
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,320
out of fear

641
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,799
or out of desire so that's why we have

642
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,480
sinestro up here

643
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
with the green lantern over to the

644
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
yellow lantern and there's the whole

645
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,960
spectrum you can look at that later on

646
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,679
now sometimes it's not of their own

647
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,679
making

648
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,919
it could be that they were traumatized

649
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
or damaged

650
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,880
by someone else

651
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
so we have to be able to help pull those

652
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
people back in

653
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,120
and know that

654
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,559
they're going to be sometimes they're

655
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
willing to make the right choice other

656
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
times they're going to go over to the

657
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
wrong side there

658
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
and if we neglect

659
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,480
investing

660
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,640
in our team

661
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,919
they can become radicalized

662
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,279
and go their own way out of frustration

663
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,840
and pain

664
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,960
the hackers are going to calculate

665
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
the best time to infiltrate your

666
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
organization and a lot of times they'll

667
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,640
just go through there they're going to

668
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,960
be waiting sometimes with that stop

669
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
watch to hit it just right

670
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
but these days we're seeing them plan it

671
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,520
in

672
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,039
days or hours ahead or

673
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,000
on the calendar for those special days

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
in your environment

675
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
oops

676
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
we still have to say it and you know we

677
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,120
have to drill it into the heads of our

678
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
friends and family

679
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
just because they get some shiny new

680
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,799
watch

681
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,600
or

682
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,919
coffee maker or

683
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
used to be dvd player you know

684
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
they've got to realize that not

685
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
everything is safe

686
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,559
and those can be

687
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
attack points not only internally to

688
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,679
them

689
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,240
but being used externally

690
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,279
this is also another example of

691
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,559
your

692
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,400
security mentors

693
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
maybe not being aware

694
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
of those other teams that are trying to

695
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,360
wreak havoc on their systems so these

696
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,399
bots are simply waiting for that attack

697
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,719
order and wake up and go on from there

698
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,240
not quite application security uh on the

699
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,760
next kind of things

700
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,880
but it is related to security hygiene

701
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,360
and one of my other goals here was to

702
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,159
make

703
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
the overall training programs that your

704
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
hr department requires you to go through

705
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,399
every three months oh i got to sit

706
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,039
through look at all these words and if i

707
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,360
really want to just cheat the system at

708
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
the end i'm just going to take

709
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,600
screenshots not have to listen to it and

710
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,799
just check check check

711
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,200
being able to badge in

712
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,039
you know is important

713
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,440
otherwise you could have dastardly

714
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
felons

715
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,679
that are gonna come in and change up

716
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,159
your times whether it's supposed to be

717
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,039
duck season or now it's rabbit season

718
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,320
or it could be somebody else

719
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,960
sometimes people

720
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
have pity on somebody it could just be

721
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,159
the person out there that doesn't have

722
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
the badge oh are you waiting for

723
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
somebody oh who are you waiting for it's

724
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,000
like oh i'm waiting for so and so and

725
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,919
they picked that up from

726
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,799
linkedin or other social media

727
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
so it looks like they're supposed to be

728
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,039
in there

729
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
but you know

730
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
they shouldn't be and it's not just a

731
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,279
matter of doing it yourself

732
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,720
very recently

733
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
i had somebody that went ahead of me and

734
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,159
they said oh do you need to hold the

735
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,679
door nope

736
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,399
security practice each one of us logs in

737
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
separately

738
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
so taking that extra minute

739
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
to go through it

740
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,279
and i even had to challenge my boss one

741
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,159
time and say you can't piggyback did you

742
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,520
leave your badge

743
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,840
yeah i left it at my desk so

744
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
do you assume the business risk

745
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,559
of this violation

746
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,279
so he assumed the risk therefore i was

747
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
in the clear i took care of the security

748
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,399
requirements but then let the business

749
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,000
uh work there so this one you know

750
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
you don't want to open up the door

751
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
because you don't know who else could be

752
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
coming in from the sistar system

753
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,159
aarp

754
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
has articles time and time again

755
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,559
on how

756
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,960
folks in their population but across the

757
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,840
board

758
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,600
have issues

759
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,520
this is open enrollment season for

760
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,799
medicare

761
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,919
so our grandparents our parents

762
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,679
are prime

763
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,120
victims

764
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,279
for them calling up and asking for

765
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,960
their social security number their

766
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,559
medicare card

767
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,520
and they don't think twice about that so

768
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
we need to help them out in those

769
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,039
situations

770
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,880
whether it's somebody claiming to be

771
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,840
from first metropolitan marshall bank

772
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,640
or

773
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,200
if it's somebody saying this a sylvester

774
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,039
from system support

775
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,240
your system has been compromised

776
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
and then this is where we have to come

777
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,120
in

778
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
and tell our grandparents i think i

779
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,679
heard a scammer i did i did

780
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,640
it takes a lot of people to work

781
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
together on our development teams

782
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,840
but you don't have to be a dj

783
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,600
and you can get upset when people call

784
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
you dj sometimes you know just have your

785
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,919
own band

786
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,399
that you might not be completely okay

787
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,799
with people knowing and so you call in

788
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,960
that original dj

789
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
and it never hurts to have

790
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
every single kind of guitar out there in

791
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,000
every kind of variation

792
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,120
because this way you can hit the

793
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,320
spectrum whether it's a mariachi band

794
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,279
punk rock glam metal or

795
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,760
you know your old style

796
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,480
synthesizer keyboards used to be big

797
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,399
there in the 80s and 90s when i was

798
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,919
growing up

799
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,480
but remember we're in texas so you

800
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,840
always got to have the fiddle on the

801
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,200
band

802
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,399
we're not louisiana

803
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,120
when we work together we get that

804
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
cumulative effect

805
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,480
so it's not just us in silos

806
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,399
but we're able to protect

807
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,760
and make our applications even stronger

808
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,880
more resilient and able to withstand

809
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,320
anything that's coming out there

810
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,559
security it's not a laughing manner

811
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,279
it's not magic by any means even though

812
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,880
sometimes

813
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,960
we try to make it appear to our bosses

814
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,240
so that we have continued job security

815
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,120
but in texas you know sometimes it is

816
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,039
rocket science

817
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,399
and we do have several different

818
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
colleges here that still have phds in

819
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
aeronautical engineering

820
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,039
it's also a way for us to get involved

821
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,840
in mentorship

822
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,120
there are some great

823
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,600
sets out there

824
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,039
one is the women of nasa

825
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
if we don't understand the past

826
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,640
contributions

827
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,880
of that entire spectrum

828
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,279
we're not going to be open

829
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,159
to

830
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:48,960
the

831
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
insight and thoughts of the various

832
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,039
populations

833
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,840
so we need to be able to understand and

834
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,039
celebrate

835
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,320
and i don't know if you caught it at

836
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
first with the telescope but look at the

837
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,399
universe

838
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
and the galaxy and the way that the

839
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,480
picture is hidden there notice it's got

840
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,240
a muse or a female representation there

841
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
in that universe

842
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
it's our responsibility to pass on the

843
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,039
knowledge and

844
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,360
train that next generation

845
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,120
if you don't like all the space themes

846
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
whatever for your organization you can

847
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,240
always switch it up and make it

848
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,600
exactly what you need there

849
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,480
and

850
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,519
that

851
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,480
is

852
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,720
my presentation here

853
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
but what i want to do is just

854
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,960
make this

855
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,600
an open-ended conversation

856
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,320
now because i can't tell you

857
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,480
how many hundreds and hundreds of

858
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
minifigures i have and that i was

859
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,039
pulling out to try and figure out things

860
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,279
uh and how many pieces i've started

861
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,919
doing inventories but i'm not kidding

862
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,600
when i talk about how much money

863
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,200
you can start dropping if you're not

864
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,880
aware of it

865
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,200
and you'll start to see more and more

866
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,719
engagement

867
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,879
with uh building because you've got

868
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,560
different various shows out there

869
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
celebrities

870
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,159
uh you know they're prominent and

871
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,440
they're actually

872
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,679
actively recruiting adults to come into

873
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,560
the mix so i want to go ahead and

874
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,520
see if you all have ideas or questions

875
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,760
and brainstorm a little bit about how we

876
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,520
might make it work in your environment

877
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
before i need to pass it off to the next

878
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,119
speaker

879
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,119
all right

880
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,639
so

881
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,320
not hearing any comments yet

882
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,159
i'm going to try not to go through that

883
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,960
uh comedic dead space

884
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
but some of the ideas that i did have

885
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,800
uh coming alongside here that i didn't

886
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,839
yet

887
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,280
um

888
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,119
fully developed

889
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,000
where notice i didn't have any

890
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,320
wizarding world

891
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,839
scenarios but for those i did want to do

892
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,599
a little bit more

893
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,240
development say of the mentors

894
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,680
because there are

895
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
a large number of mentors

896
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,599
of various backgrounds that you could go

897
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,839
through and uh come into play there

898
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,720
yeah

899
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,599
if you needed to talk about pipelines or

900
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,040
like they were talking about in the last

901
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,079
session about those phases that might be

902
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,400
appropriate for trains

903
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
and then you could have your different

904
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,119
tracks being derailed or what have you

905
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,800
there

906
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,920
so i know i went really fast and it

907
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,839
wasn't my intention

908
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,320
to throw technical information to you

909
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,720
but to keep you awake after lunch and

910
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,560
get you thinking

911
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
if you do have ideas or you want to get

912
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,480
some of the photos you want me to

913
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,599
collaborate

914
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
with your owass chapter or if you want

915
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,240
to contribute to the san jac student

916
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,359
chapter

917
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,440
please let me know on that so appreciate

918
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,040
your time this gives you a little bit of

919
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,320
a bio break as well and before the next

920
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,680
presenter has to come on line

921
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,909
[Applause]
