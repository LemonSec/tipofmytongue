1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:18,320
[Music]

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,080
it has hr perspective as well as

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
security perspective

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,359
uh almost 140 courses now aicpa

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
validation we are recognized by state of

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,720
texas

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
contract with some large corporations

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
six billion dollar companies all that so

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,399
so far so good looks okay

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
uh let's see how the next six months uh

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,000
we do there

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,480
it's worth visiting have a look at it if

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,399
you guys need any free stuff

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,840
we can give that free stuff the whole

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
idea is educating education here not

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,559
making money but we have to sustain the

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,640
platform cost and all that so it's very

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,680
robust

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
almost 14 000 minutes worth of course is

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
8 000 in pipeline

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
and made for the people like

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,920
us you know so anybody has any idea and

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,199
you feel like that hey this is the

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,760
knowledge i want to leave behind

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
then please come and meet me we'll

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,439
capture that knowledge and written it on

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
this platform that's the whole legacy of

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
this platform a lot of us are highly

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
educated we have spent 20 30 years in

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,640
the field

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
so knowledge has to be for the benefit

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
of others so we want to live that legacy

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
of our knowledge so

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,240
if you feel you have knowledge you have

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
ideas come and meet me i would capture

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
it i'll get it in the form of the

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
courses here

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
in the process you will get some small

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
benefit i don't know how it works

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,479
but it's looking good

41
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,320
i i was in vegas last week at

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,799
development at dave and learn conference

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
and uh met a bunch of nice people there

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
too

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,439
okay

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,799
so it's time

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,520
you have any questions on this one

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
is it just what's the website for this

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,840
place security.com.com

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
it's my email here

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
and the inoseg.com is in the email there

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
you can visit on the phone we took a lot

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
of papers in these colors and the

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,680
branding i couldn't believe it myself

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
that we are capable of doing such a nice

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,119
job

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
at the end of the journey i liked it

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
myself what you did it's like a netflix

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
website i can take off my courses and

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
put the movies it will work

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
so

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
somebody once said that why don't you

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,040
file a patent for the website itself i

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,480
said man who has money for that

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
so let's go from here it's one o'clock

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,280
guys right on time

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
let me put my connector here

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,360
so we're speaking about cloud security

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,959
and compliance let me see if it all

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,840
works very fine

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
we have 40 minutes how much time we have

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
40 45 minutes

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,560
yep

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
so i'll try to be

75
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
uh

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
try to give you an idea we're not going

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
to go too much granular in depth a bunch

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
of slides there but we'll focus on

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
certain slides to get an idea of what it

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
looks like

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,760
uh conceptually i'm not going to teach

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
you what is cloud security i believe

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,519
that somebody everybody has some

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,239
foundation about is past sas we know

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
these words at the same time

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,040
we know

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,800
much of a compliance which goes into the

88
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
market what we are trying to see is that

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,599
with the use case like aws how does

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,360
cloud security helps us with the

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,480
compliance

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
so i took a help of the person who's a

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
mvp in aws amazon

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
she gave me a bunch of their proprietary

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
slides to

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,959
shared with me

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,400
and

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,959
that helps me a lot to fire to fine-tune

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
how the aws can help us or what they

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
provide so essentially in the beginning

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,679
of the course

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
we'll define what what's cloud security

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
what are the risk factors which take

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
into consideration and i personally

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,599
believe in simplification of the things

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,840
i really not a big fan of making things

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
complex or they look complex no that's

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,640
not the objective the objective is that

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
nobody would like to hear the word it's

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,319
complex the more you feel that hey it's

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,640
doable it's manageable it's not going to

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
cost too much of money that's been my

113
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,959
that's i'm a main proponent of that one

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,159
that's whether you know you know sick

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
comments to play too uh once again

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
briefly those people who have come late

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
my name is

118
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,079
but pronouncing fellow naked islam so i

119
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,279
started it to p e l so

120
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,238
charupalinosek.com that's cyber security

121
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,639
charo at security.com is our e-learning

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,000
platform

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
briefly what we are going to learn is uh

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
cloud security reports sponsored by ic

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
square this is a good report to study

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
which gives the idea of what people are

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,240
looking at

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
what are the challenges we have

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
cloud computing risk what are the risk

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
factors involved in the cloud computing

131
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
again that cloud security report review

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
little bit of slides on that cloud

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,280
concerns cloud security challenges and

134
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
framework

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,479
uh which takes into account we are not

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,320
going into csf remote we are more

137
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
towards the cloud side of the framework

138
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,400
okay

139
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
briefly

140
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
as he rightly said z is missing d is

141
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,199
missing some of the alphabets are

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,039
missing but that's okay

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,360
uh rest is everywhere uh i come from the

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
financial background guys

145
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,680
i'm a chartered accountant i'm a cpa and

146
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
got deep down into compliance on cyber

147
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
securities you can speak with me debit

148
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
credit capitalization and you can speak

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
with me ip address i'll speak that

150
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,639
language

151
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,400
uh

152
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
founder of innosex security this is a

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
dream come true almost 25 years in

154
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
experience uh started way back in 90s

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
the whole career

156
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,960
today 2021

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
i'll skip this slides almost all the

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
areas i have worked with fortune 500 and

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
all those companies

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,560
this is how if you go to the innosec

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
first page looks like i'll skip some of

162
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
the slides which are intro related

163
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,639
uh four families of services this is how

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,800
the we give the free assessment on the

165
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
website you can go free assessment free

166
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,479
on demand assessment you don't need to

167
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,840
spend money on this this is like a

168
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,400
maturity model of assessment we try to

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
make it free for the companies you don't

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,479
have to spend money on this one click it

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,639
register it and it gives you maturity of

172
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,479
all the controls which are involved and

173
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
you can self-evaluate yourself

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,479
uh new thing we are trying to do is a

175
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
ransom harassment we are actually

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,720
creating grc like applications where you

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
can evaluate your ransomware we are

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,400
trying to make it free also you have

179
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,039
ransomware here too which is a quick one

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,199
this is much much granular but the whole

181
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,360
idea is that we took whole international

182
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
things into account

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,960
uh this is how the platform looks like

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,160
security

185
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
you can click on cyber security

186
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
compliance that train on the top and you

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
can get to the demos demos are just

188
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,039
teasers

189
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,960
uh you click there you can request for

190
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
the full-fledged interactive demos

191
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
uh let me go to the next one

192
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,520
yeah we work with texas banker we work

193
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,680
with dir too

194
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
let's start the conversation cloud

195
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,759
security

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
104

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,400
what are the cloud computing risk

198
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,000
and i'm going to interact with you guys

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,199
and

200
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
let's expect some kind of communication

201
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
between us together

202
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
so first of all how many people are

203
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
actually uh

204
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
working in the cloud space today anyone

205
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
here

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
okay you guys are not supposed to ask me

207
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
any question not supposed to challenge

208
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,840
me if i'm wrong tell me after 45 minutes

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,080
risk associated with cloud computing is

210
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
no different than those applicable to

211
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,039
idea environment within the organization

212
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,759
that statement is really true i felt

213
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,840
from the beginning personally that hey

214
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,800
everything was inside in on-prem now we

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,560
are just putting in the cloud many

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
people had data centers away from their

217
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
own location scattered around the

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,479
country but now instead of doing that

219
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
you go to google and you use aws

220
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,199
tools to do that

221
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,800
the difference may originate from cloud

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
service model technology operation we

223
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
are going to see this with the graph

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
the characteristic cloud computing led

225
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,080
to enormous okay that's everybody knows

226
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
about it

227
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,039
key concerns related to law we are going

228
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
to visit that the discussion of broad

229
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,520
risk areas we are going to visit that

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
will explore different aspects of cloud

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
risk and cloud security in relation to

232
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
aws i wrote azure but i'm silent on

233
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
azure i'm mostly focusing on aws you

234
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,599
just get too long

235
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,240
presentation

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,800
so this is nice study guys and this is

237
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
where we are going to interact 2021

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
cloud security report sponsored by isis

239
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
where anybody has seen this report

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
if you guys know that's good for me then

241
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
based on comprehensive survey of

242
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
sensitive 750 cyber security

243
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
professionals of course is a

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,719
questionnaire it's a survey so

245
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,399
there will be some kind of margin of

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
error there

247
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,200
let us cloud secret trends report

248
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,599
reveals how organizations are responding

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
to security threats in the block what do

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
some best practices cyber security are

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
considering

252
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,200
we are not going that much granular in

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
the report but you can google that i'm

254
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,680
going to touch base on the main aspects

255
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,440
of the report which we should know about

256
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
it and where to focus

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,640
uh firmly believe 80 20 rules

258
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
80 percent you can manage 20 you really

259
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,560
have to focus or spend money

260
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
okay

261
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
i want to uh

262
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,399
there are three top level areas which

263
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
you feel are mostly

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
we concern about risk in cloud can you

265
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,720
guys name any one of them what will be

266
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
the first you feel

267
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
top most cloud security concern

268
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
you guys can answer everyone

269
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,199
yep one of them

270
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,839
yes if i'm going to recollect my memory

271
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,040
i'm going to bring it on the top here

272
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
data loss leakage data privacy

273
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
confidentiality which is a disclosure

274
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,680
accidental exposure of credentials so

275
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
among the respondents 64

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
right on the top which data disclosure

277
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
data leakage

278
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
data privacy confidential 62 means out

279
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
of 750 people 62 percent were saying

280
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,959
this one

281
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,720
accidental exposure of credential

282
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,320
credential 46 percent

283
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,399
now there are some bunch of things here

284
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,720
i would rather say that you can always

285
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
read but that's our focus correct this

286
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
is where we are going to focus what how

287
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,959
the cloud security looks like

288
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,959
uh

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
these are other concerning are legal and

290
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
regulatory compliance visibility

291
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
transparency incident response

292
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
uh data sovereignty residency and

293
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
control this one

294
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
many of the companies already taking

295
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
care of it

296
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
i don't know almost each and every

297
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
country is saying keep the data within

298
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
the country you can't transfer and there

299
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,279
are lawsuits almost all around the world

300
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,519
uh banks are saying you can't transfer

301
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,760
data even to the extent i heard in india

302
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,760
mastercard and indian government was

303
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
almost to the extent of whether

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,200
mastercard will work on india or not

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
because they don't want any of the pci

306
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,120
data going out of the country

307
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,760
so that was the latest case on that one

308
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
but uh

309
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,320
there are lots of aspect involved in it

310
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
what do you see as the biggest security

311
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,279
threats in public clouds

312
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,519
yep oh thank you that's great

313
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,640
so

314
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,240
this has been concerned for many people

315
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,800
misconfiguration of the cloud platform

316
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
uh

317
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
i'm not sure it's like we almost now

318
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
spent 10 year plus in trying to perfect

319
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,519
this area of cloud microsoft

320
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
azure everybody has been in this space

321
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
but still we find this is one of the

322
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
important area

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
i feel strongly is not because there is

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
an issue now a lot of small big

325
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,360
companies are getting into space

326
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
everybody has a budget constraint and

327
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,920
each one according to his budgets tries

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,079
to do one step at a time there are

329
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
legacy systems sometimes they don't know

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,880
how to transfer some people have a don't

331
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
want to go straight to the cloud keep

332
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,240
partially here

333
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
you know try to balance the two things

334
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,079
and that has been the nightmare the

335
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,680
biggest night for either you do full

336
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,240
cloud you do full on prem when you try

337
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
to do half year half year

338
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
that's where that misconfiguration thing

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,959
is uh really causing a lot of trouble uh

340
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
some of the clients have seen speaking

341
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,880
again and again about this subject but

342
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
you put everything in the cloud uh as

343
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
you see in the slides coming uh in the

344
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
next slides that uh

345
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,440
even

346
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
aws folks are so much on it they have a

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,079
complete representation to help you out

348
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,560
what may come to succeed in the cloud

349
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
that much of support you're going to get

350
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
from them

351
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
sensitive data unauthorized access

352
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
coming back to your access control

353
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
insecure interfaces

354
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
external sharing of data hijacking of

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
accounts malicious insider foreign

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
sponsor cyber attacks

357
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
so this is the picture you say when it

358
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,639
comes to threats in public clouds

359
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
what are your biggest operational

360
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
day-to-day headaches trying to perfect

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
cloud workloads

362
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,560
hey where is gone

363
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,279
disappeared

364
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
yeah

365
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
it did disappear okay i'll bring it up

366
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
after some time

367
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
okay

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,440
no if technology works we won't be here

369
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,839
so it's good sometime it doesn't work

370
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
i'm very happy with this

371
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
all i did is that moved it from my own

372
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,680
laptop to my wife's laptop so

373
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
you know

374
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
cloud security challenges

375
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
okay

376
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
second the slides are deceptive here

377
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,480
slide number 16 why it's not showing

378
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
it should work fine cool

379
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,839
give me a second guys

380
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
i know this is that slide number six and

381
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,279
i don't know why it was not showing up

382
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
but uh you can see here

383
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,480
now

384
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
um

385
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,240
yeah but then why the slide was showing

386
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
and not the picture it did show us the

387
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
blank one so that's also surprising

388
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,600
nevertheless

389
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
you can see it correct uh doesn't matter

390
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,560
okay it moves

391
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
uh i'll start with the effect so this is

392
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,399
important that's the reason about

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,399
examples of service available in cloud

394
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,560
consumer if you understand what we are

395
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
trying to do in the

396
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
what you are trying to do in the cloud

397
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
understand what sas services are

398
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
available what's platform as a service

399
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,279
what infrastructure as a service this is

400
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
critical guys when you speak about

401
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,800
security this is something you should

402
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,560
know right from the beginning

403
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
uh once you understand

404
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
what you are trying to secure then only

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,160
know what you how you are going to

406
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,920
secure okay

407
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
so that's the reason i wanted to go back

408
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
to these slides then we'll come back to

409
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,719
this one in a normal format

410
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,320
secure it in the cloud identity and

411
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
access control what are the challenges

412
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
we face in the cloud this is very

413
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,560
critical

414
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,720
access control is time and again we

415
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
discuss about it a lot of tools

416
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,040
available uh i'll show you how many

417
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
tools actually

418
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
uh

419
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
aws amazon people have made available

420
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
governance is another

421
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
big area

422
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,240
uh

423
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,680
you know in the early stage and even

424
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,399
today cloud security alliance uh

425
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,000
recognized officially iso 27001 correct

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
they didn't go and recognize nst they

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,839
didn't even mention about any other

428
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
other thing cobait or whatever they

429
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,160
actually recognize iso 27001

430
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
i felt one of the driving factors if you

431
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
look at iso 27000 is something called

432
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,639
isms five mandatory controls if you

433
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
understand compliance very well those

434
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,079
five mandatory controls in the isms

435
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,839
implementation all have to do with

436
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,440
governance

437
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
many of these stock ones shock to other

438
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
compliances you'll find a good technical

439
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,839
process oriented you don't find

440
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
governance aspect involved in it and the

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
biggest thing which you know which is a

442
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,000
nightmare is actually governance if you

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,279
understand governance you have

444
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,800
committees you have structure you have

445
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,279
reporting in place many of the problems

446
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
will be able to solve so you will recent

447
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,959
time and again we'll see governance is

448
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,959
taking a lot it's it's taking a like of

449
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,880
one of the priorities now when it comes

450
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
to security

451
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,199
skill shortages as as always that's the

452
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
issue monitoring and response

453
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,079
a lot of steps have been taken by

454
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,559
organization there are many uh

455
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
tools available in the market which can

456
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
take care of monitoring almost every

457
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,480
corporation is making it available

458
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,319
next one data leakages the cost of

459
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
sensitive data leaking from the cloud

460
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,280
storage

461
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,039
some of this stuff i presume guys you

462
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
are aware of it so i'll uh quickly move

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,599
to the next one shadow id

464
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
uh this is the biggest one has anybody

465
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
experienced shadow id examples in your

466
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,640
office

467
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,919
have you gone through this one this is

468
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,200
really interesting it's really

469
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
fascinating when you come to know that

470
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
how many people have used your corporate

471
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
names and actually created the cloud

472
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,960
cloud environment created websites and

473
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
all that has anybody did this kind of

474
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,799
audit

475
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
so

476
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,799
uh

477
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
it's it's really uh

478
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
interesting and it's a very big bang

479
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
almost talking about 20 30 billion so

480
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
banks are in revenue so trillion dollars

481
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,919
plus in assets

482
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
and that kind of banks there are people

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,679
there is a lot of creativity so they

484
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
have a department we just keep scanning

485
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
uh websites to find out if somebody has

486
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
gone and created something in the name

487
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
of the company correct

488
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
domain may not be

489
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,240
xyz.com this is always you know sub

490
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,320
domains and all that they try to create

491
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
and then they try to create that whole

492
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
thing in place and you have to scan and

493
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
find out so there is a training in

494
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
security and about just dedicated to

495
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
shadow id because i liked it when i saw

496
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
this one i was i couldn't believe that

497
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
is it possible is it possible even for

498
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,720
the organization people to do like that

499
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,240
but i think developers are really

500
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,480
creative people and their creativity is

501
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
at peak when they see that cloud and

502
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
they feel that the cloud belongs to them

503
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
so they do everything what they want to

504
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,080
do in the cloud it's really fascinating

505
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,000
issues can vary depending on the type of

506
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
the cloud audit and compliance issues

507
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
can differ

508
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,799
uh

509
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
i think this is not a secret on the

510
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,919
other hand software as a service locks

511
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
down processing on the vendor side

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
application features

513
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,200
again it comes down to the type of the

514
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
cloud you have i'll explain it one with

515
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
a nice graphical

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,200
uh presentation here

517
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
so

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,400
this graph will tell you what happened

519
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
in structure managed by owned by located

520
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
infrastructure

521
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
if it's a public cloud third party

522
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
provider third party provided

523
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
off-premise just just take into account

524
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,559
then i'll explain this slide

525
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
so

526
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
if you have a hybrid cloud see the

527
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
responsibility both organization third

528
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
party provider has a responsibility

529
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
that's what you see here private

530
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
community cloud that's another part of

531
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,080
it uh you must know conceptually what

532
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,240
cloud you're into there could be private

533
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,000
cloud and the public cloud which is in

534
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
the uh like aws you're just getting some

535
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,080
instance into the market whether you

536
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
take it as a sas whether you take it to

537
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
the ice or pass you basically in the

538
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
cloud

539
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
third party cloud correct so you have to

540
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,840
understand

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,600
pretty much this is diagram you can take

542
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,120
a picture of it but this is something

543
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
you must know before you even recommend

544
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,720
to the person that hey what are we

545
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
trying to do as a security

546
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,559
and uh

547
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
i don't even know where i found this

548
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
particular one but i really liked it it

549
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
just tells you immediately that how we

550
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,520
are going to approach the security in

551
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,840
the cloud

552
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,280
infrastructure implies physical

553
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
infrastructure such as facilities

554
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
compute network storage equipments

555
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,640
uh both physical aspects come into play

556
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
and where the sock one sock tools are

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
coming into play too

558
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
cloud security domains architectural

559
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
concepts and design requirement cloud

560
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
data security

561
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,280
very crucial cloud platform

562
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
infrastructure security application

563
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,559
security operations legal and compliance

564
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,799
this is your universe when it comes to

565
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,400
security

566
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,840
and

567
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,679
there could be creativity guys doesn't

568
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,440
matter how people place it these are the

569
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,039
areas you're going to come across when

570
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
it comes to cloud security so your

571
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,000
foundation

572
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
the very basics uh principle that hey if

573
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
i want to know what to do or how to do

574
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,799
you should know what are the areas

575
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,159
you're trying to

576
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
trying to implement the security so once

577
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,400
again architecture

578
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
data platform

579
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,720
application operation operation secret

580
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,000
is very critical

581
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
legal and compliance

582
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,799
we're going to go and look at it

583
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,960
so

584
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
this is like a

585
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,000
cloud reference model from csa

586
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,840
you can see infrastructure as a service

587
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
up to what level they can control

588
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,919
platform as a service whatever

589
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,799
and

590
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,720
computer and storage rapid application

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
development sas represent this will i'll

592
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
explain it much much better in

593
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,240
granular reference model

594
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
let me look at the time accordingly i

595
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
will

596
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,918
19 okay we are 30 minutes

597
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,039
okay

598
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
broad areas of the risk

599
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,679
i need your help guys so

600
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
what could be we already seen couple of

601
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
slides and what could be the area of the

602
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
areas of the risk which are summarized

603
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
or divided into 10 categories

604
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
authentication

605
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
privilege user access

606
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,679
uh

607
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
if you spend 15 20 years in the industry

608
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,080
you will understand privileged user

609
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
access is a really nightmare

610
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
if you you're saying that i'm a hacker

611
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,039
and i'm going to hack into corporation

612
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,880
and i'm sitting there quite for the last

613
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,640
six months because i'm waiting to get

614
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
access to one of the privileged user

615
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,360
account

616
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
they are not enjoying there they don't

617
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
like to sit there all they're waiting

618
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,200
for six months and being dormant to find

619
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,840
out how can they scale up

620
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,320
and looking for dormant privileged user

621
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,559
access account that's what they do

622
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,159
personally i believe that they're in the

623
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,120
air in today even in my

624
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
application they may be sitting there

625
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,400
quite looking for

626
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
that particular privilege account

627
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
because what we don't know we don't know

628
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
about it that's principally i believe so

629
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
we just call it we got hacked when we

630
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,159
come to know about it and they get some

631
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
privilege access

632
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,320
text dot is one of the best examples if

633
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
you have studied the case of text dot

634
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,559
and read about it is a fascinating

635
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,679
example

636
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,320
of how that whole hack happened

637
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,880
of course solar wind is another

638
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,760
another level altogether

639
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,840
uh even i tried to get solarwind guy to

640
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,480
speak in one of the panel

641
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,320
uh discussion but they didn't

642
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,919
uh i still didn't get a reply

643
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,400
data security and privacy

644
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,320
anybody familiar with the guys you have

645
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,360
read gdpr here

646
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,159
it's fabulous so let me just give an

647
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,200
idea

648
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
quickly do read gdpr whatever is going

649
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
to happen around the world is going to

650
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,840
be centered around gdpr it's well

651
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
written privacy

652
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,720
uh and there are articles one to do

653
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,440
uh if you want free access to the gdpr

654
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,360
training those people who are sitting

655
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
here just email me i'll give free access

656
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
to all of you to gdpr training it's one

657
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,360
of the best way we have done it we

658
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
actually explained uh article by article

659
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
what's the right of consent and all that

660
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,440
and

661
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,919
whether it's a ccpa or any other law

662
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,360
coming we are going to see around the

663
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,039
world and the way the privacy will be

664
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,279
designed and even what will be called as

665
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,039
pii phi

666
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,120
is well defined in that particular law

667
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
so i would recommend even if you are

668
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
absent people and if you if you are

669
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,400
saying that hey i'm more concerned about

670
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,880
data privacy before you utter the word

671
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,360
data privacy you should understand what

672
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,960
you're speaking about and i would say

673
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,279
that don't look around anywhere not

674
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,080
required just study the gdpr it's really

675
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
neat and clean uh don't try to learn too

676
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,919
much keep it at a high level but

677
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,279
if you're speak uttering the word

678
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,360
privacy you must know that because

679
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,600
it's it's not about just securing the

680
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,000
private data it's all about even can i

681
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,919
use the private data do have your

682
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,799
consent to use the private data

683
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
to what extent i can store the data if

684
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
the purpose for which i collected data

685
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,240
from you

686
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,799
is no more being the purpose now correct

687
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
so i let's say connect collected data

688
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,400
for the marketing intention

689
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
but that purpose is over and no longer

690
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,360
you uh doing that one then i can't keep

691
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,559
your data

692
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,240
i'm not supposed to have it because the

693
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,919
lawful purpose the definition called

694
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,760
lawful purpose that's why you are

695
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
supposed to use it if that lawful

696
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
purpose doesn't stay there i should not

697
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,360
be having your data at all i must remove

698
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,600
it and it's a requirement it's not just

699
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
so if if facebook is paying penalty

700
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
google is paying penalties millions and

701
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
billions that's the only reason that

702
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
they are not following all these

703
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,440
requirements there

704
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,720
and

705
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,520
but

706
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
when it comes to privacy you must know

707
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
that interfacing with internal systems

708
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,400
system availability

709
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,279
business continuity uh it's very very

710
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,279
crucial one of the areas i would always

711
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,520
say that whether it's a ransomware

712
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
whether it's a privacy whether it's an

713
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,600
encryption uh you may speak about

714
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
anything in the world

715
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,679
you must know business continuity the

716
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
reason behind is that hacks are going to

717
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,760
happen i don't know you guys were in the

718
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,679
keynote speaker today morning listening

719
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,320
to jeff and he said that hey is this the

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
right way to do the things or not right

721
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,080
whether do the things correct that has

722
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,159
been conversation or

723
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,559
behind whether the appsec is doing

724
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,480
doing its job or not or we are just

725
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,400
stagnant and i always look security as

726
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
an enterprise risk not just one aspect

727
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,279
could be application security but it is

728
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,200
a risk-based approach you must know what

729
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
are the risk involved and then decide

730
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
what area you're going to focus on

731
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,600
correct you should not be over investing

732
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
in the application security when your

733
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
priorities are different so

734
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,039
uh

735
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
just to give that in a broad perspective

736
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,240
is all about enterprise risk management

737
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
and under enterprise risk management

738
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,840
business continuity is always going to

739
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
get the good rating you have to have it

740
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,120
okay

741
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
so control environment regulatory

742
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,679
compliance

743
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
long-term viability and the ownership of

744
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
content and other legal requirement this

745
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,520
is very crucial

746
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
and the regulatory compliance is very

747
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
crucial that's where you can saw in the

748
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,440
earlier part when we did isc square

749
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,320
report we had almost 46 47 percent of

750
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
the people saying it's a nightmare and

751
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,399
it's truly nightmare but i'm going to

752
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,000
show you how aws helps there

753
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,320
adopting cloud requires an organization

754
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,919
to rethink security to effectively

755
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,520
safeguard assets and data i'm going to

756
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,039
go quickly

757
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,600
prepare cloud security reference model

758
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,520
security strategy risk assessment

759
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,240
control framework technology roadmap

760
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,320
very much important each of this aspect

761
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,480
security strategy one of the things what

762
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,200
we

763
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,440
where we felt is that

764
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,440
how you're going to secure your house

765
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
just think about it when you construct

766
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,880
the house you build the doors you build

767
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,159
the windows and first thing you think

768
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
about is that is security how's the

769
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
neighbor looks like do i need video

770
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,039
cameras all these things is really very

771
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,240
very important when it comes to

772
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
organization i always use the word

773
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,919
simplify

774
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,840
make it more easy for the people that's

775
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,520
where it comes to

776
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,279
risk assessment

777
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,960
control framework technology roadmap

778
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
you kind of do a

779
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,440
word analysis the vendor analysis how do

780
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
you broker procure

781
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,600
gartner has a very good framework on the

782
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,080
vendor management uh if you guys get a

783
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
chance to read it it's a free

784
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
it tells you how to onboard vendor

785
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,200
and gives you a good idea of

786
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,399
what are the steps what are the due

787
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,159
diligence involved

788
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,480
okay those people who are coming late

789
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,039
they owe me lunch

790
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,879
then you're most welcome

791
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,720
you just need to go and tell them

792
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
framing and vendor selection value

793
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
prototype

794
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,399
high level architecture low level

795
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
architecture implement orchestrate i'll

796
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
go fix oversight management service

797
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
management supply management

798
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
contract review technology gap analysis

799
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,799
slr negotiation scaling plan i don't the

800
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,520
sl is also one of the nightmare okay

801
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,279
it's very difficult to

802
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,559
get there

803
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,360
now

804
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
let's look at very important very good

805
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,320
stuff

806
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,918
cloud security reference model

807
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,840
i'm going to go quick and i'm going to

808
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,600
explain and generally when

809
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,440
when i'm doing if there's a time

810
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,600
available i tell people to answer the

811
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,039
question and come up with this reference

812
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,640
model yourself

813
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
but

814
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,919
it's not difficult to decide

815
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,679
all the risk areas are being captured

816
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,000
here identity access management data

817
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,679
security platform encryption management

818
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
it's a huge area encryption management

819
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,360
is well supported by all these people

820
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,279
aws i'll show it to you guys

821
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,120
logging monitoring cloud supply

822
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
management training and awareness

823
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,279
application development secure

824
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,799
development secure testing change

825
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,640
management very crucial

826
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,039
responsive security management i'm not

827
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,640
explaining i presume guys you know all

828
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
this thing okay so that's why i'm not

829
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
going to go granular

830
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,880
legal electronic discovery

831
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,760
cloud security baseline so what what the

832
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
best line means all these providers

833
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,000
public providers provide something of

834
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,399
some level correct they give you

835
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,640
company secretary baseline cloud service

836
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,159
provider security baseline they're

837
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,000
giving some baseline for you on the top

838
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,360
of that you have to start building all

839
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,080
these things and you need to understand

840
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,000
that at a particular point of time

841
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,919
this is limited in space you how to

842
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
start create training and awareness is

843
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,880
very very crucial here

844
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
i'll go quickly

845
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,279
what are the challenges constantly

846
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
evolving regulatory requirements

847
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
unique uh unique risk and regulatory

848
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,760
challenges requirements that vary

849
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
significantly across the highly dynamic

850
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,720
security threat what this means is that

851
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,559
many organizations correct the

852
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,440
widespread regionally locally and

853
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,440
everybody has his own requirements you

854
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,360
should be aware of that that's what it

855
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,320
is

856
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
and

857
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,360
you guys can read this one limited

858
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,039
specialist security compliance let's go

859
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,120
to the

860
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
so let's come to the amazon house the

861
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
amazon shared responsibility model looks

862
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,840
like

863
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
customer responsibility for security in

864
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,360
the cloud

865
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,679
your data your platform application

866
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,679
identity access management operating

867
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,799
system network firewall configuration

868
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,760
client-side data server-side encryption

869
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
everything belongs to you

870
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
you fail you cannot blame the cloud

871
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,559
people as simple as that

872
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
so they they did a very nice job put

873
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
told you are responsible for everything

874
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,000
else which is what say on-prem or when

875
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,360
you're coming to the cloud there's not

876
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,039
much of a difference

877
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,440
you're just getting infrastructure ready

878
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
and you're building a security on top of

879
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,840
it

880
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,559
what's aws is responsible for software

881
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,399
that's where basically all those

882
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,919
containers and everything which you're

883
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,039
looking for

884
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,880
compute storage database networking

885
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,200
hardware global infrastructure regions

886
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,760
availability zones edge locations

887
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,919
typical terms they use it in

888
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
amazon regions availabilities one's edge

889
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,640
location a concept called

890
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,799
security tower that's what they use the

891
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,799
word

892
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
now

893
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
expectations here internal audit team

894
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,880
aws third party auditors

895
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
sock one sock to report is something

896
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
which you rely on mainly for the public

897
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,640
cloud space

898
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,799
uh how many guys have read the stock to

899
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,240
report here have you ever reviewed the

900
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,919
software reports great so

901
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,080
uh among the trust service criteria for

902
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,519
the people who are not seen the software

903
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,600
report quickly i'll brush up you guys

904
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,120
that different kind of trust service

905
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,159
criteria journey started from sas 70 to

906
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,600
ssa 16 to scc 18 okay i'm a compliance

907
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
freak guys so i can really dictate

908
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,159
everything

909
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,840
so among that that are fight trust

910
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,960
service criteria or they call it cc1 cc2

911
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,039
that actually used to be common criteria

912
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,240
now they call it tsc which is

913
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,600
trustworthy but they kept the

914
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,120
nomenclature cis is still there so

915
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,600
you'll see 1.1 cc 1.2

916
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,679
among them uh previously it was not

917
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,679
mandatory but now

918
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,120
under the flagship

919
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
first service criteria which is the

920
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,159
security

921
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,320
all the controls are mandatory what it

922
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
says that you must show that you

923
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,760
implemented all these controls under

924
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,640
security for any cpa to certify that you

925
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,679
are complying with sock to sock one

926
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,200
is just telling you that you have

927
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
process in place policies procedures you

928
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,080
have it sock to involve actual testing

929
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,919
that you actually implemented and you

930
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,240
have evidence to support it that's what

931
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,799
sock one software is all about so among

932
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,640
that there is a type one and type two

933
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
correct sock one and sock two

934
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
so

935
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,080
when you look at the sock to report okay

936
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,679
uh one of the things you are going to

937
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,240
look for is that all the controls which

938
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
are listed there whether they have say

939
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,960
that tested comply tested compliant no

940
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
issues no issues that

941
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
in a simple terms

942
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,280
but you can go to the cpa icpa website

943
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
and download all the controls and map

944
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,879
that they have consider all the controls

945
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,960
it's a requirement if any of the

946
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
certified public accountant signs that

947
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,399
document that means he

948
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,719
verifies all these 100 200 controls

949
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,918
under security are taken into

950
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
consideration then you have availability

951
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,520
is another criteria which is most

952
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,719
commonly

953
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,960
accepted another criteria which is most

954
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,800
commonly accepted is a privacy so you

955
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,320
have five different criterias called

956
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,560
trust service criterias each of them has

957
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,399
a controls and those controls are

958
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,719
documented policy procedures and

959
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,119
evidence and tested by the cpa that's

960
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,040
what sock one soft is about that's what

961
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,359
the third party comes into play

962
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,079
so

963
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
anybody who's working in the cloud or

964
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,079
the security space should know soft one

965
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,200
sock two

966
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,240
what sock one software does here iso

967
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,839
27001 does it internationally in

968
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,680
international people will going to ask

969
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
you are you iso certified

970
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
approach is different it has

971
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,800
mandatory control under isms section 125

972
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
and then you go on all the way from the

973
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,800
607 all the way up to 18.

974
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
18 domains inside each domain they have

975
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
a control and you have to audit is very

976
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,800
easy when it comes to isms

977
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,880
certified organizations are supposed to

978
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,200
that audit but it's very light audit the

979
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,920
intention of the iso 27000 that you give

980
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
a due consideration for all the controls

981
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
testing is involved but rarely will get

982
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,720
the negative audit report okay stock2

983
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
can have certain issues they can find

984
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
out

985
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
issues i'm not seeing iso 27000 giving

986
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,440
so many issues

987
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,119
but those are the things you should know

988
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
when it comes to the csa because csa

989
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,160
recommends uh iso 27001 cloud security

990
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,319
alliance okay so we should know about it

991
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
quickly shared responsibility model

992
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,760
amazon ec2 amazon vpc i will uh virtual

993
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
private cloud with pc rds emr uh instead

994
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,359
of going into that granular details

995
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,880
understand what's the customer

996
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
responsibility expectations in aws and

997
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,599
what's aws responsibility we already saw

998
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,599
earlier in the earlier particular thing

999
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,760
guys this slides belonged to aws got it

1000
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
courtesy to my friend she shared with

1001
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,240
him so i'm lucky to have it

1002
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,680
in front of you

1003
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,480
so

1004
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
it gives easy snapshot of what are your

1005
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,480
expectation as a customer how you are

1006
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,160
responsible in ec2 rds emr amazon dynamo

1007
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,200
db aws s3 you can study this web all

1008
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,520
those names on the top you can easily

1009
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
google it it's not a secret everything

1010
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,000
is public knowledge guys okay

1011
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
but

1012
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
if you understand what's going on this

1013
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
makes your life easy working with any

1014
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
cloud provider whether it's azure or

1015
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
even microsoft does a very good job at

1016
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,440
it guys very excellent job

1017
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,119
i remember

1018
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
for marathon oil i did a study where

1019
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,400
they told me that they are going to get

1020
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
microsoft among everything i started

1021
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
they give me 2 000 3000 pages of the

1022
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
document only thing i found out that

1023
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,800
encryption keys were not given to us in

1024
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
time they were taking a lag of six

1025
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,280
months and that was a finding that then

1026
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
i don't know things may have changed so

1027
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,119
we had only one issue there saying that

1028
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,119
we don't want email directly going uh

1029
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,680
you know wanted to go to 360 email too

1030
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,560
and we said to them that guys we

1031
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
our ceos or something if they have a

1032
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,320
problem or somebody trying to face them

1033
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,839
or somebody we need to block it

1034
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,680
immediately we can't wait to create the

1035
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
ticket and this then you guys act on it

1036
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,079
can you block it within 30 minutes or 10

1037
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,560
minutes or even immediately sometime so

1038
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,960
there was an issue going on and we were

1039
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
trying to route it through the blue coat

1040
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,119
from our side then it goes to the

1041
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,200
azure side and then we basically so idea

1042
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
behind is that we have a control from

1043
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
our side to block whatever we want to

1044
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,000
block just uh if if you guys are idea of

1045
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,760
what i'm speaking about on network site

1046
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,800
so uh having said that they will give

1047
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,520
you

1048
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,680
turn up documentation

1049
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,200
this whole knowledge is a public

1050
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,440
knowledge if you start going through the

1051
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,920
aws links you will find it i have them

1052
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,000
handy i'll share it with you if you need

1053
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,160
them

1054
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
looking at more customer responsibility

1055
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,480
more security ownership less customer

1056
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,640
responsibility more best practices built

1057
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,599
in

1058
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,359
now i'll go to the next slide which will

1059
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,359
give more idea customers on aws

1060
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,759
controller

1061
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
what does amazon aws supports more

1062
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
security standards and compliance

1063
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,000
certification than any other offering

1064
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
that's a marketing pitch uh including

1065
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,320
this one but they don't do a very good

1066
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,280
job

1067
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,040
they have all sorts of certification

1068
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
attestation support iso

1069
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,359
2700 2701 at 27017

1070
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,680
cloud specific

1071
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
this is this is like cloud specific

1072
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
controls what csa does

1073
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,760
if you guys uh understand

1074
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,880
internationally people uh do not have

1075
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
separate nomenclature rest of the world

1076
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,200
will always speak about uh

1077
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,160
iso 27017 iso 27 uh on the privacy also

1078
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,880
701 or something 27 701 on the privacy

1079
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,119
so

1080
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,680
alignment with frameworks they do align

1081
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,599
very well with the frameworks

1082
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,680
whenever i have anything written here

1083
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,200
guys the information is available on

1084
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
aws anything written you can click it

1085
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,040
here there you will find granular

1086
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,720
information pages after pages

1087
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
laws on regulation privacy they comply

1088
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,040
with lot many laws here but these are

1089
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,720
the main ones that all those countries

1090
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,320
laws and regulation that really try to

1091
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,680
comply with they're doing really really

1092
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
great job here so if you have any

1093
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,480
challenges here this is the slide you

1094
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
need to look at

1095
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,599
i'm on 137 so i'm going to go through

1096
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,640
some of the couple of more uh i'll skip

1097
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,720
this one service level agreement cloud

1098

1100
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,800
uh

1101
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,319
what is the objective to ensure that

1102
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,079
information process transmitted stored

1103
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,920
on the cloud architecture is secure we

1104
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
already taken away security compliance

1105
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,640
let me give you that one

1106
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,400
aws security identity compliance

1107
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,880
solutions

1108
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,119
this is all under identity

1109
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,359
aws identity access management i am

1110

single sign-on organization

1111
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,599
each and everything i have a little bit

1112
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,400
slight to explain but you guys can study

device defender this is all available

1118
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,440
guys you just need to use it to get your

1119
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,960
security bid so

1120
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
before you start putting or creating

1121
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,240
something new

1122
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,319

i have used copperboard amazon vpc is

1126
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,359
one of the best one they will tell you

1127
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,480
guys

1128
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,119
if you ask them it allows kind of very

1129
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,520
structured approach security in buckets

1130
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
i'll quickly go in lieu of time amazon

1131
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,960
detective cloud india dr

1132
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,640
uh there is a link here guys well

1133
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,480
architecture security you can copy this

1134
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
link and you can this from here you

1135
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,079
start you'll get everything let's put it

1136
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,240
that way that's why i put the instead of

1137
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,839
putting link everywhere i put it here

1138
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
how this get aligned to life cycle

1139
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,560
identify

1140
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,720
you didn't take a picture yet

1141
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,400
no it was there for 30 seconds man

1142
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,560
you missed the picture then you missed

1143
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,800
everything

1144
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,200
okay when he keeps the camera down i'm

1145
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
sorry i don't know your name but then i

1146
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,480
know that everybody has done you have to

1147
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,839
follow him

1148
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,920
because i know the first camera comes

1149
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,440
out freeze from him before he want to

1150
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,040
start saying something

1151
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,319
so my timer is with him

1152
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
unfortunately sitting at the back okay

1153
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
aws security service aligned to life

1154
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,599
cycle this is how it's aligned identify

1155
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,160
protect detect so the both two slides

1156
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680
really give the true picture of the

1157
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,160
capability of the cloud guys

1158
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,720
i mean we don't need to go around look

1159
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,200
for the things it's there it's just how

1160
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,919
to use it

1161
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,720
and i'm lucky that i'm actually working

1162
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,280
with mvp there what makes my life easy

1163
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,960
whenever i have a problem

1164
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,760
she just tells me go here look at it go

1165
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
here look at it and you'll find a

1166
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,960
solution and it's uh and i'll i'm open

1167
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,200
here anytime you need anything

1168
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,040
just paying me i'll send you the link

1169
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
immediately somehow most of the time

1170
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,839
it's handy with me

1171
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,240
so what's available under each of this

1172
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,760
in lieu of time i'm not going to speak

1173
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,839
about each area you feel free to take

1174
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,319
your cameras take the picture so we had

1175
00:42:58,319 --> 00:42:59,920
all that under identity access

1176
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,240
management what each of those cognitive

1177
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,160
add users sign up sign in access control

1178
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,319
to your web and mobile apps policy base

1179
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,640
management for multiple aws accounts

1180
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,880
simple secure service for sharing aws

1181
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,440
resources

1182
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,680
detective controls granularly what's

1183
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,160
available

1184
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
one of the important hold on second if i

1185
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,000
can go back

1186
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,160
amazon cloud watch complete visibility

1187
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,920
of your cloud resources and application

1188
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,079
to collect metrics monitor log files set

1189
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,800
alarms automatically react to changes

1190
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,079
this is one of the things which is

1191
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,760
really good

1192
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,160
inspector is good guard duty

1193
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,359
i have used it trail i have used it with

1194
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,400
the flow logs not much

1195
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,359
firewall manager

1196
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
next one

1197
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,000
amazon messi how much time i have here

1198
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
another five seven minutes i'm 141 guys

1199
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,520
aws vpn uh aws vpn is uh

1200
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
a lot of small companies find aws

1201
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
between really really good below 5

1202
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,000
million 10 million people that's really

1203
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,480
really good guys

1204
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:14,079
compliance aws audit manager

1205
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,359
they work with all these service

1206
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,920
companies as partners in different areas

1207
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
different doors there is a established

1208
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,480
relationship with these companies and

1209
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,560
able to give you what you need uh just

1210
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,240
to give the bird's eye view of if we are

1211
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
going to network infrastructure security

1212
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,800
where to look for some help a way to

1213
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,720
look for some ad in texas where

1214
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,319
you probably know all these things

1215
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,240
last two three slides

1216
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,760
your framework

1217
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,520
customer cloud control framework is

1218
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,839
equal to control scenario from aws plus

1219
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,680
your customer enterprise wide control

1220
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,839
service specific controls workflow do

1221
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,160
you agree guys

1222
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,119
yes

1223
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,440
yes so

1224
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,680
this is good this is good this keeps our

1225
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,760
job that's what it is important

1226
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
you know what is workload one what's the

1227
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,520
workload in the context of aws do you

1228
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,119
know what is what workload means

1229
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,359
interesting okay guys

1230
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,599
it's just applications and data

1231
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,160
aws people will use inside word called

1232
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,720
workload to represent apps and data so

1233
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,560
they always use the terminology workload

1234
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,599
there

1235
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,160
associated risk control objective

1236
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,079
so something to brag about after this

1237
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,440
class go outside and ask do you know

1238
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
workload okay if they don't know just

1239
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,280
laugh at them

1240
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,200
okay say you missed it you have to go to

1241
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,040
the class again

1242
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,240
so

1243
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,880
this is common sense guys you have risk

1244
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,359
you have controls uh control objectives

1245
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,400
and controls

1246
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,800
thanks to do you know kosovo framework

1247
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,359
when sarbanes-oxley compliance came in

1248
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,200
they are the originators of this one

1249
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,520
there this is all started from kosovo

1250
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
course of cube guys if the compliance

1251
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,760
cube where the history belongs and they

1252
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,680
have this risk involved control

1253
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,040
objective for the risk and what are the

1254
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,920
controls in war

1255
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,078
i'll quickly go through

1256
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,040
just a

1257
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,720
simple explanation how this can be

1258
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,720
applied you want to build a data like

1259
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,400
with 360v of the

1260
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,920
customer what are what are the kind of

1261
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
the risk involved

1262
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,359
what's the control objective look like

1263
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,359
and what the control will look like just

1264
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,280
a representation of what you saw in the

1265
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,960
earlier slide i think i'm towards the

1266
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,920
close

1267
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,520
end i'm going to

1268
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,359
i'm going to skip this slide this is

1269
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,160
go fast capture log users resource

1270
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,240
activity cloud trail records this just

1271
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,160
gives you a little bit brief about what

1272
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,839
is cloud trail

1273
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,800
what is cloud aws config

1274
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,160
continuous compliance aws config rules

1275
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,640
aws config can automatically remediate

1276
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,480
how the automatic remediation happens

1277
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,640
correct just to give the bird's idea of

1278
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,240
all that what you're seeing so the link

1279
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,839
i gave you i told you to photograph if

1280
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,240
you click that link probably this will

1281
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,000
start sprawling and you can be able to

1282
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,480
reach to all these areas okay

1283
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,000
uh

1284
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,319
i think this is this is more or less so

1285
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,560
i'll quickly go to the end you have any

1286
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,480
question we have another 10 minutes i

1287
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,760
think

1288
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,280
for questions

1289
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,000
no hard question man simple easy okay

1290
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
yes i've been trying for a year and a

1291
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,359
half

1292
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
to get our developers to rotate their

1293
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,079
aws securities

1294
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,920
what they did is when they first built

1295
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,520
the applications

1296
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,680
they hard coded in all of their security

1297
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,480
into service accounts and the

1298
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,920
application

1299
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,599
and some of our keys are like three

1300
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,520
years old that have never been rotated

1301
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,480
and they've checked in to give up right

1302
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,920
get up

1303
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,839
chicken gun yeah

1304
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,920
um but i can't for the life of me get

1305
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,760
them to move to something like secrets

1306
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,359
manager or

1307
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,760
we're afraid of the app breaking if we

1308
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,839
rotate the keys because

1309
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,400
they hard-coded i'm just there they

1310
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,160
admitted to some degree that they've

1311
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,720
barcoded some of their keys

1312
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:09,440
so

1313
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,200
a hard coding of the case husband

1314
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,240
problem i don't know whether you're

1315
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,920
going with any sort of compliance you

1316
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,760
don't tell educate the people and tell

1317
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,040
them what is right tell them that the

1318
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,480
compliance requires it that's the

1319
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
language people sometimes require

1320
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,160
any compliance you speak about today

1321
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,000
whether you go with any framework

1322
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,480
whether you go with the pci or all

1323
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,960
remotely anything related to privacy

1324
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,200
even if you speak about privacy

1325
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,800
you can say that hey this privacy

1326
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,240
regulation if you are in industry

1327
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,280
healthcare hipaa requires some of this

1328
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,040
thing you blame any compliance you

1329
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,520
probably will get more easy output

1330
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,200
if you try to change the people is very

1331
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
difficult sometimes otherwise training

1332
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,160
is another aspect you involve training

1333
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,559
uh involve

1334
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,640
aws people they're really really good at

1335
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
it they will give a dedicated time to

1336
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,640
you guys and conduct a training for you

1337
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,559
that's one thing i liked about it if you

1338
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,480
don't get anything call me i'll get this

1339
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,559
mvp to talk to your people for 30

1340
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,520
minutes

1341
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,359
yeah i'll i call her and i say that

1342
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,440
she's now become a ci software another

1343
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,079
division uh but she's uh she's really

1344
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,160
doing very well very good friend of mine

1345
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,319
here's a quote that i heard today

1346
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,400
to ask your developer team who is the

1347
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,240
contact if this product gets owned

1348
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
tomorrow

1349
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,440
well technically the aws team

1350
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,040
[Laughter]

1351
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,280
they own the product they just don't

1352
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,559
secure it

1353
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,760
even though

1354
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,040
okay so we go back to this place

1355
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,839
if you don't know the owner of the

1356
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,920
application it's very difficult so you

1357
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,599
have a business owner

1358
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,880
and you have a

1359
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,160
you know a since sas even if in sas mode

1360
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,079
you typically will have a business owner

1361
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,240
for the application ultimately the ball

1362
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,720
is always going to be in in the com it's

1363
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,400
on the corporation because see i showed

1364
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,319
you in the responsibility metrics

1365
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,319
correct literally they take a very

1366
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,920
little responsibility towards the

1367
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,839
infrastructure anything about

1368
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,440
infrastructure to more towards the

1369
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,800
application they are really telling you

1370
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,480
are the one responsible

1371
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,160
and they make it very clear from the day

1372
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,960
one so it doesn't matter how you look at

1373
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,960
it

1374
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,720
this is where they all come back to

1375
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
and then once you look at this slide

1376
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,240
they're always going to say customer

1377
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,839
doesn't matter how you're going to do it

1378
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,839
and very common among them they will

1379
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,599
bring it that guys we define from the

1380
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,000
day one once you decide to marry marry

1381
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,119
us this is what you're going to do

1382
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,480
you're responsible for everything

1383
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
and this is another one correct where

1384
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,119
you have responsibilities being attached

1385
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,160
according to ec2 to s3 basically correct

1386
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,760
s3 is commonly for the backup and all

1387
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,359
that ec3 is where

1388
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,799
you have most of the things running

1389
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,559
any other question guys any other

1390
