2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
me there i will honestly say i'm in the

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,080
middle of not one a bankruptcy and a

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
lawsuit so i'm not really responding to

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,480
email all that much these days but if

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,079
you say it's important or you have a

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,399
quick question feel free to send it off

i have to actually read you these

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
disclaimers according to the california

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
bar association

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
if this presentation were legal advice

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
it would be followed by a bill

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
standard lawyer joke

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,160
no attorney-client relationship is

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
formed by the fact that i'm giving you

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
this talk

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,879
and

19

costume

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,840

actually see and i have no idea how ryan

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
reynolds did this for hours and hours

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
and hours so

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
oh wait wait i have a picture i'm having

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
trouble with uh powerpoint again did i

i can click in the middle thank you

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
um this is deadpool i thought deadpool

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,040
was appropriate because we're gonna talk

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
about insurance interns it's all about

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
pools that was my connection i put the

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
costume on this morning

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,920
oh my god it's hot

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
and i can't see out of it so sorry i'm

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
not in halloween costume sorry you don't

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,840
have a

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
female version of the deadpool so let's

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,960
talk about

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
um

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
risk and cyber insurance and also uh one

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
other slight disclaimer as i was

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,119
re-preparing for this i realized that i

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
have stacks and stacks of paper there's

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,880
tons of actual

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,560
minute details and differentiations in

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,120
this area of insurance and law so i'm

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
gonna actually have to refer to notes

56
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,720
and because it would they wouldn't all

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
fit on the slides

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
and if i get something wrong again full

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,440
disclaimer no turning client privilege

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,400
created um i actually was mostly a cyber

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
security professional even though i got

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,959
my jd back in 1995 i didn't go back to

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
it was always like my side hustle right

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,239
okay you're the

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,160
you're the ids biz dev person hey can

66
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
you look at the contract but for the

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
last five years i actually have been

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,920
doing law and

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
this area of cyber insurance is one that

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,640
even i wouldn't touch

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
so

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
most of us have a concept of insurance

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
right and the whole point of insurance

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,120
is to

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
identify the risks that's like step

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,120
number one it's super important that's

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
where everybody who is in software

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
development compliance

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
risk management needs to participate and

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
assist your client or your company in

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
understanding the risk and then

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
on the insurance side we have some

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
methodologies that we can attempt to use

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
to manage that risk and they generally

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
fall into the four categories we can

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
accept the risk that's again where it's

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,080
incredibly important to try to have

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
actual good data facts and figures to

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,879
assess that risks if you're going to

90
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,159
accept it you want to know what it's

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
likely going to cost you

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,159
you can try to avoid it putting in a

93
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,360
mitigation

94
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
or a remediation

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,480
and you can try to mitigate the risk

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,120
through some internal processes controls

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
or you can try to transfer it so

98
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
insurance falls in the area of

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
mitigation and transfer that's what

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
we're trying to do with our insurance

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,239
coverage we're trying to mitigate and

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
transfer the risk

103
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
um

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
now there's also

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
uh just like

106
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
cyber security the insurance world is

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,439
full of its own lexicon

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,000
and it is even to someone who actually

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
knows how to read legal documents it is

110
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,519
highly confusing

111
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
uh the notion of a first party risk

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
versus a third party risk is incredibly

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
nuanced and easy to confuse

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
my shorthand for it and we're going to

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
go into it in more detail

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,798
is

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
first party risks are things that happen

118
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
to you because of you

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,479
and third-party risks are things that

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,360
happen to others because of you so it's

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
all about you know what happens to us

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
but that nuance around because of you

123
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,680
can be very subtle because because of

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
you could mean you chose this vendor

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
instead of that vendor oh my gosh can

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
you imagine if you're in retail and you

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
have a pax point of sale system right

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
now with the fbi knocking on your door

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
okay that's my nightmare fbi knocking on

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,160
my door which did happen to me a few

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
times at first point is actually my

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
biggest nightmare they're nice guys but

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,199
you really don't want them knocking on

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
your door

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
so there are some risks under insurance

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
that you cannot wave transfer and

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
mitigate or avoid so it's really

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
important to understand those and to

139
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,720
know that this is something you're going

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
to have to deal with internally as

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
opposed to try to get your cyber

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,039
insurance provider or your vendors to

143
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,520
help you with and the first one and this

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
is actually we're going to go into a lot

145
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
of detail about this it's a very

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,479
esoteric area of law

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,520
um called work product privilege

148
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,759
and the failure to create the proper

149
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
control group

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
and so if you ever hear work product or

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,479
control group my advice is to leave

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
immediately because you're about to go

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
down a rabbit hole and you may end up

154
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
you know that 24 hours that dan was

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
talking about it's going to turn into

156
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
28 hours in the day you're going to be

157
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,479
working

158
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
and the second area of risk that can be

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
transferred is remediation you can't say

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
but if i make a mistake even if it's a

161
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,680
genuine mistake um you cyber insurance

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
company have to cover my remediation

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,479
costs

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,800
except in a very rare exception

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,759
the insurance company is only typically

166
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
obligated it's a contract principle to

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
put you in the position that you would

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
have been before the incident so they're

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
not going to help pay for all the

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,720
remediation costs that your

171
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
forensics team might turn up as

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,639
desirable

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,319
so

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,479
for most of us in software development

175
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
or in compliance service management that

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
means the cost associated with fixing a

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,600
vulnerability is on you

178
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,280
and

179
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
the cost associated with figuring out

180
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,479
what that vulnerability is might also be

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,919
on you

182
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
so it's not it's important if you're

183
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,120
help trying to help your ciso or your

184
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
general manager understand where you

185
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
think the line is in your risk level

186
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
it's important to really realize some of

187
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,319
these costs are always going to be on us

188
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,599
and that's easy to forget when you're

189
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,360
talking to insurance people

190
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
there's one tiny little exception which

191
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
is that your cyber insurance might cover

192
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
replacement of physical hardware if it's

193
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,080
actually damaged by an attack and

194
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,520
believe it or not this actually does

195
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,639
happen

196
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,440
um

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
it's not

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
in some of the more sophisticated

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,080
attacks we've certainly seen where

200
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,039
people

201
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
figure out what your what your wide area

202
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
nexus access controller is and they'll

203
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
try to either overrun it or damage it

204
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
i've got a case actually right now where

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
that actually probably happened and um

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
this was one area we were able to go

207
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,759
back to them and say no no you need to

208
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
you need to pay to replace that but it's

209
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,960
something we forget easily forget um but

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
it can be it can be part of your

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,120
coverage

212
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,440
okay now here we get into the long

213
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,240
incredibly boring parts of cyber

214
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,759
insurance but they're also kind of

215
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
important to understand

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,560
so

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
i have this giant list of them here and

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,080
i'm going to just give you a couple of

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,360
highlights and

220
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
i think i put these in the notes in the

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
slides so you can refer back to them

222
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
um and if not

223
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
somebody will remind me and i'll put

224
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
them in the notes and the slides all

225
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
refer back to them

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,599
so we have um vendor acquisition now

227
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
vendor acquisition is not

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
the third party risk that you might

229
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
think of under your pci dss it's not

230
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,520
doing third party assessments or

231
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,879
requesting risk assessments from the

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,400
vendors you're going to hire

233
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
this is hiring the people that are going

234
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,440
to help you if you have an incident

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,479
and so that is an example of a cost that

236
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,919
is typically covered under your cyber

237
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
insurance policy

238
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,640
legal representation

239
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
for regulators

240
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,440
and there is a big nuance right now

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
about pci how many people here deal with

242
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,399
pci

243
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,399
yeah there's a big nuance right now with

244
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
pci

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
um because

246
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
most cyber insurance covers

247
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,839
regulatory

248
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
and the representation against with

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
regulatory committees and fines

250
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
so

251
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,560
that would be hipaa is a clear example

252
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,240
if the ocr the office of civil rights

253
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
who is actually the enforcement body for

254
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,000
hipaa comes knocking on your door and

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,519
you need to hire a hipaa specific

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
attorney and then they maybe they fine

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
you that is an example of a regulatory

258
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
service and a regulatory fee you may

259
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,600
have there's an argument right now

260
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
around pci because pci

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
is technically not a government

262
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,240
regulatory body it is a vendor

263
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,360
association there's a recent case where

264
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
the pci

265
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
the piece the pci fines and they do call

266
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
them fines visa calls them fines

267
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,480
where they actually went back and looked

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,279
at the merchant agreement and they

269
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
decided they were assessments

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
not fines

271
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
not covered

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,040
um so if you deal with pci

273
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
very important that you make you let the

274
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
folks know who are dealing with their

275
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
cyber cyber insurance

276
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
um to carefully look at their merchant

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
advance their merchant their merchant

278
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,480
agreements

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
and make sure that they're not they're

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
being tagged as fees not not assessments

281
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
and i don't know who knows what's going

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,880
to happen there um i feel sorry for the

283
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,920
people who pay insurance and think

284
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
they're covered and then end up having

285
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
to pay twice but that's the way the law

286
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
works it's constantly moving um it's a

287
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
marathon not a sprint

288
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,440
uh so uh specific regulatory fines like

289
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
we're all wondering what's going to

290
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
happen with the latest ransomware uh

291
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,959
with colonial pipeline they're certainly

292
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
going to be assessed probably ferc

293
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
um

294
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
a federal

295
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
regulatory energy committee and nerc

296
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,040
nuclear whatever they are they're

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,399
probably certainly going to be fined

298
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,279
under um nercsip and we're going to look

299
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,959
and we're going to we're waiting to see

300
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,800
whether that is actually covered under

301
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
cyber insurance that'll be that'll be a

302
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,360
very interesting one

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,959
notification cost if you have a data

304
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,200
breach or if you have a contractual

305
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,480
obligation

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,399
for notifying you can typically get

307
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
those that's an area of coverage that

308
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,160
you can elect

309
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
pr costs

310
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,160
you can actually

311
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
get a crisis pr

312
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
vendor and they will pay for the cost of

313
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,640
that

314
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
then there's the cost of credit

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,320
monitoring services this has become it's

316
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
become fairly commodity now um but

317
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
almost all of that is usually covered

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,120
under under your cyber insurance

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,760
incident response costs

320
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,399
that's again not your internal ir your

321
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
internal ir is on you your internal

322
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,720
project and reports done with your human

323
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
beings are on you but if you need to

324
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
hire outside ir you can you can have

325
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,600
those ir costs covered

326
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
and we talked about damages to physical

327
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
assets ransomware payouts we're going to

328
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,800
talk about ransomware payouts a little

329
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
bit later in a little more detail

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
because again

331
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
it is whenever there here's a here's a

332
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,800
fundamental principle of insurance

333
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
it's you know it's right back to um

334
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
berkshire hathaway right you want to

335
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
take in more than you pay out well

336
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,160
what's gone up crazy insane

337
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,519
unpredictable

338
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,680
is ransomware is one of those

339
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,279
um and it's been a lot associated with

340
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
the pandemic associated with work from

341
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
home new

342
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,120
and new attack surfaces being opened you

343
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
know people under more stress they're

344
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,560
maybe not being as careful and paying as

345
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
much attention

346
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,959
and

347
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,120
you know kids having access to your work

348
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
computers all sorts of reasons why it's

349
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,480
gone up

350
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,240
because it's going up so much what are

351
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
the insurance companies looking to do

352
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
they're looking to avoid

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
so they're pulling out the fine details

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,560
associated with ransomware payments and

355
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,320
looking for all sorts of ways to avoid

356
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,600
paying on them and we're going to go

357
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
through a couple of those examples um

358
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
later in the talk

359
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
and then lost income so

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,120
um

361
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
these are just kinds of areas of of

362
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,120
coverage that you can look for in your

363
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
cyber insurance there's also different

364
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
policy categories under which these

365
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
might fall so you might think for

366
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
example if you've got general business

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
insurance and you have business business

368
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,240
disruption insurance that oh i don't

369
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
need lost income and my under my cyber

370
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,519
security policy you would be wrong

371
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,760
um because there are

372
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,040
the way cyber insurance works is there's

373
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,399
you know there's underwriting and

374
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,079
there's policies and then there's

375
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,800
exclusions and there's caps and limits

376
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
and all sorts of things and you have to

377
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,760
be very very careful about what is

378
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,480
covered under what and again because

379
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
because of the costs associated with

380
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
this more and more we're seeing

381
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,839
insurance companies actually fighting to

382
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
try to not pay this actually also

383
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
happened in the very beginning oh i said

384
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
i wasn't going to talk about acquire

385
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,360
fraud

386
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
i'm going to say it anyway um in the

387
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
very beginning when ach wire fraud first

388
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
started happening

389
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,519
i did okay wait

390
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
here we go

391
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,399
somebody gets a chocolate bar

392
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
um

393
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
um so

394
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
kate won't eat them it's got sugar in it

395
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,519
so so

396
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
there there's always a fight whenever

397
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,360
there's a new level of

398
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,320
payout anticipated you can expect that

399
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,920
your cyber insurance company is going to

400
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
fight and this is just we had we also in

401
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
the industry when

402
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
you know 20 years ago there may be three

403
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,079
organizations that you could get cyber

404
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
insurance from you know marsh aig and

405
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,800
and one other now there's probably about

406
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,320
60 vendors out there that are

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
writing policies most a lot of the big

408
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
policies are still underwritten by you

409
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
know european

410
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
reinsurance risk category companies but

411
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,760
anytime there's that much competition in

412
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,920
there it gets very fragmented in terms

413
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,199
of the actual underwriting and it's

414
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,040
difficult to understand

415
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,399
what you actually have

416
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
so let's talk a little bit about

417
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,440
network security insurance specifically

418
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
and this is near and dear to my heart

419
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
because i just got my first malpractice

420
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
insurance policy and ninety percent of

421
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,279
the policy language was all around

422
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,040
network security

423
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
and they even asked you specifically if

424
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
you used an exchange server

425
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
and i'm like well i got lawyers yeah

426
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,120
maybe they still do use exchange servers

427
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,680
on prem exchange servers um

428
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
lawyers and government that's probably

429
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
the only place those still exist so

430
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,680
i actually tried to read it

431
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,839
and remember i am a professional i

432
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,040
actually understand cyber security and i

433
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,759
got about halfway through it and decided

434
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
that this was just

435
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440
i wasn't going to buy it and so it

436
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
wasn't worth my time i spent an hour and

437
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
a half trying to read it and i decided

438
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
it wasn't worth my time

439
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
this is an area where the lingo

440
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,360
and the

441
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,759
um specific underwriting clauses can be

442
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,160
highly confusing

443
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
so when we said in the very beginning

444
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,320
there's first party coverage first party

445
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,959
coverage is for causes and events and

446
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,759
actions that you do to yourself

447
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,839
and then there is third party coverage

448
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,480
so third party coverage is when you

449
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,399
think that you might need to protect

450
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,680
someone that your causes actions

451
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,399
might

452
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,440
impact

453
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
so

454
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
if you are

455
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
a um a billing solutions provider for

456
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,120
example

457
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
and you send out a lot of messages and

458
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
you accidentally send malware to one of

459
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
your customers that would be an example

460
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
of a third party risk that would be paid

461
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
for under your third party coverage

462
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,120
the um

463
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
and this is an area

464
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,079
of

465
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
of growing concern especially as the on

466
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
the regulatory side as people are

467
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,399
looking at you know dss and this the csa

468
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,360
start

469
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,440
all looking at how do we how do we

470
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
require third-party risk assessments

471
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,880
from our vendors

472
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
then our third parties are actually

473
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
thinking potentially of coming back to

474
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,160
us if we cause

475
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,279
um

476
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
an accident or an event to harm their

477
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,199
system

478
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,279
and you can get all sorts of coverage

479
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,480
there

480
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
again with that pci dss read the

481
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,119
language very carefully

482
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
make because that is going to be

483
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
coverage for

484
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
um you causing a problem somewhere else

485
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
it may not cover your own actual loss

486
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
breach response is another area that's

487
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,599
there's been um a lot of talk and a lot

488
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
of coverage about lately it used to be

489
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
fairly reasonably priced but the

490
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,559
underwriting is getting much more

491
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,480
sophisticated now so they're actually

492
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
going to go back and look at you know

493
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
what type of data do you have who are

494
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
your third parties it does help

495
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,640
if you have um

496
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
gdpr experience and you've done a true

497
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
privacy assessment and you can show some

498
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
actual data and some actual policies and

499
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
procedures around that you might be able

500
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
to get

501
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
a lower cost or a lower premium but it's

502
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,480
still a very nascent area of law and

503
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
it's uh

504
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
then the coverage is

505
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,559
highly variable except the notification

506
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,919
and the

507
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
and the um third-party monitoring those

508
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
are pretty standard features now and you

509
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
can get them at fairly reasonable prices

510
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,520
um

511
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
and then and then there's like the first

512
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
party coverages that are the more

513
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,559
esoteric components um are you being

514
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,760
extorted

515
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
so and ransomware by the way is now

516
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
sometimes being called out expressly

517
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,440
separately from network instruction so

518
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
network distortion would be a ddos the

519
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
old ddos attacks right you're going to

520
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
have a big game in vegas we're going to

521
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,080
ddos your betting site and that's that

522
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,160
would be considered a network extortion

523
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,760
ransomware because there's no

524
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,760
pre-notification

525
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,840
isn't technically extortion because it

526
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
comes afterwards

527
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
um

528
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,320
so

529
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,080
then there's dependent business

530
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,799
interruption insurance that is if a

531
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
um a third party provider to you

532
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
causes an interruption in your system

533
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,240
and

534
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,679
and of course some system failures

535
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,160
digital asset laws cyber crime again

536
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,410
another area if you are worried about

537
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,799
[Music]

538
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,600
business email compromise or a potential

539
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
malware getting into your system through

540
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,799
a phishing attack

541
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
and you have to look at those carefully

542
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
because they're separating out now

543
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,799
typo squatting

544
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,720
may be considered may not be considered

545
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
a cyber crime it may be considered

546
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
something else so you've got to very

547
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
carefully look and walk through these

548
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,280
scenarios you have in your organization

549
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,559
to understand if it's actually going to

550
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,200
be covered or not

551
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,880
and then there's reputational harm which

552
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,919
again

553
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
and if you're you know if you're l'oreal

554
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
or um a half a big personal brand might

555
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,320
be something that you want to cover but

556
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
if you know that'll depend on your

557
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,840
marketing team in their organization

558
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,160
um i guess the net net of all this is

559
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
it's really complicated

560
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,840
and if you feel

561
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
if you feel like this is something an

562
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
area that your organization

563
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,400
needs and is not um

564
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,320
thinking about carefully it's probably

565
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
worth bringing it up

566
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,480
right now because policies are being

567
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,400
reviewed and drafted there tend to be

568
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,840
you know annual boundaries annual

569
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
contract boundaries so right now is the

570
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
time to bring this up and say hey i just

571
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,039
went to this talk they talked about how

572
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
things are changing like crazy in cyber

573
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,039
security insurance so maybe it's time to

574
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,200
review our policies

575
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
um then just for fun

576
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,880
just so you can sound like an expert um

577
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
you can say really you can use some of

578
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
the the cyber insurance lingo

579
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
so we have

580
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
um all sorts of

581
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
special languages

582
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
business insurance cgnl

583
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,760
um

584
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,440
eno

585
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,320
criminal acts and fidelity

586
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
commercial property and then of course

587
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,120
cyber and you're sitting there going why

588
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,000
if there's a cyber insurance category

589
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,080
are we looking at all of these other

590
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,039
areas of coverage well

591
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,520
because

592
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
you might actually have some remedy

593
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,679
under these

594
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,240
more traditional standard

595
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
clauses even your commercial general

596
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,559
liability and like i said

597
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,360
a data data publication to the dark web

598
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,760
was considered a publication

599
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
and we had and we had a client get

600
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
recovery under a cgnl policy

601
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,919
so don't ex if you're

602
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,919
informing or communicating with someone

603
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
just remind them to go through

604
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,840
everything so

605
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
this is my checklist

606
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,480
um of things that i do when i actually

607
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,559
try to review when i review our tiny

608
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,600
little company's cybersecurity policies

609
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,720
and we deal with financial data and

610
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,039
information so we do actually try to

611
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,799
take this seriously

612
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,919
um

613
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,360
there are

614
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
there are some important aspects of

615
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,320
things like sub limits

616
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
and the new one that's come out that's

617
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
relatively recent is new or should have

618
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
known so you

619
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,159
this is what's important

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,760
in

621
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,320
for the actual practitioners because if

622
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
you have a an application risk

623
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
or a compliance risk

624
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,080
or

625
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
um

626
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,320
internal tech debt that has identified a

627
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,679
cybersecurity risk that ends up

628
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
causing a breach or a liability in the

629
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
future

630
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,679
your insurance company

631
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,760
may have a new or or should have known

632
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
exclusion and you may not get coverage

633
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,840
for

634
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,799
that and this is this is kind of recent

635
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,080
but as we see more and more

636
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
standardization especially coming down

637
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,679
from the federal government

638
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,960
i think it's important as practitioners

639
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,760
that you be aware of this and be aware

640
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,720
of

641
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,159
you know keeping your data

642
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,000
and communication paths all the way up

643
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,919
to the cfo or the finance person whoever

644
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,240
is in charge of this

645
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,159
um breach of contract exclusions they're

646
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,840
i

647
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
really tried hard to wrap my head around

648
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,159
this but effectively

649
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,159
it says it's saying

650
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
that if

651
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
if wow i lost it

652
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
if if your act would have caused you to

653
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
breach a contract if your act or a

654
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,200
mission would have caused you to breach

655
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
a contract then it's not an insurable

656
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,280
event

657
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
so this means that you actually have to

658
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,120
look at your obligations

659
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,360
this happens a lot in in disclosure

660
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,799
requirements for data disclosure

661
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,080
requirements you have to go back and

662
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
look at your obligations and make sure

663
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
that it doesn't conflict with your

664
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
insurance policy

665
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
this sounds like a lot of work doesn't

666
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,840
it who would really want to do this

667
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,799
yeah

668
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,720
nobody fortunately there's professionals

669
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,760
out there

670
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
who can do this for you

671
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
but this is the whole point of these

672
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,200
kinds of checklists are to enable you to

673
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,480
issue spot and identify and bring them

674
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,120
bring things up you know only it's

675
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,520
impossible for any of us to actually

676
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
solve these problems we just need to

677
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,279
make people aware and try to make them

678
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
think about

679
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
whether or not this is important for

680
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,120
them

681
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,200
um war exclusions so you wouldn't think

682
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
you wouldn't think that that would have

683
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,360
anything to do with cyber security

684
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,679
however

685
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,039
um

686
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,520
the their the language that's being used

687
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
now when we talk about some of these

688
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
data breaches in terms of them being

689
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,039
state actors cyber terrorism

690
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,279
there is discussion

691
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,159
that in fact cyber incidents

692
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
may end up under the war exclusion in

693
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,039
your insurance policy so again if you're

694
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,799
at risk for being targeted from a state

695
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,559
actor

696
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,320
then you probably need to look at that

697
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
exclusion provision carefully and make

698
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,400
sure it excludes

699
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,840
cyber

700
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,400
um

701
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,080
territory limitations those are pretty

702
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,320
straightforward and then defense costs

703
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,200
now all of these all of these clauses um

704
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
have

705
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,200
yeah it's a lot of work um all of these

706
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,120
clauses are going to have

707
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
sub-limits deductibles co-limits and

708
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
caps

709
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
and

710
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,279
it's you almost have to make a venn

711
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,159
diagram and map them out and see and

712
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
determine and capping is you have to be

713
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
very careful

714
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
across because sometimes capping is only

715
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
under a single category and you need to

716
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
know if the caps stack

717
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
if you have if you have coverage under

718
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
potentially under two sections of your

719
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,120
policy if it's capped in a

720
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,799
is that a max cap

721
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,400
or is that a cap additive cap or is it

722
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
the aggregate of the max cap and it's

723
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,440
it's very important to actually just

724
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,159
build out in an excel spreadsheet and

725
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
tack this all up and add it up

726
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,720
my strategy if you're ever asked to

727
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,120
opine on one of these is pretty

728
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
straightforward and simple

729
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,600
i started the exclusions

730
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
i write down every single exclusion

731
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,799
and then i try to map that back to the

732
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,559
real world because of course the

733
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,080
exclusions are written in insurance

734
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,360
language

735
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,640
and but mapping that back to what is the

736
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,880
application risk what is the compliance

737
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
risk what is the policy and procedure

738
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
risk um that's

739
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,279
where your knowledge of how things work

740
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,320
is very important because lawyers can't

741
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,480
draft that and these most importantly

742
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,000
these insurance policies are written by

743
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
insurance lawyers

744
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,720
and remember they all still work on

745
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,279
mainframes

746
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
so you can take this from a policy that

747
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
if you ever get involved with it that's

748
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,320
that's the most important thing that's

749
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
where i start

750
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
the second thing that's important and

751
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,279
this is also where you and your teams

752
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,360
are important for the organization is

753
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,039
you want to build your relationships

754
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,600
up front and right now is the time to do

755
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,400
it

756
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,480
a lot of a lot of times when i get

757
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,360
called in on a forensic situation

758
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,679
my hands are tied because the insurance

759
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,840
policy says you must use vendor a

760
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,399
if you have any and this if you have an

761
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,159
existing relationship or a vendor that

762
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,360
you like

763
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
you have to pre-negotiate it now to get

764
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
it on an approved vendor list by your

765
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
insurance company or you won't be or

766
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
you'll have it's not that you can't use

767
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
them it's that you'll have to pay for it

768
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,159
yourself

769
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,440
and

770
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,720
and

771
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,799
these relationships especially if you're

772
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,000
an organ in an area of risk any kind of

773
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,799
financial data health data

774
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
now energy if you're in any of those

775
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,880
sectors that are being targeted you know

776
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
how important it is to be able to work

777
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,120
with people that you know and trust

778
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,559
so explaining to your cfo who those who

779
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,799
those organizations are that you trust

780
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,200
and getting them pre-approved in advance

781
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,559
is critical i actually had to help a

782
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,640
friend to do this just recently

783
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,600
um

784
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,760
they had a ransomware attack through

785
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,520
their cloud provider

786
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,399
and

787
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,120
they this is a large

788
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,200
very large organization

789
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
they had no plan they didn't even know

790
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,399
where to start on the vendor list um

791
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,399
fortunately she had me so

792
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,760
we were able to come up with a quick

793
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
vendor list and negotiate and get those

794
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,279
contracts in place but the challenge is

795
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,200
if you wait until the incident is

796
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,320
happening

797
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,720
then you're making decisions in a rush

798
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,000
and when we and we're going to talk

799
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,080
about privilege and work product in a

800
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
second and i'll show you why it's so

801
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
this

802
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
this and figuring out your exclusions

803
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,480
are the two most important takeaways

804
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,399
from this meeting

805
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,399
build those relationships in advance get

806
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,760
them pre-approved by your insurance

807
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,158
vendor

808
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,279
um

809
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,720
i don't know we probably can skip this

810
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
negotiating tips it's a slide in there

811
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,520
you're probably not going to have to

812
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
negotiate a cyber insurance policy feel

813
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
free to give this to your cfo or your

814
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,880
general counsel if you happen to have

815
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,679
one

816
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,559
and

817
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,600
it is

818
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
there is a lot of horse trading going on

819
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,720
right now i'll just give you the um

820
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,240
what we're seeing

821
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,159
is deductibles are double doubling

822
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,679
so then the level you they're your

823
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,279
threshold deductible especially for

824
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,559
ransomware they're going they're

825
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,080
doubling for sure if you've got a two

826
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
million dollar

827
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
deductible today it's probably gonna be

828
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,159
four

829
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,520
and you're gonna pay two to three times

830
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
as much for it

831
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
that's how bad the ransomware

832
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
business has been lately who knows how

833
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
many average days um your systems are

834
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,480
down in ransomware

835
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,559
i i read i got 21 to 23 but i'll give

836
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,919
you 37.

837
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,000
um so here

838
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
i have way too much food in my house and

839
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,320
i'm traveling so it's coming here

840
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,880
yeah they're healthy sort of

841
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
um

842
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
so if you're going to be down or part of

843
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,679
your system is going to be down during a

844
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
ransomware attack for 21 to 37 days

845
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,320
um

846
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,159
you know what's your backup plan for

847
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,039
that

848
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,480
and

849
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,559
you know we've all i mean how many here

850
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,919
how many people here have ever actually

851
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
done a backup

852
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
how many people have done a restore

853
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,840
right

854
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,919
exactly um even and if you're depending

855
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,480
on your third-party provider your sas

856
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,799
provider to be your backup and restore

857
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,200
person they can show you all the log

858
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,840
data that you want yeah you're

859
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
successfully successfully successfully

860
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,960
successfully you know that is worth

861
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
the cost of the paper to print it when

862
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,520
they can't actually restore it it's also

863
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
one of the biggest challenges with

864
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,559
ransomware attacks is you have to do

865
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,919
incremental restores right because you

866
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,360
got to figure out when the ransomware

867
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,039
got into your system they don't

868
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,799
hit you the same day the malware shows

869
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,720
up in your system you've got to go back

870
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
and find where it is on that restore and

871
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,039
then you've got to be able to do

872
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,679
incremental data updates with avoiding

873
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,279
the executables and that's something

874
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,320
that we've

875
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,360
i'm lazy honestly um my backup restore

876
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,760
strategy is dump the whole drive

877
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
uh if you have to do if you haven't done

878
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,679
a tabletop and plan for an incremental

879
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,760
restore it's definitely something you

880
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
should be talking to your ita teens

881
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,120
about

882
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
now we get into the fun legal stuff that

883
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
all of that was preparation for the fun

884
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,799
part of the talk

885
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,679
um

886
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,320
handling an incident so the very first

887
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,880
thing that you have to do if you have a

888
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,799
cyber incident is form

889
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,480
this is a legal thing form something

890
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,000
called a control group

891
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
if you don't form a control group

892
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,799
anything you say or do will come out

893
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
and control groups are very specifically

894
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,799
defined so this control groups are a way

895
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,559
of implementing

896
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,679
the ability to state to a judge that you

897
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,320
have privilege and work product

898
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,720
privilege and work product are actually

899
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,559
legislative or statutorily created

900
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,519
rights

901
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,320
and they came out of an old english

902
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,919
common law

903
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,279
um

904
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,399
principle

905
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,000
was that a wife could not testify

906
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
against a husband

907
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,559
so when we talk about privileges they

908
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,320
really come up more out of the criminal

909
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,960
law context and they're very restricted

910
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,480
in civil law

911
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
but there's they still do exist so you

912
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
have to be very very careful or you're

913
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,679
going to

914
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,360
break your privilege and your work

915
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
product will become

916
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,760
readily available and

917
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,640
in

918
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,600
the cyber space especially in insurance

919
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,720
where we're mostly talking about

920
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
forensic reports

921
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,799
the law is all over the map

922
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,120
so we have to go to the

923
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,279
the lowest common denominator if we're

924
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,440
going to have any hope of trying to

925
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
protect information that occurs

926
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
during

927
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,960
a cyber incident

928
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,320
the second thing that's really important

929
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,360
um

930
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,559
is that a a lot of policies

931
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,799
have an exclusion

932
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
that coverage does not start until

933
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,080
they're notified

934
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,080
so you have to form your control group

935
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
really quickly which is typically going

936
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,039
to be run by

937
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,120
your your attorney your general counsel

938
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,880
if they're there or your outside counsel

939
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,200
who you're going to hire specifically

940
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
for

941
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,559
this incident you're not going to go to

942
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,080
your general outside counsel your

943
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,600
contracts person or your compliance

944
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
person or your workforce your your hr

945
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
lawyer you're going to hire a specific

946
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
likely separate firm

947
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,559
specifically for this incident

948
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,000
and then

949
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,679
somebody has to know where the policy is

950
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,159
and somebody has to know who to call

951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,640
and you would be shocked

952
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,320
at how many times

953
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,679
especially if the policy's just been

954
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
rolling over

955
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,840
and nobody knows where it is and nobody

956
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
knows who to call

957
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,080
so just like we have you know when we

958
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
have to when we have our call trees um

959
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,320
on our cyber incidents for internal

960
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
communications somebody needs to know

961
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
where that insurance policy is and who'd

962
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
call

963
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,480
and then the vendor selection part of it

964
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,239
and again i mentioned it earlier it's

965
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,520
really important to get those

966
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,119
relationships and

967
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,359
it's october if you have a favorite get

968
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,359
it to your cfo now

969
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,079
it's very important to

970
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
discuss that and sometimes your outside

971
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,239
counsel can negotiate for you

972
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,918
your outside counsel

973
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,679
is going to have to hire the forensics

974
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,879
person

975
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,119
this is the craziest thing

976
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,679
you don't get to hire your own forensics

977
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
team

978
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,199
because that breaks that breaks the

979
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
privilege rules and it'll come out and

980
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
we'll go over a couple of cases and look

981
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
at how the court thought about this

982
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,839
and then hopefully and then there are

983
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,599
terms and conditions around payout we're

984
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,280
going to talk about ransomware and we're

985
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
going to talk about some of the some of

986
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
the exclusions that have arisen in

987
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,239
ransomware

988
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,200
um

989
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,680
and why it's important to

990
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,359
follow to get that insurance company

991
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,280
involved early but to have them

992
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
controlled and managed by outside

993
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
counsel

994
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
so a control group

995
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,440
is

996
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
a limited number of individuals who are

997
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
allowed to communicate under privilege

998
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,720
so privilege covers communications

999
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
work product

1000
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
covers

1001
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
in our

1002
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,880
situation typically forensics reports

1003
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
and analysis

1004
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
covers

1005
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,560
activities

1006
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,400
the work product can you you can all

1007
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
imagine what's the work product every

1008
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,560
person who's about to sue you wants to

1009
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,279
get their hands on

1010
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,880
somebody say it please it's the intern

1011
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,119
yes exactly it's the internal forensics

1012
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,119
report it's your ir report

1013
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,440
and if you've started

1014
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,119
an ir

1015
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,960
investigation internally earlier with

1016
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
your own staff

1017
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,839
that is not privileged

1018
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,760
that's ordinary course business

1019
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
operations

1020
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,800
so if you're on one of those teams

1021
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,119
don't put your opinion in it

1022
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,359
do not write down your opinion just

1023
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,320
state the facts oh this port was left

1024
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
open oh this patch wasn't done

1025
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,880
oh that credential was compromised just

1026
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,560
the facts

1027
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,400
no opinions

1028
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,079
keep those to yourself or to your

1029
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,400
husband under attorney client privilege

1030
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,560
um now if your husband's not an attorney

1031
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,800
just keep it to yourself

1032
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,720
don't be offended if you're not in the

1033
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,960
control group the control group has to

1034
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,040
be a very very very small number of

1035
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
people and it has to be very very

1036
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
limited so it is

1037
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,839
it is very likely that you are not going

1038
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,440
to be in the control group i get ciso's

1039
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
asking me why i want to under the

1040
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,640
control group uh you're not an officer

1041
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
and they don't want you in there um

1042
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,359
probably i'll see you no too much um so

1043
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,119
they don't you're not going to be none

1044
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,320
of us are going to be in the control

1045
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,359
group

1046
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,599
so don't be offended

1047
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,040
and then the other problem is sometimes

1048
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
your organization wants to get ahead of

1049
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
things and they start

1050
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,240
wants to get quickly going on they want

1051
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,200
to start their mitigations and

1052
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,880
remediations

1053
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
and they don't wait until they've had a

1054
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,560
demand

1055
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,680
or

1056
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,599
the anticipation of litigation has not

1057
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,160
yet arisen it's it's

1058
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,200
you know

1059
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,560
and this actually turns out to be

1060
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
important into whether or not

1061
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,599
these this outside forensics report with

1062
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
opinions can be can be covered under

1063
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,119
privilege and the last thing is

1064
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,960
it only works here

1065
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,119
if your data breaches in germany

1066
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,240
sorry if it's in china well forget it um

1067
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,200
we know

1068
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,440
only the united states but you know

1069
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
canada mexico

1070
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,920
no other there's no other

1071
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,599
legal

1072
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,599
framework that we that we know of that

1073
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,280
actually has this concept so

1074
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
you know

1075
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,920
it doesn't mean that it's not good

1076
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
practices and procedures to follow

1077
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,560
uh um a policy around privileged

1078
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,160
communications and a control group but

1079
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
just don't be upset

1080
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
if you get an international

1081
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
um claimant and all of a sudden all your

1082
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,839
hard work goes for nothing

1083
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,119
okay

1084
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,079
so

1085
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,880
uh it's an evolving framework i'm gonna

1086
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
give you two use cases and we'll play

1087
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,960
you spot the difference

1088
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,839
and

1089
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,079
um it does not protect facts and again

1090
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
that's why i said those early

1091
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,440
investigations those early reports you

1092
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
do just stick to the facts

1093
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,079
um

1094
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,960
so here's two recent cases uh one of

1095
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,800
them is capital one we all remember when

1096
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,040
they had that you know open s3 bucket

1097
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
why do people

1098
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,119
put why do people put unencrypted pii

1099
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,200
out there anywhere ever anymore come you

1100
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,920
guys are upset guys isn't it easy to

1101
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
tokenize or mask or

1102
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,640
am i dreaming i always look at those

1103
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,320
vulnerabilities and go how are we how

1104
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,839
are we still doing those how are we

1105
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,680
still having those

1106
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
and then you know really you left an

1107
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,200
open s3 bucket

1108
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,400
really

1109
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
really

1110
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,480
um but anyways capital one did it uh

1111
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
with a whole bunch of mortgage

1112
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,960
applications where people of course

1113
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,320
gladly gave up you know their bank

1114
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,680
account data their social security

1115
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,560
numbers their firstborn's child's name

1116
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,680
and uh

1117
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,079
et cetera but i think it was about 70

1118
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,160
million records that were breached they

1119
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,839
had uh

1120
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,400
60 lawsuits filed in the first month

1121
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,680
so

1122
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,599
what capital one did

1123
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,960
is they hired a separate outside firm

1124
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
the outside firm got a separate

1125
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
forensics company

1126
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,240
they had a specific work scope here's

1127
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,480
another trap if you already have

1128
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
a deal if you're if you're a mandiant

1129
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,599
customer on a retainer

1130
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,280
that ain't going to be privileged

1131
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
anything done at the end of that is not

1132
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,800
going to be work product

1133
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
no

1134
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,000
you have to have a separate one and a

1135
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,839
special one and it has to be written

1136
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,200
specially

1137
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,040
specifically for this incident

1138
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
specifically in preparation for making

1139
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,640
decisions about litigation and

1140
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,319
litigation strategy

1141
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,119
so they had they hired an outside

1142
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,839
specialist firm

1143
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,440
they um the specialist firm hired a

1144
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,359
separate forensics company

1145
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,960
they wrote a specific scope of work

1146
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
they

1147
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,240
they dock signed and marked and tracked

1148
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,000
everyone who got a copy of the report

1149
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,440
so they could show the judge these are

1150
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,720
the only people who had this report

1151
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
and

1152
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
so there were a couple of other factors

1153
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,480
as well

1154
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,240
but effectively the judge said in that

1155
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,520
case

1156
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
we agree

1157
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
this is work product and p prepared in

1158
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,720
advance of litigation they went through

1159
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,280
a 10 step a 10 step analysis there's a

1160
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,040
really good aiken income article linked

1161
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
right there if you're interested in

1162
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,599
reading it now let's compare and

1163
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,160
contrast that with what happened to a

1164
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,760
law firm

1165
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,000
named clark hill

1166
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,079
who has a practice in

1167
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,640
cyber security and breach notification

1168
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
and management

1169
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,880
you would think oh no brainer they're

1170
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,599
going to get it all right

1171
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,680
well you obviously can tell

1172
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,720
i love poking fun in my own industry

1173
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
clark hill

1174
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,400
failed to get their report covered

1175
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,440
for

1176
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,920
for a couple of really important reasons

1177
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,599
and number one

1178
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,319
they did not create a unique scope uh

1179
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,560
instead of work and they did not have it

1180
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
uh controlled they did not control who

1181
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,359
got access to the report some law firms

1182
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,920
that i know now are so anxious about

1183
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,640
this they don't even want these report

1184
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,839
they don't even want to receive the

1185
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,599
reports in writing

1186
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,240
i'm occasionally asked to read the

1187
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,680
report

1188
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,560
over the phone or over zoom but not

1189
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,240
actually deliver a written report

1190
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,960
they're the client not my call it makes

1191
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,880
my job a little bit harder fortunately i

1192
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,160
like listening to myself talk and but

1193
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,960
it's uh you know it's and we're in this

1194
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,880
highly variable but can you imagine my

1195
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
reports tend to be short you know like

1196
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
under 10 pages can you imagine

1197
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,920
going through an actual ir report with a

1198
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
bunch of log data or audit data in it

1199
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,880
over the phone and reading all of that

1200
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
out

1201
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,520
um

1202
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,599
again facts are not protected

1203
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,599
but

1204
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,680
they um but the goal is to try to get

1205
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,720
the entire report covered and that's by

1206
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,160
by its nature it's going to contain some

1207
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,520
facts so clark hill

1208
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,040
a law firm

1209
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,800
that specializes

1210
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,720
in cyber security data breach

1211
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,599
notification and services

1212
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,280
failed to protect

1213
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,680
their forensics report

1214
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,000
as work product and privilege

1215
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,160
the the litigant got access to their

1216
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,480
report and why are these supports so

1217
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,240
important right what are what is

1218
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,599
everybody hunting for this is these are

1219
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,280
civil cases

1220
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,880
they're hunting for evidence of

1221
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,640
correct

1222
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
they're hunting for evidence of

1223
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,720
negligence which is also a term of art

1224
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,960
and in our industry what are some of the

1225
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,880
factors that our people are looking for

1226
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,640
at negligence it goes back to that new

1227
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,400
or should have known

1228
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,760
you know

1229
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,160
were you uh you know were you unnoticed

1230
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,240
was there did microsoft have a bulletin

1231
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,839
out saying maybe you should patch the

1232
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,240
system did oracle did are you running a

1233
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,720
cve program now

1234
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
i and the number of times i have tried

1235
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,040
to explain to attorneys and judges

1236
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,520
that the failure to patch

1237
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,040
is not

1238
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,280
negligence per se

1239
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,200
um and i've done it until i'm blue in

1240
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,359
the face i still don't know that people

1241
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,480
understand this you cannot always patch

1242
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,680
period

1243
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,640
it's

1244
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,440
it's

1245
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,359
every retail industry is already locked

1246
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,280
down on their it now you don't make a

1247
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,440
single i.t change from now until the end

1248
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,400
of january

1249
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
you don't change a port you don't change

1250
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
you don't open up a new firewall you

1251
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,599
don't change a configuration option in

1252
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,440
aws or azure it's a lockdown a critical

1253
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,040
patch comes out

1254
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,760
you're probably not going to do it

1255
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,319
you might try and you won't even put in

1256
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,160
a mitigation you won't even put throw up

1257
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,240
a laugh and try to protect it in line

1258
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,560
with a waff why

1259
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
when does retail make all their money

1260
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,280
right now you got to be on and active so

1261
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,000
there are absolutely perfectly valid

1262
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,280
reasons why you may never patch

1263
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,640
so it's not

1264
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,680
in my opinion it's not negligence per se

1265
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,200
but you have to try to explain that to

1266
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,720
someone and that's where these reports

1267
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,079
come in right they're going to put on

1268
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,560
all the all of the rationale

1269
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,520
why

1270
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,480
what you did or did not do was not

1271
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,640
negligence per se and not

1272
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
um

1273
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,960
so that is very very artful crafting of

1274
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,520
analysis of the facts and crafting and

1275
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,440
you don't want that in the hands of your

1276
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,119
opponent

1277
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,440
um

1278
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,880
okay ransomware

1279
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,880
this is a big topic and we're already

1280
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,880
getting a lot of litigation around it

1281
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,960
actually very sadly

1282
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,680
um the first wrongful death

1283
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,560
due to ransomware litigation

1284
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,359
is going to trial next year

1285
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,960
a hospital

1286
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,119
was undergoing a ransomware attack they

1287
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,599
didn't have the automated monitoring for

1288
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,240
fetal heartbeat and

1289
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,520
a baby

1290
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,760
as often happens more than you know

1291
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,000
happens in pregnancy cord wrapped baby

1292
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,800
went into distress it was missed

1293
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,680
um

1294
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,000
the claim is because the hospital was

1295
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,319
under a ransomware attack and they they

1296
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,400
didn't have enough staff to do the

1297
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,720
individual level of monitoring

1298
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,520
and

1299
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,560
um

1300
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,400
that the individual wasn't told that the

1301
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,960
hospital was under a ransomware attack

1302
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,560
i don't even know that the hospital knew

1303
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,000
at the time the incident occurred that

1304
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,319
there was a ransomware attack so

1305
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,760
but you know this is getting more and

1306
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
more serious right we all know hospitals

1307
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,160
are targeted um

1308
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
you know you read these horrible stories

1309
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,400
of the older nurses having to run around

1310
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,800
and explain how to hand chart vitals

1311
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,200
okay everybody here could do that right

1312
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,040
everybody here could like take a graph

1313
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,079
and put three points on it and trend it

1314
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,520
it's a little bit it's a little bit

1315
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,000
mind-boggling to me that basic skills

1316
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,839
like how to plot and graph on a piece of

1317
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,800
paper is not taught anymore

1318
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,160
um so

1319
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,599
these are these are becoming very

1320
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,160
serious and we're going to see of course

1321
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,680
when bad things happen

1322
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,839
it's the american way to

1323
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,319
um hold somebody else responsible

1324
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,319
we're like the largest country in terms

1325
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,319
of hold somebody else responsible

1326
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,359
so

1327
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,880
we're going to expect more of these so

1328
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,319
if you're involved in one of these

1329
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,660
ransomware situations um

1330
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,400
[Music]

1331
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,240
you've got to think even more carefully

1332
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
than you do in i hate to say it in an

1333
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,119
ordinary you know like pci dss problem

1334
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,160
but you're gonna have to think a little

1335
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,599
bit more carefully and there's a couple

1336
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,000
of other subtle differences

1337
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,280
um

1338
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,920
associated with ransomware you may want

1339
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,079
to have a separate policy for your

1340
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,359
ransomware you absolutely

1341
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,040
need to get

1342
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,920
a lawyer who is knowledgeable about

1343
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,200
ransomware

1344
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,760
specifically involved and we have a

1345
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,680
pretty good one up in dallas named sean

1346
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,319
toombs and you've got to get a lawyer

1347
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,040
involved because

1348
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,640
there are

1349
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,359
some new swizzles so first of all

1350
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,880
there's a case right now that's being

1351
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,040
argued or maybe it'll settle i don't

1352
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
know where the insurance company said

1353
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,400
um because you paid the ransomware

1354
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,359
through

1355
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,960
bitcoin that was a voluntary payment

1356
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,319
we aren't responsible for it

1357
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,000
so

1358
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,760
how much does your and you know

1359
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,880
ransomware you're usually you're

1360
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
completely down you know if it was me

1361
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,079
and i was ransomware i'd go to my

1362
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,760
insurance company and say look i've got

1363
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,240
business uh interruption insurance and

1364
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,760
it's costing me you know a million

1365
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,480
dollars a day so you know you can either

1366
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
pay this 250 000

1367
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,280
bitcoin ransom or you can pay me you

1368
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,359
know my million dollars a day

1369
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,200
but you've got to have somebody who can

1370
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,800
go and make that argument and make sure

1371
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,559
you get it in writing and make sure you

1372
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,760
get um get what you're paying for

1373
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,119
the second thing and this is very new

1374
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,640
is

1375
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
if you get a ransomware attack and of

1376
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,680
course you should involve law

1377
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,720
enforcement and the fbi but if you are

1378
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,000
the fbi

1379
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,520
and law enforcement are going to say

1380
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,200
don't pay it right they don't want to

1381
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
create the the they don't want to

1382
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,400
habituate clients to paying

1383
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,079
they want to not pay we just had a big

1384
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,920
discussion of this in my women's so

1385
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,920
group um you know would you or would you

1386
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,319
not the one gal who was a sister who was

1387
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,160
a former fbi agent of course she was on

1388
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,760
the no pay side

1389
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,559
um

1390
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,240
but you know it's a business decision

1391
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,599
it's a business decision whether you

1392
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,760
make it or not you need to control that

1393
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,440
decision don't let law enforcement push

1394
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,040
you around they should be there to help

1395
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,200
not to hurt but

1396
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,559
um

1397
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,520
if

1398
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,920
you do make a payment and this is really

1399
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,160
hard you have to go check the sanctions

1400
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,440
list

1401
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,880
and that means you're going to need

1402
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,720
somebody who has deep intimate because

1403
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,400
they're all done over cryptocurrency

1404
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,760
right you're gonna have to have someone

1405
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,079
who has deep dark web

1406
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,240
black web knowledge of where that

1407
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,160
bitcoin wallet might actually reside

1408
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,200
because if

1409
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,720
that is going to

1410
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,920
a country

1411
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,599
or a person everybody knows about the

1412
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,359
the sanctions let's write the ofac list

1413
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,800
it's public you can go you should go

1414
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,079
google yourself make sure your names and

1415
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:50,720
accents are on there um

1416
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
if you make a payment to them

1417
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,599
you may not only be denied coverage for

1418
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,880
it you may face federal liability

1419
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,000
and the european union um i can't

1420
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,359
remember i read this but the european

1421
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,880
union has also stated that they're

1422
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,640
creating their own

1423
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,800
um no pay list

1424
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,720
sanctions list so if if you're an

1425
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
international company you're not only

1426
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,200
gonna have to check the us you're gonna

1427
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,960
have to check with the with eu with

1428
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,000
interpol

1429
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,640
so this is rapidly evolving like who

1430
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,920
would have thought we need to check the

1431
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
ofac list on a bitcoin wallet that we

1432
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
probably don't even know where it goes

1433
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,839
um but you do you used to have to you

1434
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,520
least have to show

1435
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,520
that you you attempted to follow the law

1436
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,759
um

1437
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,040
so this brings us back to um my final

1438
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,480
slide which is no before you go

1439
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,119
the

1440
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:46,079
pre-preparation

1441
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,359
just like you do in your regular

1442
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,440
incident planning pre-preparation for

1443
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,599
dealing with your cyber insurance is a

1444
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,960
must

1445
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,040
and unfortunately because of the

1446
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,760
cyclical nature of cyber insurance it's

1447
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
probably

1448
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,119
a must right now because you're probably

1449
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,720
going through that analysis and

1450
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,359
negotiating with them right now so we've

1451
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,599
got a little checklist here for you

1452
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,720
um

1453
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,680
and uh again we're gonna post these

1454
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,960
right kate

1455
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,040
we're posting the slides

1456
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,520
yes we're gonna post the slides so you

1457
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,280
can take it i've got some additional

1458
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,559
checklists in the notes sections um

1459
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,240
hand it off give the whole presentation

1460
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,400
to your cfo my only request is you do

1461
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,160
not ask me to do anything

1462
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
um because a i'm not an expert in this

1463
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,160
area and you really do need an expert if

1464
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,480
you feel like you need an expert i'm

1465
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,319
happy to make introductions but i am not

1466
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,200
an expert in this area and um i'm not

1467
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
answering my emails right now either but

1468
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,000
hopefully tuesday through thursday i'll

1469
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,319
get a little break

1470
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,520
yes yes you do raise your hand if you

1471
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,200
would like a copy of the deck

1472
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,720
okay we will figure out how to get a

1473
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
copy of the deck out yes we can post it

1474
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,319
with the whatever if worst comes to

1475
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,839
worst um you can get it from me

1476
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:16,839
any other

1477
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:21,200
questions who wants to become a lawyer

1478
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,319
but um

1479
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,280
yeah that's at the very beginning

1480
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,040
self-insurance and you may be into

1481
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,440
forced self-insurance um

1482
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,520
as i said earlier because deductibles

1483
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,440
are doubling and premiums are

1484
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,960
quadrupling

1485
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,680
so

1486
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,280
that's that's an internal business risk

1487
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,760
decision and i think you and it's and

1488
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,559
it's

1489
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,559
highly specific and highly individual

1490
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,559
but absolutely we talk about that all

1491
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,240
the time have i got a good enough

1492
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,680
compliance program do i have enough

1493
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,680
understanding of what my actual

1494
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,599
actual risk might be or my theoretical

1495
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,800
risk might be

1496
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,559
in order to self-insure

1497
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,960
if you're a large company like

1498
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,040
a lot of the larger companies

1499
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,800
i know they do that but if you're a

1500
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,319
small company

1501
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,480
and a single incident could take you

1502
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,520
down

1503
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,040
um and

1504
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,880
we know this happens

1505
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,760
then

1506
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,960
figuring out at least you know um

1507
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,720
some reasonable amount of insurance even

1508
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,079
if you're going to be paying you know 50

1509
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,040
60 000 a year for it and figuring out

1510
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,559
some reasonable amount insurance at at

1511
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,839
least let you get this through this and

1512
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,839
try to reset is probably appropriate so

1513
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,000
for small medium businesses i highly

1514
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,280
recommend getting some form of coverage

1515
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,480
um

1516
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,760
otherwise you're going to be calling me

1517
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,680
and trying to have me help you do some

1518
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
forensics reports so you can try to

1519
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,280
blame somebody else and get the money

1520
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,880
from them you're one of your third-party

1521
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,119
providers but that's a long haul right

1522
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,000
you've got to be you've got to have

1523
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,839
enough staying power to make it through

1524
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,280
that entire process which is going to be

1525
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
multi-year

1526
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,319
it's just going to be multi-year

1527
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,000
um unfortunately it's the world we live

1528
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,720
in

1529
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,800
it's it's not it's out of it's

1530
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,040
predominantly out of our control i do

1531
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,319
highly encourage you to think about

1532
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,760
self-insurance but for small medium

1533
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,599
businesses i recommend you know at least

1534
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,760
some at least enough coverage to keep

1535
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,839
you running um for a quarter

1536
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,760
yes sir

1537
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,720
um

1538
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,280
what are some major

1539
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,520
differences in what you present when

1540
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,839
it's applied to say

1541
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,040
not proper estate

1542
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,040
state entities are usually self-insured

1543
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,640
um

1544
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,400
i don't even know if they can get

1545
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,160
commercial insurance for this maybe they

1546
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,640
can some of the sub-state entities

1547
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,799
non-profits there i believe there are

1548
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,880
some specific insurance companies that

1549
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,680
focus specifically on non-profits and

1550
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,319
they try to risk pool so they can offer

1551
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,839
lower premiums

1552
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,200
and

1553
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,280
and i apologize i don't know i don't

1554
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,119
know about state entities i don't know

1555
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,359
if they have the state entity for sure

1556
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:04,480
you should be able to through the

1557
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,640
comptroller's office get access to a

1558
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,559
preferred vendors list

1559
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,200
and if if if you can get insurance i

1560
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,079
would definitely check with the

1561
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,280
comptroller

1562
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,240
yeah

1563
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,359
we've been using before

1564
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,880
we buy our

1565
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,119
yeah you know the ransomware as a

1566
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,319
service

1567
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,559
is you know up and coming

1568
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,440
and that means that

1569
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,839
that means that everybody is you know is

1570
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,920
a potential target right because they

1571
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,760
can spray and play

1572
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,440
against a large a large number of

1573
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,760
domains and usernames

1574
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,839
and you know and i'm still surprised at

1575
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,440
you know nobody in this room would ever

1576
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,599
share a password

1577
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:50,799
with their work environment and their

1578
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,720
personal environment i am shocked at how

1579
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,640
many organizations still don't have that

1580
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,240
as a requirement and then even if they

1581
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,000
do listed in a policy they don't

1582
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,599
actually go ask people

1583
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,520
or they don't give them a tool like

1584
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,920
keeper a lastpass to enable them to have

1585
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,440
strong passwords

1586
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,880
um

1587
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,280
it's it's still back to basics

1588
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,760
so insurance is great

1589
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,000
but remember it's insurance

1590
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,799
make sure you're doing your basics first

1591
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,799
right

1592
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,960
