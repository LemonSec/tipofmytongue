1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:18,560
[Music]

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
uh so it's good to be back at last con

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,600
i don't have the history of a stellar

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,199
gentleman and neighbor of mine jeff

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
williams

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
but i've been in mobile security since

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
that thing we used to all be addicted to

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,040
called the blackberry device

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
so some of you are old enough to

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,559
remember that some of you are young

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,079
enough to maybe have never actually

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,280
owned one

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,680
um so uh i've had the opportunity to

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
speak a couple times over the past half

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
decade on apsec

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,239
and uh have become more and more uh

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,480
active with the oauth mobile project

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,840
that's gone through a pretty dramatic

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,800
update

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,920
uh over the past few years and so um

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
i've been traveling the world was fen

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
and carlos and a number of other folks

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,800
involved in the overwatch mobile project

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,000
really um sharing information on

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,959
uh

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
what's going on with the specs but also

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
general best practices around mobile

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
appsec we've also been doing a lot of

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
work training web apsec people on mobile

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,960
appsec skills

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
so if you don't mind me asking if show a

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
hands how many people have mobile

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,439
experience

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
how many people want to learn about

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,080
mobile

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,119
very good

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
so i'm going to teach you some today and

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
actually show you an asset you can

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,799
access which is academy.now secure.com

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560
um the aus mobile project team is going

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
to be uh sharing it out you'll see the

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
link here in a minute uh it's all free

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
training

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
so a much deeper version of what i'm

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
about to do you can get online it's just

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,520
self-paced it's not like a complex cb

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
cbt it's basically sit and watch a bunch

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
of videos of people who do pen testing

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
all day explaining how to do it

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,320
um and so with that um i have stickers

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,280
if you know about frida and radari so

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
our research teams created them so if

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
you're into reversing you may be using

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,960
frida and radari and uh false positive

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
suck is just a fun sticker so

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
every conference i have a fistful of

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
these feel free to come up and and grab

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
one afterwards so um they seem to

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
motivate the world so

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
i got my start back actually working

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,280
with microsoft on something called sql

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
server

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
so you can guess how old i am i think

64
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,599
there's one other gentleman in the room

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,319
who has a similarly shaded beard as mine

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,319
um and so over that journey i wound up

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
getting i hooked up with blackberry in

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
the early 2000s and have kind of been in

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
mobile ever since

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,519
um and i'm actually a gadget guy so i'm

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
wearing lots of biometric technology too

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,280
some of which we've actually tested so

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
i've got an aura ring on my finger which

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,720
if you've heard i've seen one of these

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
the nba was using this during covid

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,160
measures your temperature and your

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
health and other stuff i can't live

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,680
without my apple watch

79
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,599
i also have diabetes so i'm wearing a

80
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,360
device for that as well medtronic

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,160
happens to be one of my customers so

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,400
now i am a

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
technologist but i am not a pen tester

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,800
and one of the things that i've learned

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,159
in my journey is there's a big

86
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,159
difference between those two so while i

87
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
can pontificate on security architecture

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,920
i'll answer the questions of yours that

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,159
i can but i'm not a practicing pen

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,440
tester because those people are way

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
smarter than i am what i do however is i

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
do help build specs and strategies right

93
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,760
so that's kind of the side where it is

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
and way back when i was working on sql

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
server i helped write nc sql 89 and nc

96
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
sql 92 for any of you ever done database

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,239
work and tried to work with 10 large

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,920
database vendors like elephants in the

99
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
room that's kind of what it's like uh

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,920
the good news is that owasp is a lot

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
more friendly

102
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
um so we work with lots of companies my

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
marketing people make me say that uh now

104
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
secure has mobile products and solutions

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,239
they're really cool and there's a bunch

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,080
of free training uh out there available

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
as well a lot of organizations use our

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
open source tools there are commercial

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
tools for testing and

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,959
feel free to take advantage of those

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
um so i'm going to talk about mobile

112
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
apps i can show you some mind-blowing

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,439
stories i think jeff williams this

114
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,599
morning talking about how the average

115
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
website has like 30 vulnerabilities is

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
true i will show you the scary stats for

117
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,840
mobile you probably never saw

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
going with that i'm going to talk you

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
through the highlight reel of the mas vs

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
and how to think about if you're a web

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,680
pen tester what do you need to

122
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
understand to to move your way into

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
mobile um we actually are also working

124
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
on a second project so jeff this morning

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
talked about labeling well the precursor

126
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,478
to labeling is software below materials

127
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,399
and so there is an os project that got

128
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,918
started late last year it's called

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,400
cyclone dx it is an s-bom spec i'm going

130
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
to touch on that a bit

131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
we're also doing a ton of work around

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
mobile apps connected to iot

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
um of which i'm betting some of you have

134
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
some and others of you are scared of

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
them because they are so insecure

136
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
um so there's an organization called io

137
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
xt and we actually worked with owasp to

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
take the masves and turn it into a

139
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
certification program for iot devices

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,840
and mobile apps connected to iot and i'm

141
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,639
going to show you a little bit of that

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,240
as well and then there's links to lots

143
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
of stuff at the tail end here so i talk

144
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
fast there are a ton of slides um on my

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
linkedin i will post a link to the

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
slides uh you can also just hit me up

147
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,160
over email or any other things so

148
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
um did you know

149
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
that in the last 18 months uh apps like

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
british airways and walgreens and uh the

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,600
mercedes mini car app

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
and uh you may have heard about the

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,320
small apple problem with imessage in the

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
nso

155
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,360
five zero days

156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
and things like that and so i guarantee

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
you you have breached or breachable apps

158
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
on your mobile device right now that

159
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
doesn't mean you're going to run out of

160
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
the room and burn your phone the reality

161
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,479
is if you're doing web security you

162
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,000
already know they're out there the

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,080
question is how many are they how bad

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
are they how severe are they what's

165
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,759
their cvss score their exploitability

166
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,919
and all the rest and so there's this

167
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,560
presumed security about mobile in many

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
instances and it's fascinating i'll meet

169
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
with executives in say a fortune 100

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
company and start talking about their

171
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,039
security and controls that they have in

172
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,720
place for the web perimeter and they'll

173
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,319
be big and investing and we spend

174
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,680
millions of dollars on it and all that

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,120
stuff and then i'll say what are you

176
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
spending on mobile and 99.99 of the time

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
so be like i don't know we don't

178
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
prioritize it right

179
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,039
and so that then leads to some

180
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,560
interesting conversations that are why

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
so many of these things are actually

182
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,759
breached so we have a tool that scans

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
the apple app store and the google play

184
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
start and it benchmarks

185
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,840
for security and privacy vulnerabilities

186
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
about four million to five million of

187
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,520
the apps some of them are you can't scan

188
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
with automation for various reasons

189
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
the sad news is that 85

190
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
of those apps violate one or more of the

191
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
os mobile top 10. 75 percent of them 70

192
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
75 percent of them haven't updated it

193
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
yet uh would violate gdpr if somebody

194
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
chose to look at it from an enforcement

195
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
perspective so um like many other things

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
we see on web mobile is not the greatest

197
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,639
thing in the world and i think

198
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
everybody's aware this last session in

199
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
here about supply chain i mean the

200
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,840
supply chain buttons are off the charts

201
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
we often find both in our automated

202
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,360
testing and our pen testing that at

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
least half of the volumes in an app are

204
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,280
because of supply chain issues either

205
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
improperly configured not necessarily

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,080
malicious just really bad stuff so

207
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
um so if you actually want to learn

208
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,880
about how bad or good the app store apps

209
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,400
are there's two resources for you the

210
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,280
one on the left is actually takes our

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
app store benchmark and abstracts the

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
data so we don't do a thousand

213
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
responsible disclosures at once

214
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
so you can log in on the left side and

215
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
see the top couple hundred apps in each

216
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
of the app store categories to give you

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
a sense of how good or bad they are what

218
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
i will actually tell you is almost all

219
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
the groups are about the same which is

220
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,400
mediocre

221
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,120
um we score apps on a risk scale that's

222
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,440
just like you went to school so 90 to

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,960
100 in a 80 to 90s a b 70 to 80 is a c

224
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
as a broad range the top 5 000 most

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,479
popular most used apps in the app store

226
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
score about a 68

227
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,000
just to give you kind of order of

228
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,479
magnitude right so it's almost 70 so

229
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,319
it's almost a c

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,319
um so the one on the right is actually

231
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
breach tracker one of our um

232
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
one of our enterprising younger

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,520
employees kind of had built this

234
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,759
intranet site that was tracking breaches

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,840
and we just turned it on to public so

236
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
you can see it so this isn't every

237
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,960
breach on the planet this is if it makes

238
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
the news we have a harvester that finds

239
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,720
them and adds them to it so it may or

240
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
may not be perfectly up to date but if

241
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,000
you're looking for evidence to talk to

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
your peer group or talk to your boss

243
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,879
these things are helpful to kind of help

244
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,960
them understand where the mobile risks

245
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
are so

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
if you come from the website of the

247
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,400
house

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
imagine a world where there's no browser

249
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
controls imagine a world where there's

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
no browser sandbox imagine a world where

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,640
the developer has to understand how to

252
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
do storage securely

253
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
imagine a world where the developer has

254
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,640
to write their own cert pinning

255
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,919
libraries

256
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
the reality is that in the mobile world

257
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,560
it's more complicated than web because

258
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,279
your mobile device is a non-trustable

259
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,320
asset

260
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
and so whereas you might put 90 percent

261
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,839
of your

262
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
web code behind a firewall and all your

263
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,200
layers of protection and just a little

264
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
bit's coming back and forth in the

265
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
browser the reality is that 70 80 90 of

266
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
a mobile app may actually be on the

267
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,680
device

268
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
and with tools like frida and radari the

269
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
stickers that i have i guarantee you i

270
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
can reverse your app it doesn't matter

271
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
how good your anti-tampering is we can

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
reverse it right and so your app's going

273
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
to go into a hostile environment most of

274
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
the time developers don't understand

275
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
that their app is running in a hostile

276
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,080
environment most of the time security

277
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
architects don't understand the app's

278
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,519
running in a hostile environment and

279
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,760
that's how we wind up with a lot of

280
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
attacks occurring on that side of the

281
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,080
house

282
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
many language you've got all that other

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
stuff in place

284
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
so you need to think about testing on a

285
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
real device as well the first generation

286
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
testing tools for mobile that weren't

287
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
manual pen testing tools that were

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
automated were running on emulators and

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
what actually happens is when your apps

290
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
go through the app store approval

291
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
process with apple and google they

292
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,959
actually change them a little bit and

293
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,399
then they wind up going to the app

294
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
stores and then they're drm down onto

295
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
your device and so what often happens is

296
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
even if it worked fine in staging when

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
you get it into prod its behaviors may

298
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
be slightly different and so you want to

299
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
make sure you're monitoring what's going

300
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,040
on in prod as you go through the app

301
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
store process as well and so a quick

302
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
class right so i sort of said this right

303
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
you can leak or attack on the device but

304
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
a mobile app also typically includes

305
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,480
cloud services in the back end

306
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
infrastructure and so while we do mobile

307
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,560
application security testing we don't do

308
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,279
web

309
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,640
we make sure that we still look at the

310
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
back end we make sure we still look at

311
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,839
the network services now that's not the

312
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
same as you having a full-blown api sec

313
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,600
you should have one of those if your

314
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,519
websites in your mobile apps are using

315
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,519
the same back-end apis that's awesome

316
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,320
because that means you're already

317
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,160
hammering them in another way so the

318
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
only thing you really have to pay

319
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
attention to is the mobile side because

320
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,399
you're already getting it to kind of

321
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,320
venn diagram the other types of testing

322
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,519
you're doing

323
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
now we um for years have been publishing

324
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
this uh uh mobile attack surface there's

325
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
a way more complicated version of this

326
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,760
on our website and you don't have to

327
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,040
understand all of them but this is to

328
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
kind of give you a way to think about

329
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
framing the problem right what's going

330
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
on in my code what's going on with data

331
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
at rest and storage on the device what's

332
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
going on with transport and data in

333
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
motion over the network what's going on

334
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,200
at run time and the characteristics of

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
run time on those mobile devices

336
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
especially as os versions change and

337
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
library dependency changes and then the

338
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
back end obviously that they're talking

339
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
to so when you think about how you're

340
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,079
going to go actually attack the attack

341
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,399
surface you want to think about how am i

342
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,160
protecting my code how am i protecting

343
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,240
the data at rest right the data in

344
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
motion and the api back end now what

345
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
you're going to see when i get into the

346
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,680
mas vs is these are a couple of the core

347
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
areas that mas vs focuses on

348
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
as part of the strategy

349
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,399
so i'm going to walk you through a

350
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,480
highlight reel of the mas vs but i'm not

351
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,240
going to read it to you it's about that

352
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
thick if you print it more importantly

353
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,279
i'm going to tell you the five things

354
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,600
that matter in the entire book and i'm

355
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
going to do that through the lens of

356
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
where are the most common

357
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
vulnerabilities found in production and

358
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
so if you think about that right you

359
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,160
want to know where the bad guys go or

360
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
where the frequent frequent failure

361
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,680
patterns are so you can focus your work

362
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,639
and that's where you want to develop

363
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,160
your skills and have your pen testing

364
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,519
program focus on those certain areas so

365
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,240
uh jumping over it uh here's the project

366
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
um the interesting thing about the

367
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
project is when i first got started the

368
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
top 10 was kind of the focal point and

369
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
the top 10 was very coarse-grained and

370
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
so the m-a-s-v-s is really the bible to

371
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
get started

372
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,720
not to be religious but it's a place to

373
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
get started the other great thing is we

374
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
advise clients get your architects and

375
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
your senior development leaders to

376
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
actually read the masvs or the crib

377
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
sheets that are created around the masvs

378
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
it will help them understand the

379
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
fundamentals of what mobile architecture

380
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
means from a security perspective and

381
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
that will improve their ability to

382
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
design and build things the mstg is the

383
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
very very long version of what are all

384
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
the tests that map to everything in the

385
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
msvs and yes there is an excel

386
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
spreadsheet you can download that has

387
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
all the line items in it so the reality

388
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
is that it's not actually possible and i

389
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
haven't seen anybody who's got a testing

390
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,240
program that does the entire mstg

391
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
it was an academic approach to model

392
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
everything you could test but don't feel

393
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,440
bad if you can't test at all and i'll

394
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,959
hit on a few of those things as i go

395
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,160
through here

396
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,639
now as you would do in a threat model

397
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
conversation for web infrastructure you

398
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
need to think about what kind of app do

399
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
i have what data is in it what ip is in

400
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,320
it what transactions transpire and so

401
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
there's an organizing principle here in

402
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,800
the mas vest that starts with four boxes

403
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
that i'm going to build

404
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
so the first one is basically your basic

405
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
app you're probably going to spend a

406
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,600
basic amount of time testing it as well

407
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,519
if at all so let's say i've got the

408
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,920
webmd healthcare app it's got no pii no

409
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
transactions there's no account you're

410
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,240
just looking up information if i'm webmd

411
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,680
i probably care a little bit about

412
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
people putting bad data up there but

413
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
there's no liability because there's no

414
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
contracted relationship with anyone who

415
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,519
uses it so actually if you talk to webmd

416
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,279
guys they don't have any security team

417
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
and i could show you the rd we did and

418
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
it would make you cry

419
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,560
now

420
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
level two is the apps that matter right

421
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
so level two now i've got regulate

422
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
regulated data so if you're a bank and

423
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,959
you're doing financial transactions

424
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
you're automatically in l2 uh if you're

425
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,120
a retailer and you have pci you're

426
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
automatically in l2 uh and so on and so

427
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
forth and so um like a healthcare weight

428
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,199
monitoring app right so i have one of

429
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
those on on my thing i've got one of

430
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
those wi-fi scales at home and it tracks

431
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,120
a bunch of my health data right now

432
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,399
you've got to care about that health

433
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,079
data so there's certain protections i

434
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,040
want to have in place and therefore

435
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
there's certain testing strategies

436
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,440
now resiliency is something that we

437
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
don't usually talk about in the web

438
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,279
world so much but is critical in the

439
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
mobile world which goes back to that i

440
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
can reverse almost anything

441
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,199
and so because that binary is running in

442
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,639
the wild on the device where it can be

443
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,000
attacked you need to think about

444
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
resiliency strategies for what can i do

445
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
both from an application design and

446
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,639
architecture side as well as an app

447
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,639
hardening side of the house and so i'm

448
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,000
going to show you some examples of that

449
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,519
as we go through it so

450
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
maybe i have a medical formulary app now

451
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
the medical formulary app doesn't have

452
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,560
pii or patient information in it but it

453
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
does have recipes for drugs that if

454
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
somebody manipulated that it could kill

455
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
someone so you want to make sure that

456
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,560
the drug recipes are accurate right so

457
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,160
i'm going to make it resilient i'm gonna

458
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
design it in a way and test it in a way

459
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
i can make sure someone can't manipulate

460
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
the formulary to create a bad drug mix

461
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
that could kill someone right

462
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,440
sorry i'm on the kill thing um and then

463
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,519
this is really where a lot of the the

464
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
more important things right so so uh

465
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
i'm not currently wearing it by my

466
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
insulin delivery app that talks to the

467
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
thing on my body that injects insulin

468
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
could kill me if somebody did the wrong

469
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,160
thing and injected too much insulin

470
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,000
right so i use the healthcare thing

471
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,040
because that usually gets everybody's

472
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,320
attention right because it really is

473
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,079
kind of life for death world and we're

474
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,639
doing a ton of work uh with medtech

475
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
world you know covet has driven an

476
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
explosion in the med tech side of the

477
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
house that was kind of coming his

478
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
rolling thunder and so i think this

479
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
finds a fun way to do it so standard

480
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
security best practices now i need

481
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
things like hardening against lost

482
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
device i need to think about things like

483
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,199
start fit pinning and multi-factor off

484
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,519
uh and any other risk controls on the

485
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,680
left over here now i need to harden it

486
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
so things like device binding

487
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,199
obfuscation anti-tampering

488
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
british airways for example the british

489
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
airways app was um breached in 2018.

490
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
you may have seen it on the news about

491
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,959
380 000 records they used a mobile app

492
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,120
to figure out how to attack the back end

493
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,000
and then they went and they attacked

494
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
back in they got the records passports

495
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
credit card information the whole nine

496
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,600
yards um the interesting follow-up story

497
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
on that was 18 months later they were

498
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
the first gdpr fine in europe for 180

499
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,920
million pounds their share price dropped

500
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
32 percent because of fine not just the

501
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,839
breach

502
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,920
um and so the reality is you know these

503
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
these things kind of matter and one of

504
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,720
the things they've done in their

505
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
architecture now is they do device

506
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
binding so when you download the app

507
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
it's actually going to hash not only

508
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,079
your account information but the

509
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,600
fingerprint of the device and it won't

510
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,199
run anywhere else and that helps them

511
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,639
with an anti-tampering strategy so

512
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,000
there's lots of things you can do around

513
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,959
there

514
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,959
so the mas vs is basically eight

515
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,880
components to it some of them are the

516
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
tests and some of them are the strategy

517
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,360
so

518
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
be a good threat modeler right if you

519
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,880
and your team don't have good threat

520
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,120
modeling skills do it uh actually we're

521
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,720
collaborating with the security journey

522
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,560
guys uh and putting together threatmod

523
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,680
in class very specifically for mobile um

524
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,279
from that perspective and they have some

525
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,400
speakers here

526
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
um data storage crypto authentication

527
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,919
assessment management network

528
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,520
communication environmental interaction

529
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,319
code quality resiliency now if you're

530
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,319
used to like the api sec list or the web

531
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
uh sec list uh for owasp you'll notice a

532
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
lot of these are different

533
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
right and they're different because of

534
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
the architectural nature of mobile apps

535
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,720
not because of every you know we felt

536
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,319
like making them different

537
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
and so what i'm actually going to do is

538
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
talk to you about where to focus based

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
on where the bad stuff is right so this

540
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
is sort of begin with the end of mind so

541
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
we're going to start with data stored in

542
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,160
an insecure location this is the worst

543
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
offense we find in virtually every

544
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,240
application when you benchmark the app

545
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,120
stores about 50 of all apps in the app

546
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
stores that we analyze have insecure

547
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,160
data storage in some way shape or form

548
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
as a general rule

549
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,919
developers are used to having control of

550
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
the asset where the data is stored

551
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
because they're used to having a

552
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
firewall or a server or something behind

553
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
it right well that doesn't happen on the

554
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,600
device so you need to understand that so

555
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
on inside of the masvs there's two areas

556
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,919
to focus which is data storage privacy

557
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,600
and crypto

558
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
on each of these slides you're going to

559
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
see tons of links

560
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
so these are links to the repo details

561
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,960
so the git repo details in v2 and v3

562
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
there are also links to apple and google

563
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
documentation as well strongly recommend

564
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
that if you're going down this path read

565
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,360
the apple and google documentation it's

566
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
actually getting to be quite good in

567
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
terms of its own training ability to

568
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,640
help you understand the other thing

569
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
about it is it's written for developers

570
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
so the asset you can give to the

571
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
developer is here read this

572
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
in the apple documentation or read this

573
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
and the android documentation about how

574
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,080
to do it

575
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
um so there's lots of different ways you

576
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
know that can be attacked so i'm going

577
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
to dig into this a little bit more

578
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
now each of these five areas i'm going

579
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
to go through have this set of boxes as

580
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
well and again i'm doing the highlight

581
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,160
reel not the half day training here

582
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
so best practices for secure coding

583
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,240
that's for the dev side of the house and

584
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,320
then the best practices for testing is

585
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,799
for the testing side of the house right

586
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,360
so the number one piece of advice is

587
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
don't collect it don't store it ever

588
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,559
there is no reason to store almost

589
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,039
anything on the device assume the device

590
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
will be reversed breached your data will

591
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
be disassembled decompiled uh and found

592
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,840
right you know and developers love to

593
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,039
harvest data oh i'm going to collect

594
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,240
some of this and some of this and some

595
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
of this and some of this and i'm going

596
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
to write it off to a log and so on and

597
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
so forth and so that's that's the

598
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,160
biggest event

599
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,679
there's a lot of stuff stored on

600
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,280
encrypted

601
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
or permissions on the file are set to be

602
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
anything on the device can get access to

603
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
the file which is also pretty bad

604
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,720
uh android a few years ago three four

605
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
years ago came up with scoped storage so

606
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,960
android scope storage uh binds the

607
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,039
application to any of its file stores

608
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,799
and so it ties them together with a

609
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,200
common key so you can't get at the files

610
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
and that's an easy thing it's a binary

611
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,960
test go look in the app does it say

612
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
android scope storage yes or no

613
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,720
basically so if they set the flag to

614
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,559
true then that's going the android

615
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,840
operating system is going to handle a

616
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
lot of that security communication and

617
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,159
bindings between the app and the files

618
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,080
uh the other place we find a ton

619
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
especially recently is

620
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
ip or other sensitive data in the actual

621
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,640
query strings here's what happens

622
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,480
they'll use the mobile app they'll

623
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,240
monitor the network connections they'll

624
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
see the query strings and then they'll

625
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
use them to brute force the back end on

626
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,080
a real machine not a mobile app right so

627
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,919
be careful in query string

628
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
construct

629
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
so testing for credentials obviously

630
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,000
right look in the log files as well we

631
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,080
find a lot there

632
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,679
if you're used to using your device if

633
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,440
you do that swipe between apps you'll

634
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
notice that you know an app moves in the

635
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,320
background and one moves in the

636
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,480
foreground well that data is live

637
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
the data is live in memory when you do

638
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,520
the swiping across apps right so you get

639
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
an event queue from the device that can

640
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,640
tell you your app's moved into the

641
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,919
background you should clean up your

642
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,000
memory in your screen as well if you use

643
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
like a banking app you'll notice when

644
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
you put it in the background the screen

645
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
will switch over to their logo or some

646
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,159
blank oriented thing that's because

647
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,840
they're protecting you so there's

648
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
tooling that can be used to find what's

649
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,559
in that background you don't want to

650
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
have that kind of happen

651
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,919
um crypto is another train wreck i'm

652
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,120
going to handle crypto some more in a

653
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,200
few minutes and then the other thing is

654
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,159
really

655
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,520
if you want to protect yourself make

656
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
sure the device has its own device

657
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
password right because that prevents bad

658
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
guys from finding a device and getting

659
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,240
into it

660
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,000
so there are easy api calls on ios and

661
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
android to make sure that the device has

662
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,760
a password and the app won't load

663
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
without it or the app will give an error

664
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
message that way so

665
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
uh networks number two and you're going

666
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
to find it's very close because it's 48

667
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,960
right so

668
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,559
and we'll take a look at network

669
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,240
issues here in just a second right and

670
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,679
if you think about

671
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,039
most application developers if they're

672
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
building a web app the infrastructure

673
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,919
with ssl and 2a tls and so forth is

674
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,159
taking care of a lot of the comms on a

675
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,280
mobile app they have to write it

676
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,559
themselves and talk to an end point in

677
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
the back end and so

678
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
that's where you wind up finding lots of

679
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,159
issues so

680
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,679
as i mentioned earlier third-party

681
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,600
libraries can be guilty of this

682
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
we were working with a particular

683
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,880
very large organization that has tens of

684
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
millions of users of their portfolio of

685
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
apps we discovered that they were using

686
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
a third-party library that was

687
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
harvesting a little bit of pii so it was

688
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,679
harvesting the um the device mac address

689
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,320
and uh their geolocation and collecting

690
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,600
that data

691
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
which was a nuisance shouldn't be doing

692
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,559
that right and oh by the way they were

693
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,120
transmitting it over http

694
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,799
which meant if somebody knew how to

695
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,640
intercept that they were now collapsing

696
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,159
a lot of information that's likely what

697
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,640
a nation state would use uh to monitor

698
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,799
users at wide scale so there's things

699
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
out there right don't assume a vpn is in

700
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,840
place so make sure there's uh you know

701
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
security across the line so

702
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
um in terms of working with developers a

703
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
lot of it has to do with if you're

704
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
really an l2 plus r you should be using

705
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,799
cert pinning if you're not you don't

706
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,840
have to

707
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,559
um and cert pinning is is generally a a

708
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
bit of an education for developers to

709
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
learn how to

710
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
uh encode an application the right way

711
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,240
using apple trust kit or something else

712
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
and then you have to understand how to

713
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,039
test it the other thing is when you test

714
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,840
cert pinning test it with invalid certs

715
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,240
self-signed inserts other kinds of certs

716
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,159
uh the bad guys know how to do that in

717
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,600
brute force and they will find a way

718
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
through if the syrup painting wasn't

719
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
implemented correctly so it's not just

720
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,640
that it exists it was done right

721
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
the really good news is that seven years

722
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,080
ago six years ago apple came up with ats

723
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,480
which is app transport security you will

724
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
find that some 70 80 percent of ios apps

725
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,039
disable app transport security and write

726
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,640
their own network communication

727
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,679
protocols if you use ats that will give

728
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
you a secure tunnel

729
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,159
by default and so we encourage people to

730
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,159
look for that it's another binary item

731
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,640
you can find it's either on or it's off

732
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,919
within the environment now if it's off

733
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,039
that means they have to make their own

734
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,400
compensating controls and build their

735
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
own secure network connection

736
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,559
uh android has android network security

737
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,200
uh configuration that came out three two

738
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,039
three years ago i keep losing years with

739
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
covid so let's say three years ago

740
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,520
um and that's sort of a similar thing

741
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,799
and helps you lock down the network

742
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,400
connection as well again we find a

743
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,039
number of organizations don't do that so

744
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,559
the other really important thing that we

745
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,760
find in in working with clients is um

746
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
show a developer what a man in the

747
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,799
middle attack actually looks like on an

748
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,320
insecure connection

749
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
99 of them will learn from that never

750
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,880
let it happen again they don't

751
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,120
understand what that is if you say oh

752
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
this could be man in the middle of their

753
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,000
intercept that they don't understand it

754
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
showing it with their own code or one of

755
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,919
the crack me apps from the os project

756
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,440
can can really be revealing that's one

757
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
of our top behavior changers we we have

758
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
found

759
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
and then obviously you're looking for

760
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
ats and nsc when you check it look at

761
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,360
the third party library is there another

762
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,440
place where your data may be transmitted

763
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
somewhere to a third-party service in an

764
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
insecure way it could be the developer

765
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,400
didn't configure it correctly or it

766
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,000
could be that their library doesn't work

767
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,120
properly

768
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
some libraries you will actually need to

769
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,720
turn on a secure connection and tell it

770
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,440
to use https or tls tunnel or what have

771
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,279
you

772
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
third one is off the good news with off

773
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
because i always want to have in the

774
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
middle of something happy the happy news

775
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,480
is that most apps are good at

776
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,640
authentication uh which is a good thing

777
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
as well um so it's one of our lower ones

778
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,480
it's always kind of a fun surprise to

779
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,919
tell people about it that means they're

780
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,440
they're they're

781
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
that doesn't mean there aren't problems

782
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
with it but there's some really good

783
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
documentation from apple and google and

784
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,640
we're excited to see that most folks do

785
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,919
this the right way um and so as as a

786
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,320
focal point you know if you think about

787
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,919
the the rate of code changes in your app

788
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,520
rarely does a team change your

789
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,799
authentication

790
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,400
so once you've got it well tested and

791
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,080
hardened a lot of what we advise clients

792
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,679
to do is just pay attention is the code

793
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,360
changing or not are there flags in your

794
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
system can you set up flags and controls

795
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,039
in your system so that you and security

796
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,480
get an alert

797
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
when anybody changes a lick of code

798
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,760
anything related to authentication or

799
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
crypto so

800
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
there's a bunch of things around doing

801
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
it properly uh in terms of

802
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,720
uh discarding from memory discarding

803
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,960
from from uh the background and so on

804
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
and so forth um and then the other thing

805
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,640
you want to do is you make sure you have

806
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
expiration right so you know three times

807
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,279
five times ten times boom you can't let

808
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,320
them test again they have to go through

809
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
a different cycle to reset their

810
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,360
password and some things like that we

811
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,960
find some apps leave themselves open to

812
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
brute force attacks because they put no

813
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,440
limiting

814
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,120
on their authentication cycle as well

815
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
all right so insecure coding practices

816
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
take a quick look at where i am here so

817
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,240
um

818
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,559
this is kind of your gamut of

819
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,080
developers love to put extra stuff in

820
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
their app they love to collect extra

821
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
things they forget to things like

822
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,679
hard-coded urls and secrets and all that

823
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,480
other good stuff so and you can see 47

824
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,440
which is only one percentage point less

825
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
uh than the network side of the house

826
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
um

827
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,799
obviously there's going to be logic

828
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,120
flows in it we're finding more and more

829
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
these are coming from third-party

830
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
libraries you know and it's it's not

831
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,520
necessarily that the libraries are

832
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
malicious they just weren't well coded

833
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
right and so the developer doesn't

834
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,120
necessarily know how to judge the

835
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,799
quality of a library they choose they're

836
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,200
looking for expediency or or what have

837
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,640
you and that's why again everybody's

838
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
looking at supply chain right now

839
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
um so we also find a lot of extra debug

840
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
features in there uh our our two or

841
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
three debug flag oriented automated

842
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,320
tests trigger a lot

843
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,919
um just because it's there you know

844
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,000
maybe somebody didn't set the build

845
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,559
correctly so that when the build is run

846
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,240
lots of debug is still left in there

847
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,760
because they're used to using in a qa

848
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,120
process again some of those things are

849
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
just on the control side that you can do

850
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,440
better

851
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,200
um but that's what the bad guys look for

852
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,480
they're looking for debug everywhere

853
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,520
because that's a really great way for

854
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,880
them to hook into the app and find their

855
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
way through it so

856
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,279
um

857
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,279
the biggest thing for insecure coding is

858
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,640
bad crypto

859
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
so uh and it's it's in spades in fact in

860
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,600
our in our automated testing platform

861
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
we've expanded from half a dozen to over

862
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
20 different um crypto detection issues

863
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,760
plus uh bad third-party libraries that

864
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,480
are numerous uh related to it so

865
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,200
um use of static values i mean come on

866
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,399
folks um short key lengths come on folks

867
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
a lot of this stuff is like fixed in

868
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
five minutes if they know how to do it

869
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,039
the right way

870
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,000
and um cert is another issue uh so they

871
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
might be using certificate and

872
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,399
certificate pinning but they're not

873
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,480
using it correctly

874
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,600
and so you need to check that it's

875
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
actually being done well um also test

876
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,640
for error conditions we found uh

877
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
oftentimes to aid the development and qa

878
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,720
process they have very verbose logging

879
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
well you know what bad guy's going to go

880
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
create error conditions and go look at

881
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,080
the logs and see what might be left in

882
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,399
there and we find a lot of forensic data

883
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,080
buried in those log files especially

884
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,279
from the air conditioned side of the

885
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,039
house and you know i think at every

886
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,559
conference and every conversation i have

887
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
everybody says look at the third parties

888
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,360
they really are

889
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,000
the bane of your existence

890
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
so uh anti-tampering so this is this is

891
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
interesting so um

892
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,799
obviously there are things that you have

893
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
that are defenses in your web perimeter

894
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
and your network perimeter when you get

895
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,279
to the mobile device you start with the

896
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,880
fact that okay so

897
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
bad guys bad actors nation states

898
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
they're going to have devices that are

899
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
instrumented jail broken and rooted in a

900
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,159
way that they can instrument an

901
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
application sniffed everything memory

902
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,080
probes the whole nine yards there's even

903
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,760
kits you can buy that have you know like

904
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
probes in the semiconductors and things

905
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,240
like that to really do it uh in a deep

906
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
way and so we find about a third of apps

907
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,799
are exposable to reverse engineering in

908
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,679
a bad way now if you presume and you

909
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,120
work with your architects and your

910
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,880
developers and you presume that your app

911
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,640
is going to be reversed

912
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,039
let that guide how you design and build

913
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,080
the app

914
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,480
we had a uh with someone come to us that

915
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
said we want you to pen test the app

916
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,679
because

917
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,559
we keep getting these these

918
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,840
coupons

919
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,399
coming through to buy things

920
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,679
and we can't figure out where they're

921
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,120
coming from so we get in there and we

922
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,960
reverse the app in like 10 minutes one

923
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,520
of our pen testers found that the actual

924
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,720
method

925
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,520
for

926
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,760
generating the coupon code was in their

927
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
app it wasn't on the server side it was

928
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,360
in the app

929
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,039
right so

930
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,720
guys had reversed it dumped on the dark

931
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,039
web here's here's the code generating ip

932
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,640
no one else ever had to breach the app

933
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,399
because once you had the method you

934
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,679
could just publish the method right

935
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,840
people go go generate their codes so

936
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,600
that's an example of smart architecture

937
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
right has nothing to do with actual

938
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
testing it has to do with did you do the

939
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
right thing

940
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
anything that's sensitive should be

941
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,679
stored and generated on the back end now

942
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,039
developers will say oh for user

943
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,120
experience and network latency and you

944
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,559
know it's going to cost me 10 more

945
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,399
milliseconds to do another round trip or

946
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,080
whatever else everybody's got pretty

947
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,480
good bandwidth right if you're really

948
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,320
designing an online offline app then

949
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,760
think very carefully about what your

950
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,080
offline experience really needs to be

951
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,679
from that perspective and again

952
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,039
developers are trying to create a great

953
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,399
experience for the user so there's

954
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
balances in there and the architectural

955
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,320
strategy you might want to do

956
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
so our number one tip for resiliency is

957
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,600
actually a smart architecture right from

958
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,159
that perspective what sensitive data are

959
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
you transmitting storing capturing what

960
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
key management might be necessary what

961
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,440
crypto is appropriate uh and so on and

962
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
so forth and making sure you do as much

963
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,039
work on the server side now i keep

964
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,679
talking about reversing so um the better

965
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,600
tools out there are frida and radari uh

966
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,919
and there's a link to the repo as well

967
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,519
they are advanced tools so you'll need

968
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,200
some training or have your own advanced

969
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
skills in order to use them but

970
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,600
even anti-tamper we can get around a

971
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,559
sophisticated user of uh radari can get

972
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,559
around most anti-tampering commercial

973
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,600
tools you can buy um using it if they're

974
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,200
really smart and know what they're doing

975
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,320
so um however that doesn't mean don't

976
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,480
use third party obfuscation tools using

977
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
third-party obfuscation tools helps the

978
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,600
non helps protect you from the

979
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,519
non-nation state actors

980
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,880
right so they're the ones that are going

981
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
to help you from the semi-amateur to

982
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,399
mid-level amateur

983
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,600
you know when you think about the bad

984
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,039
guys you know it's all about they're

985
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,480
going to go where the money is if it's

986
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
really hard and they find they've got

987
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
stuff to look for signatures of the

988
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
anti-tampering and if they see certain

989
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
things they're just going to be like

990
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,760
unless there's a high likelihood of a

991
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
payload here i'm not going to go fight

992
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,200
my way through it even though i said i

993
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,559
could reverse it with fedari it could

994
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,320
still take me weeks to do it

995
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
right much like you would talk about you

996
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,679
know take a crate a crack a piece of

997
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,120
crypto so

998
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
um on android there's a cool api that

999
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,080
came out in 19

1000
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,919
called safetynet that safety net

1001
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:16,799
actually

1002
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,519
checks for the integrity of the device

1003
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,600
so is the device rooted does the device

1004
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
have certain probes on it it's actually

1005
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,039
google's actually tracking the tooling

1006
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,240
out there and looking for tooling

1007
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,440
signatures

1008
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
uh even all the way down to potential

1009
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
tampering of the silicon

1010
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,519
in the device

1011
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,600
and proper use of things like tee

1012
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,519
so um safety net is good api again

1013
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,480
that's one of those things you can just

1014
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,559
look for in the code is it on or off

1015
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,080
right and then when it's on you pick up

1016
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
a lot of a lot of free stuff

1017
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,559
um and then um

1018
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,480
you know you should as a pen tester if

1019
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,840
you're worried about this and resiliency

1020
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
matters you should jailbreak or root the

1021
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,399
device and test it for resiliency the

1022
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,399
reality is there isn't just a single api

1023
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
call that protects everything so

1024
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,399
on ios for example for a for a

1025
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,919
jailbroken device there's multiple

1026
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,080
different techniques um that the

1027
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
developers are going to need to apply to

1028
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
try to get around the tooling that the

1029
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,880
bad guys or the good guys are going to

1030
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,840
try to use also watch out for string

1031
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,200
tables and methods those are other

1032
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
places where you can hook in and find

1033
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
information as well and depending on how

1034
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,080
those are structured you can make it a

1035
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
lot harder for the bad guy to get in

1036
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,960
there so

1037
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,279
the um the thing that cracks me up the

1038
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,320
most is is when when we talk to a client

1039
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
they're like oh we're not worried about

1040
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
security bugs we've got anti-tampering

1041
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,279
in place

1042
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,720
yeah right

1043
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,559
so um we were we were with a um a

1044
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,000
trading company

1045
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and showed them the man in the middle

1046
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
attack and they're like oh yeah we just

1047
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
bought xyz obfuscation tool that's going

1048
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,519
to protect us and we're sitting there so

1049
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,279
we said okay so we left we asked for ask

1050
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,559
for a meeting again a week later we went

1051
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
back and so we we took their app we

1052
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
inserted that anti-tampering stuff and

1053
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,960
showed how we could do the same thing

1054
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
all over again

1055
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
we actually work with some of the

1056
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,480
anti-tampering guys who actually use us

1057
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
in a validation cycle to show

1058
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
that

1059
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,679
we test the app

1060
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
then they put the tampering in we test

1061
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,199
the app again to show that their

1062
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,560
anti-tampering doesn't create new

1063
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,159
vulnerabilities

1064
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,399
right but it also shows it doesn't fix

1065
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,520
any of them

1066
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,440
right so if your app has five phones in

1067
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,239
it

1068
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,239
you go obfuscate it and we test it again

1069
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,599
we're still going to find the five i

1070
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,800
don't think we've ever not found the

1071
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,119
same five right so from that perspective

1072
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,719
the anti-tampering can make it harder to

1073
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,159
reverse you know put friction in the

1074
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
machine but it doesn't replace the good

1075
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
hygiene parts of what you really should

1076
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,480
be doing in the mobile app

1077
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,679
so um that's the five right so hopefully

1078
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,599
you're not terrified to use your device

1079
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,440
uh or any of the apps on it but you know

1080
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,520
the reality is just like websites some

1081
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,679
are better than others um it's a really

1082
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,239
interesting and lucrative place

1083
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,159
if you talk to pen testing companies

1084
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,480
mobile pen testers typically make 25 to

1085
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,440
40 more money than other kinds of pen

1086
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,119
testers especially if you develop iot

1087
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,160
skills

1088
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
um so from a career perspective it's a

1089
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,200
great place to go by the way we're

1090
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,040
hiring um

1091
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,800
so uh i have got 14 pen testing 12 to 14

1092
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
pen testing slots open right now

1093
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
we have more business than we know know

1094
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
what to do with from that perspective

1095
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,400
but um the reality is that we're going

1096
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,920
out and training everywhere we can

1097
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,520
including in colleges now to try to get

1098
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,920
some people to come into this space

1099
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,040
and have fun and fun with it now

1100
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,520
if you think about the test program that

1101
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,880
you have answer yourself this question

1102
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,320
do your developers write testable code

1103
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,160
do your developers write their own test

1104
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,079
cases well if your developers write

1105
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
their own test cases they probably write

1106
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,480
testable code and if they don't they

1107
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,160
probably don't now let me explain what a

1108
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,839
little bit of that means so the first

1109
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,359
thing is a tool kit so if you're going

1110
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,760
to go the homegrown uh world here's what

1111
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,200
we typically find to get the the oauth

1112
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,280
tools the mstg hacking playground is

1113
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,560
great there's lots and lots of tooling

1114
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,359
in there

1115
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,880
um there's frida and radari that i

1116
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,240
talked about earlier most people want

1117
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,880
some sort of network tool so burp or is

1118
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,240
that attack or what have you and then

1119
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,440
you will need jailbroken and rooted

1120
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
devices you can't do this without those

1121
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,680
rooting is easy on just about anything

1122
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,000
jailbreak is hard cydia and one or two

1123
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,359
other jailbreaks are out there apple's

1124
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,640
getting better and better at making it

1125
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
harder and harder to jailbreak a device

1126
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,599
we do have tooling that can can test a

1127
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,119
lot of things without a jailbreak so

1128
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,720
it's jail testing

1129
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,800
in our automated tools but that's

1130
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,640
something to factor in out there

1131
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
the iphone in your hand you probably

1132
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,440
can't use you probably have to go buy an

1133
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,599
older iphone device uh that's still got

1134
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,200
an older os on it and there's a kind of

1135
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,240
a

1136
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,839
gray market for those that you can you

1137
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,880
can find

1138
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
um

1139
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,160
uh now from from an automation

1140
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,920
perspective um there's some free tools

1141
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
out there to do automated s bombs i'm

1142
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
going to show you there's free tools of

1143
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,960
doing automated analysis um

1144
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
if you look at something like mob sf

1145
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,599
that's also a free tool out there mob sf

1146
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,839
if i benchmark a mob sf report against

1147
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,520
one of my people or one of my tools it

1148
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
will blow your mind

1149
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
mob sf generates a ton of false

1150
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
positives and misses a lot and that's

1151
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,079
the nature of a free open source tool

1152
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,760
trying to be a commercial tool

1153
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
but it's out there and then we have a

1154
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,680
toolkit for pen testers and we have a

1155
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,200
an automated platform that plugs into

1156
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
your devsecops pipeline is gauge code

1157
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
all the time right runs autonomously in

1158
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,079
the background so

1159
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,880
and it's got all the the sas das is api

1160
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,560
sec cyclone dx and all that other fun

1161
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
stuff in it so that can be the toolkit

1162
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,720
now the thing the single biggest thing

1163
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,280
that we find that's related to testing

1164
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
efficiency is the testability of an

1165
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
application and of itself

1166
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,119
so when when you're

1167
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,800
when you're writing a web app and you're

1168
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
testing a web app if you're using any of

1169
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
the test automation tools in the web app

1170
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,839
there's a set of standards that you're

1171
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,359
looking for right how am i hooking a

1172
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,359
control name and things like that

1173
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,800
in mobile it's a little more of the wild

1174
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,839
west so there's there's commercial ui ux

1175
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,520
and functional testing vendors guys like

1176
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,280
perfecto for example and smart baron

1177
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,520
things like that and they can do ux

1178
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,119
navigation and they can automate a lot

1179
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,800
of that with like record playback or you

1180
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
can write scripts in order to make that

1181
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,560
happen but for security testing some of

1182
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,079
that you need to do as well like how am

1183
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:58,960
i actually going to test the

1184
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,280
authentication of my app and do it in a

1185
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,560
way that i can test it every day and

1186
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
break the build for example um and so

1187
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,599
the the testability of an app really has

1188
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
to do with how the app is designed so

1189
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,960
that the test automation tools can do

1190
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
the work for you now if you're doing

1191
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,839
manual pen testing it's just as

1192
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,079
beneficial but the automation is got a

1193
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,359
lot more value to it from that

1194
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,480
perspective

1195
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,560
and so what we find is organizations

1196
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
where the security team works with the

1197
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
architecture and development and design

1198
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,800
teams to design in for testability they

1199
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
can move to a world where automated

1200
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,560
testing can cover 60 to 100 of what they

1201
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
need and then the manual testing is the

1202
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
edge cases the more complicated things

1203
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,079
and the analysts shift into more of an

1204
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,680
advisory role on the development side

1205
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
rather than the hands on keyboard all

1206
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
the time

1207
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,359
so

1208
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
if you need speed tell your developers

1209
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
that's how to get security out of the

1210
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,480
way write a testable app that i can

1211
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,040
automate the testing on right now

1212
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,560
what gets in the way

1213
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,920
captcha

1214
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,760
so i've got an automation engine that

1215
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,680
can navigate an application but i can't

1216
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
bypass caption no functional testing

1217
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
vendor no ux testing vendor in the world

1218
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,280
can buy past capture if i did i'd be a

1219
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,880
trillionaire if i had that product right

1220
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,280
imagine who i could sell that to

1221
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,599
multi-factor authentication can't bypass

1222
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,440
that either does that mean i can't test

1223
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
it no that means give me a build with

1224
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,320
those disabled or give me a path to do

1225
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
something when my automation hits that

1226
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,880
part of the app so i can get past it and

1227
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,440
automate everything else behind it right

1228
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,079
anti-tampering install anti-tampering

1229
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,800
after qa not before a lot of developers

1230
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,240
want to put it in the repo and have it

1231
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,920
be in the build well anti-tampering gets

1232
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,280
in the way of your functional testing

1233
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,359
and your security testing right so do

1234
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,200
that after you've certified that the app

1235
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,520
is is uh there and then inconsistent

1236
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,599
object labeling so the way most

1237
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,480
automation tools navigate the ux is

1238
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,079
actually through labels that they can

1239
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
either see at an api level or on the

1240
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,599
screen level and when that's

1241
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,960
inconsistent throughout the app it

1242
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,640
doesn't work you know how to make them

1243
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,880
consistent

1244
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,240
accessibility controls

1245
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,480
if your development team follows the

1246
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,880
apple and google guidelines to use

1247
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,040
accessibility controls which allows the

1248
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
phone to like read things to the user

1249
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,560
and stuff like that

1250
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,400
all of the automation vendors hook into

1251
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,319
those and so you're functional testing

1252
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,319
your qa buddies along with your security

1253
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,319
teams excuse me get a much better

1254
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,240
automated automatability a much higher

1255
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,920
percentage of automation just by making

1256
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
sure they use the accessibility controls

1257
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,520
there are design requirements to it

1258
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
there are coding requirements to it but

1259
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,640
that actually makes your qa team and

1260
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,440
your security team a lot more

1261
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,960
proactive and productive from this

1262
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,760
perspective we have customers that

1263
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,000
automate 90 to 95 percent of their

1264
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,839
security testing

1265
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,200
the other five percent is still the

1266
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,720
human pen testing part and yes they have

1267
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,839
governance rules where they have to have

1268
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,359
third party pen tests for certain things

1269
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,119
and things like that but that's their

1270
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,359
functional ui ux testing and their

1271
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:44,960
security testing they're able to do it

1272
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,720
because they've got the right strategies

1273
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,240
in place and agreements with the

1274
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,839
development team about basically writing

1275
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,599
testable code and i think you're going

1276
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,119
to hear more and more of that because as

1277
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,480
people are trying to move faster and

1278
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,400
faster you need to automate as much as

1279
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,880
you can and that gets into testability

1280
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
now i'm going to veer off into two

1281
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
parallel areas here that are really

1282
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,839
useful and

1283
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,359
we're working with a number of other

1284
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,520
organizations including jeff and

1285
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
contrast and others on a spec called

1286
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,000
cyclone dx so cyclone dx was its own

1287
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,560
project that merged into o-wasp and

1288
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,280
cyclone dx is basically a standard way

1289
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,040
to produce an s-bomb with a standard

1290
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,359
vocabulary for that s-bomb

1291
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,000
cyclone dx was launched publicly this

1292
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
spring

1293
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,839
steve spriggett and patrick dryer are

1294
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,680
the drivers of it if you don't know

1295
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,760
steve steve runs apsec for a small

1296
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,160
company called servicenow

1297
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,079
and he's been around the the world for a

1298
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
long time he's worked on other specs

1299
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,160
um and so it's a great project to get

1300
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,839
involved in you know if you're in the

1301
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,280
session this morning with jeff talking

1302
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,599
about software labeling s-bombs are kind

1303
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,440
of a precursor to that s-bombs are also

1304
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,960
really important for your supply chain

1305
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,280
risks and one of the things we have as

1306
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,640
an as an industry right now that's a

1307
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,240
problem is there's no standardization

1308
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,920
for what is an s-bomb and how do i

1309
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,359
compare two different ones to each other

1310
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,800
and what information should it include

1311
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,079
in yada yada yada and that's basically

1312
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,839
what cyclone dx is doing

1313
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,599
something like 40 or 50 vendors have

1314
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,359
signed up and our their products are

1315
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,079
producing s-bomb using the cyclone dx as

1316
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,400
one of the as a standard output option

1317
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,880
uh myself included there's also a really

1318
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,280
cool tool which is the dependency track

1319
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,760
so at the auth 20th if you were online

1320
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,240
when steve presented he rolled out the

1321
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
dependency track tools so it's a it's an

1322
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,359
open source

1323
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,040
tool that you can use that will allow

1324
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,119
you to take any cyclone dx

1325
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,280
s-bomb and merge them together to get

1326
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,359
more aggregate analytics one of the

1327
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,359
really cool things one of our customers

1328
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,440
did with it was they actually looked at

1329
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,200
the entire chain so they had tools that

1330
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,640
were testing the cloud tools that were

1331
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,560
testing the back end and then our stuff

1332
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
testing the front end and they pulled it

1333
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,800
into the

1334
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,440
dependencytrac.org and merged the

1335
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,960
s-bombs from the front end and the back

1336
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
end all together to get a holistic view

1337
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
of their entire infrastructure right so

1338
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,319
that's been really cool tool the other

1339
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,000
thing you can do is you could take your

1340
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,920
entire portfolio of applications and

1341
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,119
load them into the industry the

1342
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,400
dependency tracker and you get a

1343
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,920
dashboard that's like what's the current

1344
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,000
state within that you'll find patterns

1345
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,599
like here are the teams that are using

1346
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,280
these bad libraries over here and guess

1347
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,800
what they all happen to be in australia

1348
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,560
or something right you know so you can

1349
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,760
find stuff like that in there so take

1350
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,040
advantage of it

1351
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,640
if you want to see if if you're on a

1352
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,160
mobile team or if your company has a

1353
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,599
mobile one you can submit it and we'll

1354
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,000
generate one for you uh so if you come

1355
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
to to the uh s bom uh location and uh i

1356
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,560
think this is gonna wind up getting

1357
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,200
posted into the cyclone dx project but

1358
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,280
it's basically a starting point uh to

1359
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
give people it doesn't list the phones

1360
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,960
it just lists what's in the bill of

1361
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,520
materials it does however

1362
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
peak down here it does actually do a sas

1363
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,599
and dash scan so it tells you if there

1364
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,520
are volumes in it not what they are so

1365
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,839
it's a little leading indicator for you

1366
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,119
um now i talked earlier about um mobile

1367
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,200
apps are talking more and more to things

1368
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,960
and so when we think about the mobile

1369
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,800
apps to things that's another vector

1370
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,720
that becomes very important about a

1371
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,560
third of our customers 20 30 of our

1372
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,160
customers are using us with a thing

1373
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,440
testing scenario so it's basically

1374
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,040
mobile apps talking to a thing or a ble

1375
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,119
wi-fi uh what have you and so um

1376
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,040
a couple of years ago a group you may or

1377
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,720
may not have ever heard of called io xt

1378
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,119
got started and ioxt was trying to

1379
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,400
conquer the certification for my things

1380
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,760
side of the house

1381
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,319
so amazon and the ring team for example

1382
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,440
is in there

1383
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,760
facebook google

1384
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,200
pretty much everybody except apple's in

1385
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,280
it and there are literally thousands of

1386
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,680
iot manufacturers that are involved in

1387
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,000
it and use it as a mechanism for testing

1388
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,760
things and so

1389
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,359
whether or not you've noticed things

1390
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,800
have actually gotten more secure from

1391
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,400
all the vendors that are part of the

1392
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,880
community and using the certification a

1393
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,240
lot of the issues with things now are

1394
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,480
like reusable passwords and not changing

1395
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,079
passwords and some stuff like that but a

1396
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,359
lot of the underlying infrastructure is

1397
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,640
getting better

1398
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
so what what the organization realized

1399
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,480
was need to do something about these

1400
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,000
mobile apps that are talking to these

1401
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,760
things so let's go create a mobile app

1402
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,160
spec and certification program for it

1403
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,760
and so they called us up and said you

1404
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,040
guys know what you're doing and we'd

1405
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,240
already done a ton of work with google

1406
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
and amazon and others and we started

1407
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,520
looking at it and after about the third

1408
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,079
or fourth meeting was like wait a minute

1409
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,839
m-a-s-v-s is over here

1410
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,599
why don't we just use that now when you

1411
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,440
think about m-a-s-v-s and the o-loss

1412
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,680
projects they're all frameworks they're

1413
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,160
not certification regimes but what if

1414
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,480
you took m-a-s-v-s did an intersection

1415
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,720
with io with iot things and the

1416
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
characteristics of those and actually

1417
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,800
created a certification standard to go

1418
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,720
with it and that's what was born

1419
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,960
so um we work with a bunch of other

1420
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,760
folks

1421
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
in order to create this it was also

1422
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,359
launched this spring and the idea was

1423
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,200
the mission was to create a reasonable

1424
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,040
reliable industry standard way to build

1425
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,560
tests and certify the security of mobile

1426
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,960
apps that connect to or through things

1427
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,839
right

1428
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,160
and um interestingly enough

1429
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
vpns are often appliances so they got to

1430
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,720
be called things which means we're also

1431
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
testing a lot of vpns as part of this as

1432
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,520
well

1433
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,839
i should release our vpn benchmark it

1434
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:54,800
would probably not blow your mind um but

1435
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,640
most people other people would be blown

1436
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,599
so um so we took the masves we went into

1437
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,560
a dark room and 60 days later popped out

1438
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,280
the ioxt certification spec now we

1439
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,599
didn't take the whole mvs and say you

1440
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,280
have to do everything we actually

1441
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,960
created an organized structure that said

1442
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,160
these are the things that are relevant

1443
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,119
these are the things that are most

1444
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,480
important and create a certification

1445
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,720
regime out of it organize it into eight

1446
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,640
organized it into eight categories there

1447
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,400
are some additional things in there like

1448
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,720
expiration and versioning that's not in

1449
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
the traditional oas oriented spec

1450
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,960
and things of that nature so you can

1451
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,800
actually make an attestation that this

1452
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,720
certification is only good up until this

1453
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,640
date or only good through this build

1454
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,720
version or something to that effect

1455
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,960
um and so it basically naturally expires

1456
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,040
or if dependencies expire and so on and

1457
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,200
so forth also added some minimum

1458
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,280
requirements which basically it's it's

1459
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,040
got a level one through three so you

1460
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
kind of have a low medium high so now

1461
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,400
you can do a grading thing right so i

1462
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,200
might choose to be low or medium or high

1463
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,560
and depending on what my thing is like

1464
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,319
all the healthcare ones are mostly high

1465
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,839
as you can imagine but there's other

1466
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,680
stuff like your doorbell though might

1467
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,040
might be good enough for that you know

1468
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,119
depending what the thing actually does

1469
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,400
and so

1470
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,240
um much like the mas vs mstg

1471
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,400
we created a profile that guy over there

1472
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,480
is something like 27 pages and then

1473
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,000
there's a test library and it's really

1474
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,359
great because almost every section you

1475
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,359
go into there's a footnote that says

1476
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,200
link to owasp or a link to oasper to

1477
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,560
learn more about this thing go back to

1478
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,280
the oas bim a svs or mstg as a resource

1479
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,079
so

1480
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,800
if you're if you're in web but some iot

1481
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,680
stuff and you want to learn about the

1482
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,359
iot side there's a lot of good learning

1483
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,680
resources from io xt but they're not

1484
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
like owasp with all of the sort of free

1485
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,440
world it's it's much more of vendor

1486
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,400
driven common common certification but

1487
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,920
it's a really cool way to say how do i

1488
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,319
take an ios project and and create a new

1489
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,160
thing out of it it's also an interesting

1490
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
exploration into how do you take a an os

1491
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,520
like framework and turn it into a

1492
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,599
certification regime uh from that

1493
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,880
perspective

1494
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,359
so i've talked a lot and i always talk a

1495

something for two days but we came up

1537
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,040
with something that was interesting and

1538
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,640
that the members were asking us our

1539
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,760
community members were saying hey could

1540
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,680
you help us convince our boss to care so

1541
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,040
we basically created a convince our boss

1542
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,240

1543
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,119

don't accidentally do an rd on somebody

1555
