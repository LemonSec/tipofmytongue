1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:18,080
[Music]

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,920
so uh i originally i was going to do

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,760
this presentation um as a security

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
person and then we have brad who was

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
uh an egghead i mean uh an accountant i

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
mean uh yeah a business guy so so we

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
went ahead and added them

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
and irm does not mean incident response

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,760
management

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
we found that out

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
so um

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
what the goals are today is to kind of

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
we want you to understand that there's a

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
communication language between business

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
people and what what we do right and if

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
we're if we're not speaking the same

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480
language then it's really hard for them

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,199
to give you money right or give you any

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
kind of resources

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,239
the second thing we're going to talk

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,559
about is is bringing everybody into the

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,559
project and into the the world of

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
security instead of alienating people

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,079
and saying no you can't do this or no

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,840
you can't do that i think even naturally

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
too i think the business doesn't feel

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
included they don't feel like it's their

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,080
responsibility or roles or just kind of

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,680
hands-off approach and not really trying

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,119
to be involved

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,119
yep and then

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,360
trying to provide metrics and metrics in

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
cyber security is difficult because

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,360
there's a lot a lot of ways to look at

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
things and then we'll also be talking

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,159
about objectiveness

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
so in pathways to security you basically

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,799
like you have physical security people

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,640
you have technical security people you

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
have uh business security people

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,119
and

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,960
when you come up in that direction you

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
actually get skewed on what you want to

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
pay attention to so i'm more likely to

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,040
pay attention to technical risks and

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,320
vulnerabilities

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
well if the business side right i mean i

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,680
i'm mostly in is concerned about

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
incidents that really affect me so i'm

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
not in worry about the details of the

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,720
vulnerabilities themselves it's like if

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
there's a significant incident to the

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,040
company it's going to affect me i want

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
to know about that one

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
so kind of knowing where that blind side

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,360
is the other thing is is trying to

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
figure out uh who's responsible for

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
these things right so we have chief risk

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
officers chief information security

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,878
officers senior management all the way

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,318
down to contractors and employees

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
everybody should be involved

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
the problem is if you're in a small

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
company you probably don't have a risk

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
officer right you may not even have a

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
cso

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
you may just have senior management

68
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
executives and contractors

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,800
but communicating the jobs are still the

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,560
same whether you're a small business or

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
you're a large business just the small

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,160
business may not have the resources that

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,239
large does so you still have to divvy

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,800
those responsibilities up to somebody

75
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
and making sure that they understand

76
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,519
what their job and their role is so you

77
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,720
think about these roles here so chief

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
risk officer right his role is to

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
manage the risk of organization every

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,879
company has risk i mean the best way to

81
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
have no risk is to not do business right

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,040
and that's not possible so his his job

83
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,319
is to understand the risk holistically

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
of the organization the risk of the

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
business side the cyber side everything

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
and manage that risk to acceptable you

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
know thresholds and inform senior

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
management who has objectives how we're

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
doing and can manage and balance that

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
risk versus you know aggressiveness of

91
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
doing business

92
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
and so they're relying on the chief

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,000
information security offer to give them

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,599
that information as well as people the

95
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,440
first line people doing the actual work

96
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
to communicate with them as well so

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
definitely all four are in related have

98
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
to work together to meet the business

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
objectives and manage risk appropriately

100
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,319
while still doing business okay

101
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
so the first thing that we kind of bring

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,040
up is culture of collaboration and this

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
is uh like you were saying earlier um

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
organizations are now bringing in you

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,799
know the business side to the

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
conversation of risk because they have

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
to right it's it's

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,080
it's incredibly important and it's one

109
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,599
of those things that when we go to the

110
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,920
organization as a cyber security person

111
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
and say you can't do this you can't do

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,159
this

113
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,159
you know we're we're shaming people on

114
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,120
on stuff

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
there was uh

116
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,439
you know

117
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
i think you had an incident that kind of

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
matches this yeah absolutely so um i've

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,120
been consulting my entire career except

120
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
for the last three years i was at a

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
large financial institution

122
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
and um so cyber was they had great

123
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
awareness program and they had a super

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
really strong fishing program so um you

125
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
know we get phishing emails all the time

126
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,680
and um

127
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,040
and i became excellent of spotting a

128
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
phishing email right but the problem was

129
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,680
is really aggressive so if you um as a

130
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
business person if i fell for it and

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,358
responded the first time i get my hand

132
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
slapped second time they notified my

133
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
boss and he's been training the third

134
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,000
time it was

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
i lost access to my computer until i did

136
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
training it made it really onerous and

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,639
so um

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
from a business perspective

139
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,960
i appreciate the awareness became really

140
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,639
aggressive to the point where

141
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,919
i didn't want to work the sidewalk even

142
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,360
if i had another problem outside of

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
phishing there's no way i can go talk to

144
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
them because i was probably wrong i'd

145
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
probably get in trouble for even talking

146
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,280
to them right or doing something so that

147
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
culture was

148
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
it wasn't inclusive right it was like i

149
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,080
was almost afraid to talk to them

150
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,040
because they were going to cause other

151
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,560
issues for me as as opposed to

152
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
collaborating with me

153
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
and the other thing is uh people are

154
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
always afraid to re report up an event

155
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
right so they see somebody strange in

156
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
the hallway they don't have a badge but

157
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
they don't say anything right they're

158
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,600
scared they're like i don't want to you

159
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
know i don't want to get involved i

160
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
would say the easiest way to break into

161
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
a building is carry a box right and

162
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
somebody will open the door for you

163
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,240
so in the past and i mean this is just

164
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
kind of the way i feel is

165
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
security was a fear-based right you if

166
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,840
you don't do this somebody's going to

167
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
hack in and there's this bad guy hacker

168
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
who's just going to kill us and you know

169
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,919
the problem with that is is if it

170
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
doesn't happen

171
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
then now it's like well i get away with

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
it right optimistic bias kind of

173
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
beats fear every time right so it's

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
we know texting while driving is bad

175
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
we still do it right because there's a

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,520
thousand times that we haven't been into

177
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
a wreck but then that one time you're

178
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,560
gonna do a wreck and kill somebody or

179
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
kill yourself

180
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,600
then it's concerning right

181
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,960
so um

182
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,039
the way to kind of help an organization

183
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
to understand that is is give them not a

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
fear base but but give them a business

185
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
base right so give them like hey if you

186
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,280
don't do this the potential risk is 500

187
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,360
000 loss in two days

188
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
right i think the key thing too is the

189
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
news trends right so from the business

190
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
perspective if i'm not have a part if i

191
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,880
don't have a partner with my cyber team

192
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,919
they're not really telling what the real

193
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,440
risks are i'm hearing on the news right

194
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
so rant somewhere that's the obvious one

195
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
that's probably beaten to death we might

196
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
do everything in under our power to

197
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
focus on ransomware and ignore data

198
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
privacy or other things because we're

199
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
listening to the news trends versus our

200
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
internal cyber teams i don't really want

201
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
to work with them to get that advice

202
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
from them directly

203
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
so the other thing is is know your

204
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
audience and when you think of a c level

205
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,400
executive so cfo if you talk about the

206
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
cfo of coca-cola

207
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,639
that dude's got like 35 years of

208
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,960
experience for you i mean this guy's

209
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
orgal has been through everything

210
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
they've done you know they're a very

211
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
high level top executive

212
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
when you're a cso that's only been

213
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
around since 1994.

214
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
some of us have kids older than that

215
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
right

216
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
so it's one of those things that the cso

217
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
is not they don't have the key to the

218
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
executive bathroom they have to see in

219
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,639
their title but they don't have the

220
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,240
authority or the power to do what they

221
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
need to do sometimes

222
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,080
so in order to do that you have to be

223
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
communicating to the organization on

224
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,319
their terms and in their the way that

225
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,960
they speak you know i think just to add

226
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
that i think we are seeing a trend

227
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,479
hopefully it continues this you call

228
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
little c versus big c for the c cell it

229
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
should be elevated for sure right i

230
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,840
think there's a growing awareness of how

231
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
important it is to see so to actually be

232
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,199
part of the broad the leadership group

233
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,680
versus informing leadership group yeah i

234
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
i have one customer who the cso reports

235
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
to

236
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
a manager who reports to a director who

237
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,680
reports to like uh cio right it's like

238
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,479
so many levels down that his message

239
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,479
never gets filtered up and it's also

240
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,280
he's reporting through i.t right so now

241
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,879
you're reporting through i.t trying to

242
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,280
tell problems about i.t oh yeah that

243
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,560
person is going to be more than happy to

244
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
go talk to the board right and then i

245
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
have another organization that i work

246
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
with where the the ciso reports only to

247
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,919
the board and to the president of the

248
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
company they're a defense contractor

249
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
they understand it right

250
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
so hopefully the the

251
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,840
the industry will catch up i mean the

252
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,759
federal government understands secrets

253
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,680
and security a lot better than kind of

254
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,599
the open market and then the other thing

255
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,400
is

256
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,879
focusing on communicating and not fixing

257
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
um some someone gave me really good

258
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
advice they said an employee was coming

259
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
in late all the time and you know

260
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
instead of saying well have you set your

261
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
alarm clock have you done this have you

262
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
done this you know just say what are you

263
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,680
going to do to fix it right so giving

264
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
them solutions is not necessarily always

265
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
the easy thing but actually asking them

266
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,919
what their solution should be

267
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
getting the advice from the organization

268
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,240
we all know kevin o'leary um mr

269
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
wonderful

270
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
uh if you if you've all seen shark tank

271
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
if they walk in and they go what are

272
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
your sales numbers and they go uh uh uh

273
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
he attacks them right he's somewhat

274
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
right because if you don't know the

275
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
numbers behind what you're doing

276
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,720
and can't demonstrate that to the

277
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
organization

278
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
what are you really doing as a cso or as

279
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
a security person i don't know if you

280
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
i've i don't know every october of a lot

281
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,279
of companies it's budget season right

282
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,480
and so we

283
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,560
the thing in the prior screen what's

284
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,600
commonly done is leaders of those

285
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,959
organizations marching at the conference

286
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
room say here's my budget request for

287
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
this year um

288
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,839
cso team wants you know x number of

289
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,800
dollars that's exactly what happens um

290
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
there's usually a kevin o'leary at the

291
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
table who's who's she's often from

292
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
accounting or cfo's office who's in

293
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
charge of maintaining the budget and

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
exactly it's like okay they're gonna ask

295
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
the same type of questions um you know

296
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,160
how much does it cost why do we actually

297
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
need it what's the benefit why why do i

298
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
want to use as a company what you know

299
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,680
so if you can't communicate that it's

300
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,959
it's pretty easy you know everyone wants

301
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,640
a budget every year right but they get

302
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
scrutinized pretty heavily just like it

303
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
would be on shark tank or some other um

304
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
situation like that where someone's

305
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,760
giving you money you really have to have

306
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
those answers behind your request to

307
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
justify and back it up the other thing

308
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
we've seen in the industry is that it's

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
no longer

310
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
security isn't necessarily a cost center

311
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
it can be a profit center so if you go

312
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
to your marketing group and say look you

313
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,399
know if we stand up and we say hey we're

314
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,920
secure

315
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
every tv commercial you see apple

316
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,279
everybody else is saying you know

317
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,600
security's most in forefront right so it

318
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,959
can be a business driver that can

319
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
actually help the organization

320
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
and like even in federal contracts we've

321
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,800
seen

322
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
the point system by being nist compliant

323
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
or cmmc compliant those points on an rfp

324
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
can go up so therefore

325
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,760
you know it kind of helps to get get

326
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
funding that direction well in that last

327
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
stop there you think about reputational

328
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
risk that's becoming more and more of a

329
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
receivable think about based on you know

330
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
cyber incident cyber crimes

331
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
and so the

332
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,440
having low

333
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
reputational risk because you have a

334
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
strong cyber program is definitely a

335
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
selling point to investors and you know

336
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,839
to clients of your

337
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,040
organization and then on business impact

338
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
analysis bringing in tabletop exercises

339
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
and bringing them into the thing um

340
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
bringing them into the

341
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
experience of understanding what that

342
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
looks like is much more helpful than

343
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,120
just telling them that this is what the

344
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
risks are yeah so absolutely so when you

345
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
think about

346
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
um you talk about risk it's it's it's

347
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
there sometimes it's kind of nebulous

348
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,320
you don't you think to the business they

349
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,760
kind of understand what they might be

350
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,839
and you ask them so what's your risk of

351
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
if if your process that you execute say

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,519
you're doing a financial process and i'm

353
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,519
in charge of accounting if your process

354
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,200
goes down for a week and you can't use

355
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,040
your accounting system you know what's

356
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,360
what's the impact to you what's the risk

357
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,640
how's it going to affect you they may

358
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
think i got my spreadsheets i can do it

359
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
offline or whatever i

360
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,920
don't really they give you a general

361
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
response maybe but when you actually

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
make them do the exercise

363
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,440
and actually simulate it happening and

364
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
you walk them through the scenarios and

365
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
you you make it seem like to make more

366
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
realistic right as things change over

367
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
time it forces them to kind of live

368
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
through without actually having the pain

369
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,120
and give you better information to help

370
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
you quantify the results so what is that

371
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
what is the actual risk to them if they

372
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,240
lose access to their systems for a week

373
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
or a month or whatever they can now tell

374
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,079
you because they've lived through it and

375
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,360
more importantly

376
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
since they've lived through it in a

377
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
sense they're more supportive of what

378
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
you're trying to do they actually

379
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,959
realize the impact of them they've kind

380
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
of they've had a scenario that kind of

381
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,519
highlights what it's going to be and

382
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,440
they're going to be more

383
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
supportive what you're trying to help

384
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,600
them

385
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
so one of my the best customers that

386
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,839
i've ever had were customers who got

387
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,600
breached right as soon as they get

388
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,959
breached

389
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,560
there's no problem right they just throw

390
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
the money at you

391
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
and then after that that sting you know

392
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
it's the same the safest place in

393
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
america was new york city 912 right if

394
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
you left a package on the side of the

395
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
road somebody was going to call and get

396
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,560
it taken care of right because an

397
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
incident happened this is an easy way to

398
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,839
get him to go through an incident

399
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,959
without actually having to go through

400
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,519
the incident

401
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,040
and i think the last thing on the bottom

402
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
of that slide

403
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
you think about communicating the

404
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
business right

405
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:45,920
um

406
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
you know you've ever heard of swot

407
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,800
analysis

408
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,839
you know strengths weakness

409
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
opportunities threats very common thing

410
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,480
right and so if you can actually

411
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,160
demonstrate what those are and so you

412
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
can communicate in this to the strengths

413
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
right and so you kind of highlight what

414
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
your weaknesses might be um you know

415
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,720
working from home example right um

416
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,680
or

417
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,839
no no remote access things that they can

418
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
actually

419
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
you can quantify in one of those four

420
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
buckets

421
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
you're suddenly speaking their language

422
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
it's not just

423
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
statistics to them

424
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,120
and you can also map that swot analysis

425
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
over to

426
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,160
a framework right so if you if you're

427
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,200
using a csf or you're using this

428
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
but by going through the framework that

429
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,639
we understand and then putting it into

430
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
you know key enablers also

431
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
kind of building a roadmap for what's

432
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,639
going to come is important right so

433
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,160
doing basically your strengths your

434
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
weaknesses your average your

435
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
opportunities

436
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
it can again give them

437
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,079
what we understand from the translation

438
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,399
from uh you know like a nist framework

439
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,680
over to what they understand which is a

440
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
road map of what needs to happen but i

441
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,199
think the business you know communicates

442
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
in frameworks themselves right they may

443
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
use a different type of framework um but

444
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,160
they they respect when you're talking in

445
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,399
in the lens of a framework right has

446
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,920
some credibility to you and your

447
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
organization if you can demonstrate

448
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,519
through a well-known favorite framework

449
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,959
how you're doing and pointing out your

450
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,199
strengths and weaknesses um

451
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,399
yeah that's what they're doing anyway

452
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
they're doing the same thing based on

453
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
their framework so really as you think

454
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
about bringing risk holistically

455
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,880
together across a company

456
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
this is a great way to give to your

457
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,480
information give your cro who's

458
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,639
reporting on your behalf to the ceo how

459
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
we're doing with risk and our company

460
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
and and it's it's again important to

461
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,199
have a road map

462
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,639
because if you go to the table and you

463
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,240
say i need this much money and then next

464
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,839
week you go i need this much money and i

465
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,519
swear to god this is it and then next

466
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,240
week you go for more money um that

467
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,800
lessens your credibility right so so

468
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
they had a budget in mind you've kind of

469
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
overshot it so going through the math of

470
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,720
this for us and really getting objective

471
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
opinions making sure that you talk to

472
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,000
everybody about it is critically

473
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
important

474
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
another thing too so you want a roadmap

475
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
right so think about any project you've

476
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,040
done in your life you set up a project

477
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
you're going to execute that project

478
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,440
right so we have a roadmap we're going

479
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
to do a roadmap what if nobody's

480
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,240
managing the project over time what

481
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,440
happens to the project just kind of

482
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
it fizzles out right it's the same

483
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
concept here so you talk about

484
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,399
governance you know governance is kind

485
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,839
of a nebulous term

486
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,959
but governance is is that function that

487
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,639
makes sure the project's being executed

488
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,160
it defines who's in charge who the

489
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
decision maker is and more importantly

490
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
over time has processes built into it

491
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,199
demands change right so i built my

492
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
roadmap at the beginning of the year and

493
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,600
my priorities might change unexpectedly

494
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
and so what's the process for absorbing

495
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,279
that change and changing this roadmap in

496
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
a way that makes sense for my company

497
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,160
and so that's where you have to have

498
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
this government strategy

499
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
and processes and team in place to

500
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
adjust your roadmap as necessary but

501
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
also keep you on track and make sure

502
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
it's being executed and the governance

503
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,680
can also look over everything instead of

504
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,720
just the pieces that we understand so um

505
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,079
you know

506
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
trash is not our our business right

507
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
disposal of trash is not we're not

508
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
custodians but when you know something

509
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
gets leaked in the trash and goes public

510
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,880
and we get fired we can say it's not our

511
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
job all the time but it's still our job

512
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
right so having an overall

513
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,079
understanding and also pointing out to

514
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,839
the resources that it may be their job

515
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,519
what their what their tasks are and we

516
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,720
had a good conversation with joe before

517
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
this meeting started today sometimes

518
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,880
so the the governance committee the

519
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,000
government's team may be part of the

520
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
cyber space right inside of your team

521
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
the csos group but you might have

522
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,839
representatives in business on that same

523
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
committee and so we can holistically

524
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,320
look at how what you're doing

525
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
affects the company or how it rolls into

526
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
their broader risk strategy

527
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,199
so

528
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,279
based on risk we all have kind of our

529
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,040
own definition of what that means low

530
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,720
medium high red you know green yellow

531
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,360
7 9 12. it's just random numbers that we

532
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
just kind of assigned to stuff

533
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,240
um

534
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,519
we actually had a

535
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
customer share a report with us and he's

536
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
like hey this is what our our report was

537
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
and he goes we're a 3.5 and we're like

538
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,679
that a good thing

539
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
i don't i don't understand what that

540
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,199
means but and apparently the scale was

541
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,480
four

542
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
okay

543
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,919
um he goes yeah for 3.5 are really good

544
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,959
so

545
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
when you go to communicate that up and

546
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
i'm sure that when he went to go talk to

547
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
the um

548
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,919
the agency director and he said hey

549
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
we're a 3.5 agency director doesn't

550
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,760
really care right it doesn't mean

551
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
anything to them so therefore it's hard

552
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
for them to to give something to them

553
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,679
with with once you can put a

554
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
quantitative number to it and again do

555
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
the tabletop exercise through the

556
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
communication to the different risk

557
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
holders

558
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
um and and you want to kind of bundle

559
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,039
that right and one of the easiest ways

560
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
to put a number behind you know a risk

561
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,720
is

562
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,240
get hacked

563
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
you will learn very quickly when you go

564
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
to report it to your insurance company

565
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
or when you go to report it to the fbi

566
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
what your actual

567
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
cost is

568
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
and it's also critically like for

569
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,760
instance um every fbi agent uses a

570
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
different metric so

571
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,919
in austin it's a fifty thousand dollar

572
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
loss they'll get involved in new york

573
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,760
city it's like half a million dollars

574
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
they'll get involved right anything

575
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,280
under that threshold local offices

576
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
decide that

577
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
so having that kind of stuff ready to go

578
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
and understanding what those you know

579
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,200
risks and impacts to the business are

580
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
can help you

581
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
very quickly get you know someone else

582
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,160
involved it can also push up the

583
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
information to the the people who accept

584
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,679
the risk

585
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,160
as a cso we don't accept it's not our

586
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
job right we're not the risk holder at

587
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,000
the end of the day

588
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,440
it's not us

589
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
we're the

590
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
vessel that gets communicated up

591
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
but the the person who has fiduciary

592
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,520
responsibility who puts him they put

593
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
handcuffs on if they screw up that's not

594
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
us i think it's important too so

595
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,799
this this example we'll call i'll call

596
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,240
it a five-point risk scale right from

597
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
low risk to extreme risk and to matt's

598
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
point we kind of define what each

599
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,960
point on the scale means and in the risk

600
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,720
world nirvana would be if you could do

601
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,080
everything

602
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
quantitatively and that's what we're

603
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
going for but sometimes you just can't

604
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
sometimes it's qualitative but it's

605
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
important if you're going to do a

606
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,559
mixture of quantitative and qualitative

607
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,320
to kind of describe it right and so if

608
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,080
i'm medium risk i want to say what it is

609
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,400
but where it gets tricky is so in in

610
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
your area you may use this five-point

611
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
scale what you don't want to happen is

612
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
in the finance team have them using a

613
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
four-point scale or a three-point scale

614
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,799
rate or different risks so it's

615
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,039
important as an organization to have a

616
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
common risk taxonomy

617
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,720
risk categories and structure you're

618
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
applying to then and more importantly

619
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,120
you want to rate risk consistently the

620
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,559
same way

621
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,080
now large organizations that's not too

622
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,200
bad they'll have an enterprise risk

623
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,120
management team that in a sense is going

624
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
to own the risk taxonomy they're going

625
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,280
to own the methodology for rating risk

626
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,640
and calculating it now aggregates

627
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
together which is great right they're

628
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
going to work with the business with the

629
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,799
cyber and it teams to figure that out

630
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
but in small organizations you may not

631
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
have that support so you have to think

632
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,400
about

633
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
when you're communicating on your five

634
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
point scale to management does it align

635
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
with whatever scale they're using and

636
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
you know and so you can so you can

637
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
actually bring your 3.5 and compare

638
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
their 2.1 and actually be able to

639
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
compare apples to apples and so for

640
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,480
larger companies that's not a big deal

641
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
but small to medium-sized businesses

642
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,000
that's more challenging than it sounds

643
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,760
to actually rationalize risk and look at

644
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
it holistically and commonly and measure

645
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
it commonly across your organization

646
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,000
and it's also good

647
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,360
well it's also important to go to the

648
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,320
financial

649
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
financial side of it make sure that

650
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
their risk is the same as yours because

651
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,520
when you're going to ask for money later

652
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,640
they're the people who give it to you

653
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
well that's what i was going to say what

654
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,159
would you want to put like you have in

655
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
the medium rest

656
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
five or 50k number in there when you

657
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,679
want to put numbers in all of them you

658
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,760
would yeah absolutely you put you want

659
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
to put them wherever you can right yeah

660
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
absolutely so when you define what a low

661
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,000
risk is for your company say i'm a

662
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
fortune 50 company low risk for me might

663
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
literally be anything less than 500

664
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
million dollars but it if i'm a small

665
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,080
company that you know 500 million

666
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
dollars is catastrophic to me it's fi

667
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,120
that's extreme that's right you want to

668
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
be consistent so if i'm in finance or

669
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,799
you know whatever organization you want

670
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,919
to make sure the right numbers are the

671
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,760
right rating for your low risk and your

672
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
medium and your highs

673
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
and again when you go to do the

674
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
financial aspect of the quantitative

675
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
it's uh

676
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
it's important to go to the stakeholder

677
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
that they're involved right because if

678
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
you assign a number to them

679
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
they're not going to like that number if

680
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,799
you ask them what the number is and a

681
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,640
lot of times when we we've sit down to

682
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,400
do that business impact analysis we

683
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,159
looked at quad they're like i don't i

684
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,080
have no idea yeah we're working at your

685
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
mercy actually we're going to ask you

686
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,039
what is what is the number to me and

687
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
things like tabletop exercise and other

688
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
scenarios will help me work with you to

689
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,159
understand the number but it definitely

690
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,600
is a partnership to understand what that

691
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,120
number is going to be for me yeah

692
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,240
there's a great book called how to

693
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
measure anything and and you know it's

694
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,080
like when you ask someone how much does

695
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,760
this cost they say i don't know was it a

696
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
billion dollars no is it a hundred

697
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
dollars no

698
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,159
well we have a range let's start

699
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
narrowing that range down

700
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,520
the other example is a gumball thing

701
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,880
yeah matt has a great gumball math

702
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
example i like it i i don't remember

703
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,159
what it was on it was on like discovery

704
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,200
channel and i watched it it was

705
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
brilliant so they if you want to figure

706
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
out how many gumballs are in a gumball

707
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,200
machine or in the one little bases you

708
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,960
basically ask a hundred people how many

709
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
gumballs you think are in there and you

710
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
do the average and it's almost always

711
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,679
right

712
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
when you do the average that's the

713
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,480
correct answer so it's it's if you the

714
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039
more data inputs that you have and and

715
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,600
over time because year one

716
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
numbers might might be terrible year

717
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,679
five the numbers are starting to get

718
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
realistic right because now you've done

719
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
this exercise a few times you've gotten

720
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
more data inputs and maybe some stuff

721
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
has happened and you can actually you

722
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
know figure out what that cost is so

723
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,520
it's important to kind of include them

724
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
and also do it over time not just one

725
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,640
and done

726
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
there's a trend for you like doing risk

727
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,760
assessments in the financial space at

728
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
least from it used to be annual risk

729
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,360
assessment then it was quarterly

730
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
submissions monthly and now it's

731
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,720
automated if possible that's actually

732
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
ongoing or daily right so you get these

733
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
data points more frequently so more

734
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,159
meaningful versus these kind of

735
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,080
disparate points in time that are harder

736
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,000
to you know draw trends from

737
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,400
somebody's question

738
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,159
[Music]

739
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
some other things you can lean on

740
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,919
that'll give you a similar thing

741
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,960
is

742
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
when you look at quality look at defects

743
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,280
you'll get outages right you're always

744
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,120
looking what's the impact right is it

745
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,280
100 of users can't use the application

746
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,159
in the platform is it one right and like

747
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,679
you said there's that scale okay what

748
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,600
does it mean and you can narrow it down

749
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,480
and so when you can start to quantify

750
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,520
how how how many people of our customer

751
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
base is going to impact right or our

752
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
partners and and what does that look

753
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
like that'll help you kind of scale it

754
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,000
and

755
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,480
it's not quite you know full-on

756
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
quantitative as as much as making money

757
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
is but it gives you a good approximation

758
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
to tell you

759
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
how how impactful is this going to be

760
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
to our operations to our business

761
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
and now you're using language that are

762
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
your engineering teams your software

763
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
developers are already used to i agree

764
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
yeah and i think that's important to

765
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,679
understand is that by going to

766
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,679
this appsec right and to going to the

767
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,360
different people and looking at what

768
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
their

769
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,679
what's important to them

770
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,640
so for instance um if you go to

771
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
the physical security department right

772
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,840
they want to make sure nobody gets

773
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,799
killed

774
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
nothing gets stolen right so that's

775
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
their metrics right

776
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
so everybody has their own metrics but

777
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,320
you know financial seems to work with

778
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,640
financial people and like you said use

779
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
your account can be

780
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,919
incredibly important do you do five

781
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,360
nines or do you do you know

782
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,880
so

783
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
this is again kind of talking about what

784
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
we were talking about before

785
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,840
which you know i i've set up uh you know

786
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,080
risk dashboards right and all of my

787
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,320
metrics

788
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
those metrics are only valuable if

789
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,559
they're valuable to other people right

790
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,360
so

791
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
um i remember i set up a big dashboard

792
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
and everybody was happy and and then uh

793
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
the ceo came in was like

794
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
what is this you know like this is it

795
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
was just pretty dials that doesn't mean

796
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,960
 to me yeah as we know this

797
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
situation a year ago we had um a big

798
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,320
four firm come in and develop 17 risk

799
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,159
dashboards for us they interviewed our

800
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
team pretty quickly he said oh we got it

801
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,080
went off and came back you know after

802
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
six weeks with 17 risk dashboards and

803
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,640
they rolled out to our leadership team

804
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
and we looked at it and literally we

805
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,480
wanted one of them

806
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,799
it's a win i think yeah and it was it

807
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,480
was about issues and so

808
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
it's important you know dashboards are

809
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,679
great we like them the concept of

810
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
dashboard is fantastic right you can see

811
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
high information quickly you can drill

812
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,120
down if you want to but it's still

813
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
giving the right information that's

814
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,279
meaningful it's not helpful sometimes

815
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,559
it's fun because you can just make it

816
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
making cool dashboard graphically i've

817
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
got some data but it has to be data

818
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,200
that's actually helpful and likes it

819
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
demonstrates the impact and helps make

820
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,440
helps them make decisions yeah because

821
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,360
it should be you can have a dashboard

822
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,480
for you but you also need to have a

823
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,440
dashboard for others

824
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,200
sure

825
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,559
another thing you think about key risk

826
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,320
indicators so you think about measuring

827
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
risk you know you can get it from us you

828
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
can measure through risk assessments in

829
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,720
other ways but another common op term is

830
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,559
indicators right so this is something

831
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,400
that might give you leading and lagging

832
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,960
indicators it might give you um

833
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
it lets you know risk might be happening

834
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,559
right it's another form of data you can

835
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,159
take into your risk assessment process

836
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,240
saying instead of high instead of you

837
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
know one to five i can look at some

838
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,960
metrics that say okay and my um

839
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,760
employee turnover risk

840
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,279
might be increasing based on the trends

841
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,679
and so the example of this this curious

842
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,960
integrator is interesting one i read

843
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
recently in cio magazine they talked

844
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
about employee turnover and um they

845
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,039
noticed organizations who had increased

846
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,760
pr employee turnover were also having

847
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
increase in data loss as the thought was

848
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
as employees are leaving the company you

849
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,679
know like a sales person for example

850
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,880
they're starting to take you know

851
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,720
customer information or whatever with

852
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
them on their way out the door and so

853
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
metric they were monitoring was employee

854
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
turnover and how that affected data loss

855
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
and how that affected their risk

856
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,080
and some of those you can you can see in

857
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
advance so for instance if you're

858
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,120
getting ready to do a big layoff then

859
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,480
you've got you got a bigger bigger

860
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
indicator uh but working from home i

861
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,000
mean that's that's one of those things

862
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
that

863
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,279
today we all understand it right but

864
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
when before covered it was crazy you

865
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
know when

866
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
we didn't see that coming and when it

867
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,640
when it came you know there's now all

868
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,080
the stuff and all the information and

869
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,159
all the data is now pushed out to your

870
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,880
home kids are in there who knows

871
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,240
so that's something you want to turn you

872
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,000
can if possible turn into a metric right

873
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
so percentage of my workforce working

874
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
from home or percentage my workforce has

875
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,200
access to you know whatever data working

876
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
from home may be an indicator of you

877
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,360
know potential risk my organization so

878
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
that's something else to think about um

879
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,760
and also an indicator is a good going

880
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,279
forward so everybody's trying to make

881
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
that decision do we call people back to

882
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,120
the house to the offices well if you

883
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
don't know what data load was lost or if

884
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
you don't know what risks were out there

885
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,320
you don't know whether it's better to

886
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
have them work from home or work from

887
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,480
here

888
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,919
yeah absolutely right what's important

889
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,559
to look at exactly

890
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,559
so i'll let you take this one

891
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
yeah we touched this earlier right but

892
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
um

893
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
you know instead of just showing up to

894
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
somebody you know and saying hey if you

895
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
don't do this you are you know a bad

896
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
person or you're foolish or whatever

897
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,520
right it's good to go back to the impact

898
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,080
right so um if you don't do this you

899
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,799
potential cost is x or the impact is why

900
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,399
right that's a much better way to

901
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,159
communicate the business another thing

902
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,640
that we um that's very helpful

903
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
um from the business perspective um i

904
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
think generally speaking from anyone's

905
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,880
perspective look at outside sources as

906
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
well and so i know my prior organization

907
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,279
we looked at for we use a com we used a

908
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,279
product called algo first a data service

909
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,799
it would give us a monthly or weekly

910
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
feed of incidents that happened across

911
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
the u.s um events and incidents right so

912
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,080
it might be

913
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,960
fraud fraud incidents financial crime or

914
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
cyber incidents right and so we as a

915
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,000
company we were challenged to make sure

916
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
we're monitoring those

917
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,399
even though we're doing our own things

918
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,760
that we think affect us we also have to

919
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
look at the outside and say okay what's

920
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
happening in industry or like-size

921
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
organizations what things are affecting

922
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,919
them what should we actually think about

923
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
what risks we consider that we're not

924
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
and make sure we have programs in place

925
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,159
to consider those

926
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,240
and in regards to a similar example

927
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,960
right yeah and i recently i had a

928
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,240
customer who

929
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,799
was going through a breach and the the

930
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
president was like it's not a big deal

931
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,840
you know

932
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
we found data that was

933
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
needed to be reported to a federal

934
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
agency and they're like no it's okay we

935
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,200
we don't believe it's the same data and

936
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
i was just floored

937
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,440
so i reached out to another client who

938
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,279
had been through the same incident and

939
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,880
said hey would you mind

940
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,559
talking to them under anonymity or

941
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,760
whatever he said i have no problem

942
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
talking you know so they ended up kind

943
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,399
of communicating and you know it's

944
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
just having that experience for another

945
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,159
person helped to kind of change the

946
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,200
mindset

947
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,039
so having that access to outside

948
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
confirmation or just information is very

949
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,799
helpful so in a sense if you're you're

950
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,559
trying to convince your um chief risk

951
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
officer about a potential risk in the

952
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
cyberspace and he's like i don't get it

953
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,799
but if you can say

954
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
i've heard deutsche bank had the same

955
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
problem citibank had the same problem

956
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,919
show concrete examples of how it

957
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,480
affected them then suddenly your cro or

958
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
whomever might think or the cfo is going

959
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
to budget but i think oh i guess you

960
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
better think about if it's happening to

961
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
other organizations like us that's a

962
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
good way to provide substance for your

963
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
argument or your request and then also i

964
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,960
remember doing a risk assessment we

965
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
looked at crime area right so if the if

966
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,200
the crime in that area goes up you have

967
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,640
a better potential you know if you're a

968
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
physical security person you have a

969
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
better potential

970
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
risk of something happening

971
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
so um kind of the key takeaways you know

972
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,679
they always say you you hope for four

973
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
points and people may walk around with

974
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,440
one right so the four points is is speak

975
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
the language you know most critically

976
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
important is is to speak the same

977
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
language have the same metrics have the

978
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,919
same conversations that they're doing

979
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,320
and and do the math so

980
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
again if you if you have a risk level

981
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
you need to kind of show them how that

982
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,000
risk level came up what what was the

983
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,679
calculation that got there

984
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,480
um

985
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
you know if you don't have the math in

986
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,840
in grade school they would give you a

987
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
nap you know because you had to shift

988
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,799
math to show you knew how to do the

989
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
problem and then being be inclusive

990
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,760
right and matt and i have talked about

991
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,679
before so security should be like

992
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,200
neighborhood watch right your whole

993
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,559
organization be part should be part of

994
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,120
security um so you want them to be

995
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,960
involved right so create a culture of

996
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
collaboration versus fear and scaring

997
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
them away from working with you

998
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
um i think that one recommendation one

999
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,399
recognition i would have is

1000
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
make the business feel it's okay to

1001
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
basically report a false positive if

1002
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
they come to you with a problem it's not

1003
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,960
really a problem don't like belittle

1004
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,799
them or you know make them feel bad for

1005
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,720
reporting it say thanks for coming to me

1006
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
and speaking to me and explain to them

1007
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080
that way the next time you they might

1008
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,279
find a real problem they're still

1009
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
comfortable coming to you so there's a

1010
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
there's a great story that just happened

1011
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
recently in missouri i don't know if you

1012
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
guys have read about that hack

1013
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,640
so um a reporter noticed on a missouri

1014
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,559
website that if you right-mouse clicked

1015
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,840
on the code you could read the social

1016
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,760
security numbers of all the teachers

1017
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,240
so so the reporter reported it to the

1018
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
agency and said hey we're gonna give you

1019
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,600
a few months to fix a few weeks to fix

1020
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,760
it and then we're going to run a story

1021
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,480
well

1022
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
they fixed it kind of but then when they

1023
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,000
were in a story

1024
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,159
the governor is now

1025
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,600
filing charges against the reporter

1026
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,679
that's nuts to me first of all html

1027
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,200
code's free

1028
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
it's you're hacking you're just it's

1029
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
like saying i broke into a park you know

1030
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,559
you just walked in

1031
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,399
so uh but you know that but that's

1032
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
that's crazy to me because as a state

1033
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,880
agency like who's gonna report it google

1034
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
facebook all those places are now like

1035
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
hey if you report stuff to us and we see

1036
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
it we'll give you money right there's a

1037
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,919
reward program because it makes more

1038
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
sense to do it

1039
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,720
and then metrics not emotions because a

1040
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,799
lot of times we can get frustrated we

1041
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,360
can be like why do you not see this you

1042
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,159
know what how are you so blind

1043
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,080
we need money to fix this or else this

1044
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,279
is going to happen

1045
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,039
but the reality is that's an emotion and

1046
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,600
not not a metric right so we have to

1047
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
make sure that we understand like is

1048
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
this truly going to happen

1049
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,519
we don't really control anything right i

1050
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,279
do say though um

1051
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,720
you know i always use the example of i

1052
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
have a pre-sales team in uh

1053
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
china and russia i don't pay them i

1054
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
don't know who they are but they they're

1055
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,519
busy right so but to understand when

1056
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,519
they're going to attack i have no idea

1057
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,679
you know i i can't make that up so to

1058
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,039
understand the metrics of just the risk

1059
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,399
value is more important than actually

1060
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,919
getting the emotion of you have to do

1061
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
this

1062
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,399
and then last but not least be objective

1063
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,880
um it's really hard for us to know our

1064
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
strengths and

1065
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,480
to spot a blind spot right

1066
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
um but if i'm a physical security person

1067
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,159
or if i came up from this technical

1068
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,279
background

1069
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
i'm definitely going to lean more

1070
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,559
towards that right if most of my career

1071
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,240
was spent in this area

1072
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,039
um

1073
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
having outside counsel and i i i say you

1074
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,679
know go talk so i have a buddy of mine

1075
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,080
who's fbi and i go have lunch with him i

1076
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,840
hear all kinds of trends from him and i

1077
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,679
also you know kind of runs up by him

1078
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,960
he's like you're an idiot did you not

1079
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,040
think about and i'm like no

1080
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,719
yeah it's really helpful sometimes just

1081
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
to have an outside party objective come

1082
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,239
and look what you're doing and just

1083
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
proactively invite them in say here's my

1084
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,839
program explain to them and get their

1085
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,040
thoughts right so you can kind of get

1086
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
ahead of your own blind spots before

1087
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,480
your management team does or you know or

1088
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,159
something happens to you right

1089
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,040
and

1090
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
embrace and accept weakness right

1091
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,440
because i had a one guy called me said

1092
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
hey look we'd like a penetration test uh

1093
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,399
or a vulnerability scan and by the way i

1094
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,679
passed all the other ones with perfect

1095
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,399
cutlery like perfect scores and i'm like

1096
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,560
oh so you you want me to

1097
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
give you an a like that how does that

1098
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
help it's like going to the doctor and

1099
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
saying how are you feeling oh i'm great

1100
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,560
while you have cancer right it's just

1101
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,918
not helpful he's not going to be able to

1102
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,639
help you so being able to to actually go

1103
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,480
out and tell the truth and

1104
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,839
work with it

1105
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,200
and again committees can help so um

1106
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,960
bringing those those organizations those

1107
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,480
stakeholders in that's who you're trying

1108
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,400
to protect right the stakeholders data

1109
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
the stakeholders you know whatever it is

1110
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,079
who those people are is who you're

1111
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,280
trying to protect so bring them in on

1112
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,800
that conversation see if they have

1113
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
concerns i'm doing a presentation in san

1114
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,280
antonio

1115
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,640
in december

1116
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,839
and what we're doing is we're sending

1117
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,520
out a survey so that we know what the

1118
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,280
risks are and then that way the

1119
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
conversation will be about what they are

1120
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
afraid of not what i think they're

1121
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
afraid of yeah i think it's a great

1122
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
example we have a client who had

1123
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,800
incident recently and um they didn't do

1124
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
they didn't include the rest of the

1125
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,160
business so they had a technical person

1126
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,640
spot the problem the cso and then work

1127
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
together to solve it but they didn't

1128
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,000
talk to the actual risk holder before

1129
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
they did it right so something that the

1130
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
the cso and his team thought well

1131
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
something we took care of actually was a

1132
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,599
pretty significant risk to business

1133
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,839
holder in their eyes and so talk to them

1134
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
about it right you're responding an

1135
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
incident that affects someone else have

1136
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
them on the team right have them help

1137
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,760
have them help you understand what the

1138
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
actual risk is beyond just a technical

1139
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,720
solution

1140
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,959
yeah

1141
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,320
and with that

1142
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,040
any questions

1143
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,440
sure

1144
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,520
i was curious i you know i think these

1145
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
strategies are great i've used some of

1146
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,800
them before presented management trying

1147
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,640
to get budget and things like that one

1148
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
thing i've been asked for never had a

1149
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,680
good answer was

1150
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
um

1151
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,920
like indexing against similar companies

1152
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
right right oh how many should we have

1153
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,680
how much budget should we have

1154
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
do you guys have any resources that you

1155
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,720
use for that sort of thing

1156
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
there are some resources out there i've

1157
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,400
been seeing it more and more and that's

1158
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
why also infragard is a good

1159
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
organization to join

1160
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,000
it's i guess it's mainly focused on

1161
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,520
critical infrastructure but they pretty

1162
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
much lie to me by end i mean they let me

1163
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,640
in

1164
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
but uh but it's it's one of those things

1165
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,920
that it's important to kind of have that

1166
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
safe area that you can talk the other

1167
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,800
thing is talk to cso groups right so and

1168
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,520
you

1169
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,359
you can talk to them about budget and

1170
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,280
keep it anonymous but at least you're

1171
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,119
right you do get metrics and markers

1172
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,200
because some people spend a lot of money

1173
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
and some people people spend a little

1174
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,000
bit of money

1175
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,640
and

1176
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,119
to me i think that's your next business

1177
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,599
is start building those metrics because

1178
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,520
knowing you know this company spent

1179
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
twenty thousand dollars and got breached

1180
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
five times versus a company that spent a

1181
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,480
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and

1182
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,079
got breached once you know that would be

1183
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,400
a very valuable important entry that's

1184
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,760
kind of challenging because i think in

1185
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,640
other

1186
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,560
parts of the business like in the um

1187
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,079
financial space or whatever it's pretty

1188
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,599
common for a like-size organization to

1189
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,800
get together and share thoughts right

1190
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,240
have working groups and they're they can

1191
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,599
share information they're competitors

1192
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,440
but they kind of work together

1193
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
yeah yeah but in the cyber space you

1194
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
don't really want to share a lot as much

1195
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
right it's a little more private so it's

1196
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,359
harder to find those

1197
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,640
similar companies that want to like sit

1198
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,240
down and have that conversation with you

1199
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,520
it's a little bit more challenging so it

1200
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,040
is helpful to look

1201
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,760
outside we use example for guard and i i

1202
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
use example of i'll go first you can see

1203
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,839
a report sometimes anonymous sometimes

1204
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,200
actually comes information companies

1205
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,040
information around the reports the

1206
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,800
actual loss and what the cost was to

1207
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
them and so that's that's there but i

1208
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,079
think to matt's point if you can solve

1209
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
that problem that's you'll have a great

1210
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
business

1211
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,480
a business right there because it is an

1212
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,839
important metric you're right

1213
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
yes sir you mentioned business impact

1214
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,320
assessments is that more of an expanded

1215
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,240
view of like what a business impact

1216
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,839
analysis is where you have like yeah

1217
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,920
they invite core business functions rtos

1218
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
rpos yeah sort of thing yeah that part

1219
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,200
of that overall process would be more

1220
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,359
expanded or yeah

1221
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,119
yeah yeah in the business community

1222
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,560
space right so

1223
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,320
most businesses have all their processes

1224
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,720
documented from a to b i do accounting

1225
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,920
they do all the things they do as a

1226
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,760
business i have a process documented for

1227
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,440
them and each one of those processes if

1228
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
it's done right should have a business

1229
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,920
impact assessment associated with the

1230
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,400
right so i have a bia for my particular

1231
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
process i'm a process owner in

1232
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
accounting i charge the accounting

1233
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,720
process i know what my bia is and so if

1234
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,920
something happens to me i should have

1235
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,839
that assessment you know done

1236
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,839
periodically so i can communicate that

1237
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,599
risk and know what it is and so i think

1238
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,680
it is a broader term right it should be

1239
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,079
happening across the organization

1240
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,160
and and the financial people are a

1241
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
really good asset and resource because

1242
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,720
they have been doing i mean

1243
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,320
since the dawn of time right since money

1244
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,680
has been invented

1245
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
people are like i don't trust you money

1246
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,359
i'm going to get a second third you know

1247
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
they have been doing

1248
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,520
third party evaluations that nobody they

1249
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
have separation of duties they've been

1250
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
doing all this stuff since day one and

1251
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
they have a lot of experience to

1252
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,040
tracking every single dollar

1253
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,960
utilizing and leveraging that experience

1254
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,240
and bringing them into the risk

1255
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,839
organization and maybe even including

1256
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,440
them in a risk assessment right because

1257
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,800
they go through sock too they go through

1258
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
their older financial audits on a

1259
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,640
regular basis they're used to audits um

1260
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,920
when you when you hit some of these

1261
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,079
other uh organizations and other

1262
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,119
stakeholders

1263
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
they don't like audits they're like why

1264
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,160
are you asking me about how much this

1265
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,560
process is and what this entails so

1266
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,160
utilizing leveraging that internal

1267
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,599
talent that you have at the organization

1268
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,400
can be important

1269
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,400
any other questions

1270
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,599
okay

1271
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,280
