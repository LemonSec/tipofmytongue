00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,720
morning everybody thank you for coming

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,960
out uh thank you for supporting owasp i

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,840
really enjoy a wasp i was fortunate

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,199
enough to be involved when oas got

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,240
started

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,439
i was fortunate enough to be in the

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,840
wrong place at the right time and

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,640
when

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
mark curfey bailed uh i was

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,280
left to be the global chair for the

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,440
first 10 years of oas but it's an

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,200
amazing organization

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
uh it's been

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
easily the most rewarding thing that

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
i've participated in in my career it's

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
helped me grow immensely and i made a

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
ton of great connections over the years

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,760
so i

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
thank you for supporting it it's uh it's

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,760
really cool organization

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
um

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,960
so

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
this is a new talk for me so i really

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
need a lot of like you know uh moral

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,119
support from the crowd so uh we'll give

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,240
this a try and see how it goes um

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
but uh

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,119
you know i've been doing appsec since

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
the late 90s i accidentally got into

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
apsec i happened to be a developer who

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
was working in security in the late 90s

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,720
and ge came to the i was working at

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,159
exodus communications if you're a big

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,680
data center company during the dot-com

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,479
boom it's gone now

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
and ge came to us and said hey we need

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,520
every line of code reviewed before it

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,240
goes on the internet for security and

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
everyone's like uh sure we can do that

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,240
and

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,920
i got the call to do that so i built one

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,360
of the first apsec

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
teams ever and we looked at all the code

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
for like the internet startups during

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
that time yeah you know hotbot and

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
united health group and a whole bunch of

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
other like uh really early internet

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
adapters and it just but i just got

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
stuck in apsec uh so i'm still here

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320
waiting to get back to be a developer

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
again

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,560
uh so i think this talk is you know this

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
is a keynote talk so i tried to bring it

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,360
up a level and you know share my wisdom

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,239
over

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
20 years in this field uh i'd really

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
love your feedback on this uh so let's

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,720
get started so um

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
the first thing is i know you all know

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
this uh what we do here

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,640
securing software is critically

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,920
important

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
it's actually number four on the world

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
economic forum list of stuff that will

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
probably destroy the planet behind

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,599
infectious disease and

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
climate you know

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,239
what they call uncontrolled weather

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,680
things like that

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
it's really important problem and so

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
almost everything that matters in life

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
is now controlled by software

74
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,879
and as we'll see we're not very good at

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
writing secure software um

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
so

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,519
i guess i'd want to challenge you

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,360
you guys probably all bank online you

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
probably use uh healthcare and

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
government and so on what do you know

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
about the security of that software

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
there's a lot of shaken headline i don't

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
know when you sign up for a bank do you

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,840
get to find out like who wrote the code

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
or did they test it for security

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
or do they use libraries from you know

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,959
1982

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,959
you don't know anything about that

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
software it's completely blind trust

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
blind trust drives me absolutely bat

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,840
 crazy

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,599
it's the dumbest possible thing like you

93
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,680
never take risks without like some

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
insight that's for like you know

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,080
there's uh extreme mountain bikers that

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
are you know flying off cliffs and stuff

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
that's not what we should be doing with

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
stuff that's this critical

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
so

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
we know that there's a massive

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
disconnect between

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
what people expect from software

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
and what's really there

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
the gulf is huge and you can tell

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
because what happens every time there's

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
a breach

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
people go crazy they're outraged right

108
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,120
it

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,079
congress is outraged and uh you know

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
consumers are outraged the wall street

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,519
journal is outraged everybody's out how

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
could this happen

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
we have to fire the cso

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
but you and i know we've been in the

115
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
trenches we've seen the software we know

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,199
it's all like that every application is

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,600
full of vulnerabilities

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
i quoted some stats yesterday it's like

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,199
you know the average app has like 30

120
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,600
serious vulnerabilities in it

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
it's all solar winds out there it's all

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
equifax

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
and this outrage tells you that there's

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
a there's a communication problem

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
we don't have a shared vision here

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,199
so

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,440
uh

128
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,960
i think the core

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
is that we're not answering the question

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,880
the big question

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,039
is are we secure

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,720
we do all this stuff

133
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
like i wrote here we tested all the

134
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,560
things with ospinist and the fuzzing and

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
found some crazy scary stuff and it's

136
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,759
all in this pdf report and we used

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,880
actual tools lots of tools and on and on

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,479
but like at the end it's like and thank

139
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
god we were here or it would have been a

140
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
freaking disaster

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,360
but at the end of that

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
you still don't know about whether

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
something's secure or not

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,039
and that's the problem we're not

145
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,840
actually answering the question

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,639
so

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,639
uh

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
buying software is like buying a used

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,560
car

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
you buy a used car you really don't know

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
what happened in that car before you

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
bought it right

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,919
could have all kinds of problems could

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,479
have a bent frame bad engine piston blew

155
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,960
up whatever you don't know it's a blind

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
transaction and that's why you get

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,840
 money for selling a used car

158
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
in the used car market now that's a

159
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
simple way of of talking about this

160
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
thing called the market for lemons a guy

161
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,039
named george ackerloff wrote a paper

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
about this 30 years ago 20 30 years ago

163
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
and won a nobel prize for this he said

164
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
markets where buyers and sellers don't

165
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
share the same information

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
are broken it's a fundamental market

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
flaw it's called asymmetric information

168
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
and it causes markets to tip

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
and

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
when we have market failures

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,280
something has to change in the market

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
like we can't just you know

173
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,639
keep trying harder what we're doing now

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
to fix this market it's never we're

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
swimming upstream against market forces

176
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,800
here that are preventing security from

177
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
happening

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
so you know owasp's mission

179
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,199
uh from when i was in charge oh that's

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
mission was to make application security

181
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
visible so that people can make informed

182
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
decisions about application security

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,199
risk specifically because of this we

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,280
want to try to fix the market

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,039
because if we fix the market everything

186
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,680
else will be easy we won't be fighting

187
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
to get people to pay attention to appsec

188
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
we won't have the same vulnerabilities

189
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
in the aus top 10 for 20 years

190
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
i wrote the first os top 10 in 2002 it's

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
19 years

192
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,919
and

193
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
there's still roughly the same number of

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
phones in in apps but even worse it's

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
the same vulnerabilities

196
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
20 years later we haven't i mean look i

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,560
love all the stuff that people do at oh

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,639
us there's tons of cool tools and tons

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,720
of interesting projects by really smart

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
dedicated people

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
but

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,720
nothing's changed

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
so

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,440
uh

205
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,520
you might say hold up jeff

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,400
wait a second slow your roll buddy uh

207
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
we're doing all this stuff

208
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,160
we've got all these best practices

209
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
there's like open sand we've got like a

210
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,080
hundred practices in it we're doing a

211
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
bunch of them we're spending millions of

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
dollars on apsec

213
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,479
uh

214
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,639
but

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
the evidence shows it's not working

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
we're not stamping out classes of

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,120
vulnerabilities we're not making

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
progress in the os top 10 like i kind of

219
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
thought we'd you know

220
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,759
fix a few of those things in the os top

221
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,560
10 and like raise the bar over time

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
but it's still just the same stuff

223
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,840
that's crazy i want to make things

224
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,919
actually better for my kids and yours

225
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,319
and everybody so

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,840
is it crazy

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
to think that maybe just maybe hear me

228
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
out here compliance guy uh hear me out

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
maybe

230
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
these things don't work

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
and i know if you're like if you're in

232
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,440
security you're probably like but i

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
gotta have my security requirements how

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
can we do anything without requirements

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,839
well

236
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,320
i don't know

237
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
it feels right to me like i love all of

238
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
these things i've done all of these for

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
20 years i'm really good at a lot of

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
these things

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,640
but

242
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600
i'm i'm starting to doubt myself

243
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
i've written tons of like secure coding

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
guidelines for companies but i don't

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
think they really read them i don't

246
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
think they're affecting the developers

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
and i bet you if you ask them they will

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
tell you like i don't know

249
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,319
so

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
this is really unpopular opinion because

251
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,440
these things are like orthodoxy to

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
security folks security folks are locked

253
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
in to a very waterfall mindset

254
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,959
requirements

255
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,760
well

256
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
threat modeling maybe security

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,880
architecture

258
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
implement

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,519
test

260
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,120
deliver and monitor

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
very

262
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
strict thinking around that

263
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
so

264
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,760
uh

265
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
i i you might ask like well how do

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,000
we how do we get out of this who do we

267
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,880
blame

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
who can we hold responsible for this and

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
actually there's just nobody to blame i

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,399
really want you to think about changing

271
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,680
the game

272
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,440
that's the words of ice-t don't hate the

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,240
player don't sue the developer

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,040
uh

275
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
don't blame the cso

276
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
blame the game it's broken right now so

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,880
i'm focused on trying to fix the game

278
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
i think application security is at a

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
crossroads on the one side we can keep

280
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
trying this waterfall-based siloed

281
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
approach

282
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,839
expert driven approach to appsec that's

283
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
slow and expensive and has never worked

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
very well that is option a

285
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
on the other side

286
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,240
we could reimagine the work

287
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
here

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,560
think about a way of doing application

289
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,600
security so it answers the question

290
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
and also it's you can deliver it as part

291
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,399
of a normal development process

292
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,760
let's make it natural so i'm going to

293
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
try to explore that idea and i don't

294
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,800
have the solution i have some ideas

295
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
about the solution so

296
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
work with me help me flesh this out

297
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,880
i do know that

298
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
we're so attached to those practices

299
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
that i had on the last slide

300
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,839
that

301
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
it's going to be really difficult to

302
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,040
change the direction of this battleship

303
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
uh

304
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,160
i and i just had this weird thought i

305
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,360
was like

306
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,519
what if the biggest risk to application

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,040
security

308
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,120
is the fact that we can't give up

309
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
security requirements and those other

310
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,160
practices

311
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
what if that's actually the biggest risk

312
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,079
that'd be very ironic that security

313
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
people are now essentially their mindset

314
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,480
is essentially the biggest risk to us

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
making change so i want you to you know

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
for the next 20 minutes or so free your

317
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,160
mind and let's let's try this

318
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
so

319
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,399
uh

320
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,079
i thought that um

321
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,000
i really thought that security would

322
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
reinvent the work of

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
of application security

324
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,680
uh

325
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
the way that devops

326
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
did devops reinvented the work of

327
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
building software

328
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,240
they said hey instead of trying to do

329
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,160
these big monolithic things like you

330
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
know

331
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
requirements and architecture and build

332
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
and test instead they broke that down

333
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
into little pieces and they got those

334
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
little pieces flowing quickly from

335
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,240
development into production very high

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
cadence tight feedback loops a culture

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,399
of experimentation and learning and i

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,440
was like

339
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
holy crap that's exactly what we need to

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
do in security

341
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
we need to break down these big

342
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,800
monolithic tasks all those activities

343
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,240
that i show on that other slide into

344
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
little pieces get them focused get that

345
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
work flowing into production in a very

346
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
measurable way i was like hey this could

347
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
be this could be it

348
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
it's devsecops

349
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
but unfortunately that's not

350
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,079
really what happened in fact actually

351
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
devsecops has sort of come to mean

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,120
do the same exact thing

353
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,120
except make developers do it

354
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,160
i actually call that left sorry

355
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,519
but

356
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,200
we need something so like we're looking

357
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
for something here

358
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
this this little solution space we need

359
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
something that we can build something

360
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
concrete that we can build that answers

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
the question

362
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
right are we secure

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
and

364
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
it needs to be something that we can

365
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,200
measure and share and improve

366
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,720
that's how we're going to make progress

367
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
here is we're going to capture something

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
and then iterate on it make it better

369
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
and better over time just like we do

370
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
with software

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,519
so i'm gonna start really small i'm

372
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
gonna explore this idea start really

373
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,519
small and then we'll build up uh so to

374
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,639
me

375
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,839
security is essentially an

376
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,000
argument you ask are we secure i have to

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
make my case right

378
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
i've got to provide some

379
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
arguments

380
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
that would establish that i'm secure so

381
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,880
how do we capture that argument

382
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,199
well here's how i think about it the

383
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,320
first step

384
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
is is like threat modeling but much more

385
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
like an iterative little piece we just

386
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
want to do one

387
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
uh sprint if you will right we want to

388
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,279
capture what like what's your biggest

389
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,279
risk we don't have to figure out all the

390
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,240
risks

391
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
we just need to know like what the

392
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
biggest one is and we're going to tackle

393
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
that one first why would you start with

394
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
anything else actually like why would

395
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
you work on the little stuff first and

396
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,519
that's actually the problem with

397
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
security requirements go read those

398
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,880
things there's zillions of requirements

399
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,959
that most of which don't matter

400
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,760
log injection i don't know who cares

401
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
it's if you're dealing with you know

402
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,079
expression language injection and xxc

403
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,839
and things that matter like you're never

404
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
going to get to those so i want to focus

405
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,199
on things that matter and what that'll

406
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,320
end up doing is eliminating like 80 of

407
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
the work

408
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,040
that we're doing which doesn't

409
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,480
contribute to this argument well i'll

410
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
come back to that in a second so

411
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,839
uh let's imagine that our it doesn't

412
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,519
matter what the risk we choose like as

413
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,720
far as i'm concerned we're going to

414
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,079
choose the first risk and that's our

415
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
threat model i don't know what it is

416
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,360
it's different for everybody if you're

417
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
building planes or mobile phones or

418
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,399
satellites or factories or whatever it

419
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,519
doesn't matter

420
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,839
your first risk let's say it's click

421
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,760
jacking it's almost definitely not but

422
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,959
let's just imagine that it's click

423
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,240
jacking

424
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
because that in my case that's what i

425
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,360
care about so

426
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
my first step is to identify that

427
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
and start working on it i'm going to

428
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
make a sprint around that so you see

429
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
here this diagram i used

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,000
it's essentially a tree but see it's

431
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
wrapped in a circle so now it's really

432
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
cool

433
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,600
okay

434
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,440
so the first step is like the question

435
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
right am i secure around that i usually

436
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
break down a threat model by big major

437
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
components like here's the web piece

438
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
here's the client piece here's the back

439
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,959
end and so on so that's what that layer

440
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,639
is but then

441
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,720
let's let's identify threads you don't

442
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
have to break it down that way you can

443
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,279
structure an argument a lot of different

444
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
ways but that's the threat modeling

445
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
pieces like let's get the big threat and

446
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
then look this is like a proof by

447
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,440
induction okay we're gonna do one

448
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
and then we're gonna show that we can do

449
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,199
it for multiple risks by repeating it

450
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,720
and we're gonna

451
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
trend towards a really complete

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
not just threat model but a whole

453
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,800
security argument the threat model is

454
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
just the core

455
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
of the argument

456
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,079
there's the next layers is what matters

457
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,839
so first we've identified the threat

458
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,519
so the next step is we got to choose a

459
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
defense strategy

460
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
i don't i don't like to say you know

461
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,199
counter measure or like it's really a

462
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
defense strategy it's not

463
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
uh one defense it's probably at least a

464
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
primary defense and a secondary defense

465
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,600
but you should talk about that like what

466
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,519
do we do about click jacking

467
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,680
so i'll throw it out to the crowd what

468
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,719
do we do about click checking

469
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,279
what would a good defense against that

470
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,839
be

471
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,040
great

472
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
don't use what

473
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,759
i'm sorry i can't hear you

474
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
don't use iframe okay well the problem

475
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
is iframe is like the attacker is using

476
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,519
the iframe not you but you're right

477
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,360
you're on the right track uh that'll be

478
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
great if we could eliminate all use of

479
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
iframes

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,199
uh we'd probably be in a lot better

481
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
shape click jacking wise

482
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
but your idea is really good like let's

483
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,199
set an x-frame options header on every

484
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
outbound request you could use csp or

485
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
some other things but nobody uses that

486
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
so the ship is sale

487
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
um

488
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,160
so let's say we want x frame options

489
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,919
right maybe our backup defense is like

490
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
we could put in a some kind of intrusion

491
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
detector that says hey if somebody's

492
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,679
accessing pages without going through

493
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,280
like the right flow

494
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,240
uh

495
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,400
that might indicate an x-frame options

496
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
attack i'm sorry a click-jacking attack

497
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
in progress so we can imagine like sort

498
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,720
of different layers of defense okay

499
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
that's cool that's my strategy

500
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
now i can go build it right developers

501
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
can go make that happen

502
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
and we're going to need some evidence

503
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
that this thing actually works so this

504
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
is like the third step right you got to

505
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,840
know that your defenses are correct and

506
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,200
effective that's what security testing

507
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
is all about it's not about running a

508
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
tool

509
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
it's not about creating a pdf file it's

510
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
not about managing vulnerabilities

511
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
it's about verifying that your defenses

512
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,720
actually do what you want them to do

513
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
those other things are just maybe parts

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,000
of the evidence that you could use

515
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
to support that argument

516
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
so

517
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,640
most security testing doesn't support

518
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
this

519
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,000
like most security testing is wasted

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
effort i see people testing for sql

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
injection on apps that don't have a

522
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
database

523
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,840
i don't know

524
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
probably not a great use of your time

525
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,640
but so much of this is wasted effort

526
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
tools that you don't actually most

527
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,760
people don't know what the tool is

528
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
testing for anyway

529
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
if you don't you should really check out

530
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
the os benchmark project it's a cool

531
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
project that really tries to show what

532
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
tools are good at what they're bad at

533
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
and frankly that's what you need in

534
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
order to say if you want to use you know

535
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
some evidence that says well i ran

536
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
contrast on this you ought to know what

537
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
contrast is actually really good at

538
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,880
testing

539
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
that's how you can tell whether this is

540
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
a good argument or not but look if if

541
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
your tests don't contribute to this

542
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,240
just don't do them just stop it doesn't

543
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,120
matter

544
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
if you've got requirements that don't

545
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,799
you know match help support this

546
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
argument don't do them

547
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
so

548
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,720
uh

549
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,200
at uh at the end so

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
it would be great if when people ask the

551
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
question like are we secure you had an

552
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,039
answer for them and it could be a more

553
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
specific version of are you secure like

554
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
are we protected against clickjacking

555
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,760
you should be able to answer that

556
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
question immediately

557
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,840
and so for clickjacking you'd say well

558
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,080
yeah we we identified that threat here's

559
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,760
our defense strategy and here's the

560
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,600
evidence that shows that we're correct

561
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
and effective in our defense so you'd

562
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
have evidence that shows like hey i

563
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,919
don't know for clickjacking you might

564
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
watch every outbound request from your

565
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,000
system you could put in a filter you

566
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
could use zap for it there's a bunch of

567
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,360
ways of testing it you make sure every

568
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
single response has the next frame

569
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
options header

570
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,760
great that's the evidence that you need

571
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,360
to show this and then you can very

572
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
quickly explain are we secure on any

573
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,080
dimension that matters and then

574
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,840
that should answer the mail yeah we're

575
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,919
secure as a ciso that's what i would

576
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
love to have

577
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
i think as consumers they would love to

578
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,039
have a version of that

579
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,400
so

580
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
that's the theory and

581
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,559
all this is good theory but i want to

582
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,240
try to make this a little practical so i

583
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,559
have some advice on

584
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,960
uh different aspects of this process

585
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
that you may find helpful so

586
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,039
uh the first thing

587
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,080
is

588
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,480
i want you to reevaluate all those

589
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
activities that we talked about and

590
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
imagine how they map into this argument

591
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,919
by the way this diagram is generated by

592
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,840
a tool like kiala

593
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,799
it's

594
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,320
a tool that's designed to help you

595
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,919
manage an argument

596
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,039
and you can go on there and you can

597
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
debate anything you want uh you know

598
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
should

599
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,919
i i don't know is wheat bread better

600
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,840
than white bread like there's there's

601
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
debates on everything but you can manage

602
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,159
the debate and you can see

603
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,880
in each of those boxes there's like uh a

604
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
way of balancing the pro claims and the

605
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,480
the con claims

606
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,919
so that you can see like sort of who's

607
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
winning the argument uh it has a voting

608
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,400
system so you can evaluate those claims

609
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
and say like oh yeah that that piece of

610
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
evidence is really compelling this other

611
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,679
piece not so much but i encourage you to

612
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
manage both positive and negative

613
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
evidence here

614
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
sometimes you're going to get a test

615
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,960
result that says that failed we don't

616
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
put the xframe options header on some

617
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,880
request

618
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,760
uh our response so you know that's

619
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,039
that's a great piece of evidence that

620
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,440
proves that we didn't meet our security

621
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,480
argument

622
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
so it's useful to manage both sides of

623
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
it it's not either all negative like a

624
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
pen test result

625
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,440
or all positive like uh maybe an audit

626
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
or i don't know uh there's some some

627
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,000
piece of evidence that shows like here's

628
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
how the

629
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
controls work it's both

630
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
managing the argument is your job as

631
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,039
security folks

632
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
so when i think about

633
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
using this approach in a modern software

634
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
pipeline i think well hey that's cool

635
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,799
like that pipeline can throw off tons of

636
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,360
evidence really efficiently that can

637
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
support my argument so you know you can

638
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,120
automatically map output from some of

639
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
these stages maybe really early on you

640
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:20,799
want to have some tool that looks for

641
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,080
hard-coded passwords because they're

642
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
easy to find in source code

643
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,799
other things that are harder to find in

644
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,480
source code like data flow problems

645
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
maybe you want to do that later

646
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
uh

647
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
and

648
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,039
maybe you want to include some evidence

649
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
from production that says hey you know

650
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
what we are never getting hit with any

651
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,520
xx attacks that's like a useful piece of

652
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,280
information to balance into this when

653
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
you're prioritizing the the arguments

654
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
that you're dealing with but

655
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it's not about shifting left i think

656
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,799
shifting left is a really

657
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,640
simplistic way of thinking about things

658
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
shifting left comes not from security

659
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,320
community by the way comes from the test

660
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
the you know the development community

661
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,360
just shifting qa earlier

662
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
security is a little bit different

663
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,159
uh

664
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,640
in some ways i think uh there's a lot of

665
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,880
cases when shifting right is the right

666
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,480
thing to do really what you want to do

667
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,679
is shift smart

668
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,200
shift to the place

669
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,960
in the process where the test that you

670
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,000
want to do

671
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
is

672
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
fast and easy and accurate and

673
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,039
compelling and i underlined accurate

674
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,520
because accurate is so important

675
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,799
every time you do something that's

676
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,000
inaccurate

677
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
you have to have experts involved

678
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
if it's inaccurate that means there's

679
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,200
either false positives or false

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
negatives

681
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,799
and so if it's inaccurate you have to

682
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
have experts involved and that's going

683
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,039
to slow down your process

684
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,400
you can't have a human-based process

685
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
in a pipeline that has to finish in 15

686
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,960
minutes like that's a typical sla for a

687
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
development pipeline

688
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
so

689
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,600
our goal today

690
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,360
for and for the next few years is going

691
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,240
to be taking anything that's

692
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
human involved human in the critical

693
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,240
path and eliminating it we have to get

694
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,840
it out of this because software is

695
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,159
moving way faster than security we're

696
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,919
getting farther behind even though os

697
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,360
was making progress we're getting

698
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
farther behind because software is going

699
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,679
faster and faster

700
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,159
so a few things um about

701
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,559
testing here one thing i feel really

702
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,080
strongly about is

703
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
most of your best tests

704
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,240
are going to come from testing the the

705
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
fully assembled application as it's all

706
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,960
put together it's not just the source

707
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
code in some repo somewhere that's a

708
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
very limited view of the application

709
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,200
what's not there well a lot of stuff the

710
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,799
the app container that you're running is

711
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,840
like the

712
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,480
app server is not there the

713
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,080
runtime environment that you're using

714
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
and all the libraries associated with

715
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
that not there

716
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,799
the config and the backend connections

717
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,880
and the data are not there

718
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,799
so you really get this kind of limited

719
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,480
view of an application if you want to

720
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
find something like you know maybe a

721
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
library with a vulnerability in it

722
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,760
the place to measure that

723
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,559
is

724
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,000
after you've assembled the application

725
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,440
could be in a test environment it could

726
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
be a performance environment somewhere

727
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
where it's all built put together and

728
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,919
you've got data flowing through the

729
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,000
application i call that the runtime

730
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
reality

731
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
and it's important to test that runtime

732
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
reality because it's the most accurate

733
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,039
view there are some things that you can

734
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,440
accurately find in source code repos

735
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,880
it's just not a ton um

736
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
and again anytime

737
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
you know if it's not accurate

738
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,400
then you've got to you're going to

739
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
suffer false positives and false

740
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
negatives so like this is the most

741
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,039
accurate place to test a lot of things

742
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,200
so i encourage you

743
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,799
so you know getting back to the shift

744
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,320
left idea

745
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
some of the idea there is to

746
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,080
shift it earlier in the process so that

747
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
it's cheaper to fix at that point but if

748
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,679
the whole pipeline only takes 15 minutes

749
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,840
like if a developer checks in code and

750
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
15 minutes later you have this running

751
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,360
tests

752
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,440
it doesn't really matter right you can

753
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,279
get security feedback to the developer

754
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,880
really quickly but you're taking

755
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
advantage of the runtime reality

756
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
so that's that's why i think this is

757
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,600
important

758
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,320
next thing is

759
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
to optimize for learning so you look

760
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
developers are really good at building

761
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
things

762
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
and

763
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
they if you frame the work up right

764
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
they can do most of the stuff in

765
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
application security themselves

766
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
particularly on their applications if

767
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
you tell them what they need to produce

768
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
so optimizing for learning is

769
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
interesting it's not optimizing to to

770
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,919
for volume to find a ton of

771
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,320
vulnerabilities it's not optimizing for

772
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,279
speed even necessarily it's optimizing

773
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,760
for learning because what you want to do

774
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,559
is ultimately get to this ver this

775
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,960
vulnerability escape rate and bring that

776
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,320
down

777
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
most folks really most folks just

778
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
measure like how many vulnerabilities

779
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
did we find oh we found 50 or 500 or

780
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
whatever and that's a measure of success

781
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,720
that's a terrible measure of success

782
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
a better measure is mttr

783
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,799
which mean time to remediate like now

784
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,559
you're actually fixing vulnerabilities

785
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,080
that's better

786
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,400
and you can bring that rate down if you

787
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,840
look on this chart is actually pretty

788
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,679
accurate if you look at the blue line

789
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,039
that's a

790
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
static analysis

791
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
average mean time to remediate a static

792
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,240
analysis finding is 315 days in a large

793
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,320
complex organization

794
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,360
that's way too long and like the area

795
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
under this curve is

796
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,799
attack

797
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,480
window for attackers right so

798
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,080
we've with with ios we've been able to

799
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
push that line down to you know like

800
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
eight days

801
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,559
on average for vulnerabilities to get

802
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
fixed that's much better it's not as

803
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,720
good as it can be we we have seen some

804
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,600
organizations get to a single day

805
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
that's that's cool focus on mttr but

806
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,520
ultimately

807
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
ver the vulnerability escape rate is

808
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,039
better

809
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,279
that means the rate at which vulnerab

810
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
new vulnerabilities are being introduced

811
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
uh and it's it's based on the defect

812
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
escape rate which is a common term

813
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
developers use if we can get that number

814
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,840
down

815
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
that means all the work to find and fix

816
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,279
those other vulnerabilities goes away

817
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,320
so you're preventing these

818
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
vulnerabilities from existing in the

819
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
first place

820
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,159
that's where we want to be is where

821
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,679
we're not introducing lots of new

822
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,720
vulnerabilities so focus on your ver

823
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,559
how fast are you eliminating new

824
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,320
vulnerabilities and and we have seen big

825
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,159
organizations get down to less than one

826
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,840
new vulnerability per month

827
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
that's really powerful

828
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
that's a healthy program that's what i

829
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
mean by optimize for learning because

830
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,840
that's what reduces the effort

831
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,279
associated with apsec and frankly

832
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,360
there's not nearly enough abstech people

833
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
in the world to do all the work so we've

834
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,559
got to reduce the

835
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,039
the volume

836
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,880
um

837
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,240
so

838
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,600
one other thing that i think is really

839
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,279
important this is part of the part of

840
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,480
the argument

841
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
is you need runtime protection

842
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,720
uh

843
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
runtime protection identifies attacks

844
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
it'll show you who's attacking you what

845
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,679
vulnerable what attack vectors are using

846
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,360
which systems are targeting you need

847
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
that visibility if you want to do good

848
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
threat modeling

849
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
and you also

850
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
need to prevent those vulnerabilities

851
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,520
from being exploited and i wanted to

852
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
take a slight detour here just to

853
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
explain this and dave lindner here

854
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,080
here's going to give a talk about this

855
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,000
later today so you know

856
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,840
that would be a great thing to go to but

857
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,279
this is an example of expression

858
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,840
language injection it's the the kind of

859
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,320
law that took down equifax

860
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,120
it's uh the same flaw that was found in

861
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,360
uh atlassian confluence a couple weeks

862
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
ago it's a big deal

863
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,559
it's

864
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,799
a total host takeover

865
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,360
in like one http request

866
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
so it's really powerful and and it

867
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
always works uh sort of the same way the

868
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,360
attacker sends some malicious input

869
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,520
there's the red lines here

870
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,120
that input goes to an expression

871
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
language engine

872
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,799
and then

873
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,880
the uh the expression language engine

874
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
evaluates it and runs the command i gave

875
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
a demo of this yesterday and so you can

876
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,080
like you know run a runtime.exec and

877
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
launch a native process and take over

878
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,600
the server it's really just that easy

879
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,919
there is another possibility here by the

880
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,799
way

881
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,559
the data might come from a trusted

882
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
source like if an attacker gets some

883
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,919
data into your trusted database somehow

884
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,200
then that data can flow through a

885
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
different path and end up

886
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,520
getting in runtime.exec that way so

887
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,880
runtime protection

888
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,279
hardens the expression language engine

889
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
and without getting a huge amount of

890
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,679
detail because dave's going to cover

891
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,080
this later but on the front door you can

892
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,240
prevent untrusted data from going in to

893
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,919
the expression language injection the

894
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,840
expression language engine that stops a

895
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
whole bunch of attacks

896
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,399
and then for the trusted data that comes

897
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,640
in you can actually seal off the back

898
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
door and this is really a sandbox is

899
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,320
you're preventing dangerous things from

900
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,360
happening

901
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,039
from within an expression so you're

902
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,480
protecting the sort of the front door

903
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,919
and the back door the floor and the

904
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,480
ceiling or whatever

905
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
to make to take expression language

906
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,240
injection off the table and i

907
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
demonstrated this yesterday with an open

908
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
source tool called jot

909
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
it's really simple anybody could add it

910
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,039
to their application platform it doesn't

911
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,200
really add any performance hits it's

912
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
very fast and efficient and if

913
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,000
equifax had been using it they wouldn't

914
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,840
have gotten breached

915
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
it's really we can take whole classes of

916
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,440
vulnerabilities

917
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
off the table

918
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
using runtime protection and you know at

919
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,640
a minimum i don't think we should give

920
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,000
up on code hygiene but at a minimum we

921
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,919
should have this as a double check a

922
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,519
protection in place

923
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,559
to make sure we don't get exploited

924
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,320
okay

925
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,679
i'm doing on time here okay good

926
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
um

927
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
so

928
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,799
i think this is really interesting

929
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
i started talking about uh

930
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,679
nutrition facts labels for security at

931
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,559
oasp conference in 2004

932
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,640
and i made up a cool little uh you know

933
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
cereal box panel example that would say

934
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,080
hey here's some of the kinds of stuff we

935
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
could put on a label here's you know

936
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
here's how you built the software here's

937
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,120
how it was tested here's you know

938
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,440
libraries ingredients all that stuff

939
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,120
and

940
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,960
that idea

941
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
is finally coming to fruition it's

942
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
really kind of cool in the uh

943
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,960
the white house executive order that

944
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
came out i don't know or earlier in the

945
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,000
spring

946
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
uh

947
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
they talk about this they say hey we're

948
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,320
going to focus on visibility we're going

949
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,799
to look at creating a labels program

950
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,240
we're going to make people generate

951
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,399
s-bombs or software build materials

952
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,799
anybody hear that

953
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,159
yeah that idea seems to have a lot of

954
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,200
traction

955
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
it's really so just to be clear i think

956
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
it's like moving like you know three

957
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,559
percent of the way to where we need to

958
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,679
go but that's cool let's get it's like

959
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
kind of part of the argument is like you

960
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
should know what libraries are in stuff

961
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
so

962
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
uh in singapore

963
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,159
they've got a cool four level system

964
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,039
this is a label looks like this

965
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,519
uh it's got four stars

966
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,880
if you're really good

967
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,840
and uh it's got sort of four levels that

968
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,919
kind of go increasing levels of rigor

969
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,600
from like you know baseline stuff up to

970
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
pen testing at the top

971
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
and a nice range i don't know if that's

972
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,519
exactly the right range like i'd love to

973
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,360
see it more like hey you made a really

974
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,919
strong argument at the top of the list

975
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,080
but it's not bad

976
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,559
i believe in pen testing uh it's a it's

977
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,840
a good approach

978
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,559
so this scheme is is out there people

979
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,080
are using this and there's a bunch of

980
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
products that have been evaluated and it

981
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,519
just got adopted in finland like so now

982
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,039
they're partnering together on the same

983
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,159
scheme

984
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
the us is looking at this so they

985
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
mentioned in the cyber security order

986
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,039
the white house directed nist to go

987
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,559
uh implement

988
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,799
us you know a study that would look at

989
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,360
how we could do a labeling scheme

990
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,239
um

991
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,918
there's a zillion different labeling

992
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,520
schemes out there

993
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
uh

994
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,320
for different industries and i just want

995
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,079
you to think about this

996
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,159
all right let's do this who can name

997
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
like a label that's on a product that

998
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,239
you buy or you know

999
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,320
that gives you information about safety

1000
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,000
or security or something yeah

1001
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,639
legos have a warning on them yeah

1002
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,000
awesome

1003
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,599
don't don't eat them okay so that's a

1004
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,800
negative label right like don't eat this

1005
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,560
cool what else

1006
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,119
prop 65 warnings for california oh yeah

1007
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,800
is that like some uh chemical i don't

1008
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,879
know we don't have that in maryland uh

1009
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,359
okay cool

1010
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,320
ul is like a whole family of of labels

1011
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
right so yeah that's that's got a nice

1012
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,079
testing built-in program a third-party

1013
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,679
label yeah that's cool what else

1014
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,000
right

1015
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,160
all kinds of drugs right drug facts

1016
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,079
every package that you buy has a label

1017
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,839
on it what else has a label on it

1018
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,760
man what do you do

1019
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,119
that's the first thing you think of you

1020
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
don't think of like

1021
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,400
energy star or like harford

1022
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,200
okay yeah

1023
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,119
turns out there's labels for almost

1024
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,200
everything there's like mpa ratings on

1025
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,320
movies

1026
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
there's labels work

1027
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,640
they change markets

1028
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
and the reason they work is because they

1029
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
fix that asymmetric information problem

1030
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,880
right they share a little bit of

1031
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,119
information about what's in a product

1032
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,599
and they drive rational market behavior

1033
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
so i'm really in it it's everything uh

1034
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,880
there's i looked i did i studied all

1035
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
these different labeling schemes to try

1036
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,839
to figure out like well how should we do

1037
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,680
one for security and if you're

1038
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,520
interested i won't bore you with it here

1039
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
because it's super nerdy but like i

1040
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,839
looked at it and i gave a report to nist

1041
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,920
on uh like what kinds of things might

1042
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
work in security but i think we can do

1043
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,720
this

1044
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,560
i think this can work

1045
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
and os should be involved like somebody

1046
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,440
should fire up a labeling project and

1047
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,599
start experimenting with this stuff it

1048
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
works not only at the huge market scale

1049
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,079
it works

1050
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,359
inside your company too

1051
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
what just happened oh so it gets back to

1052
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
this

1053
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
it gets back to this idea i didn't

1054
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,200
mention this it gets back to this idea i

1055
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,520
have of security in sunshine

1056
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,760
when we do security and sunshine

1057
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
then everybody has the same information

1058
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,520
we make rational decisions and uh

1059
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,440
then actually like it's this is not a

1060
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,280
path to perfect security that's not

1061
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,599
something that i want what i want is the

1062
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,200
right level of security so there's no

1063
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,119
disconnects between the people using the

1064
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,040
product and the people that are

1065
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,720
producing the product

1066
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,480
i'm fine with stuff that's dangerous if

1067
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,640
as long as you tell me like then i'm

1068
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,160
making my own decisions then the market

1069
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
can decide what the right level of

1070
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,200
security is

1071
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,960
so

1072
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,880
let me wrap up uh with the right slide

1073
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,440
application security is in its infancy

1074
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
i've been doing this it feels like

1075
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,520
forever for so long but it's really just

1076
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,880
getting started and i i want you to

1077
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
compare this to like the automobile

1078
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,560
industry ralph nader was jumping up and

1079
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
down in the 1950s

1080
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,800
complaining about cars like the corvair

1081
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,320
and cars that you know pintos that

1082
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
explode on impact and things like that

1083
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,720
over the next

1084
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,920
50 60 years the automobile market

1085
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,000
changed dramatically now we've got

1086
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,320
mandatory seat belts and crumple zones

1087
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,280
and

1088
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,920
lidar and all kinds of cool safety stuff

1089
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,760
that make cars a lot safer than they

1090
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
were then that same transformation can

1091
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,200
happen

1092
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,720
in security

1093
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,200
it's really up to you

1094
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,480
the people in this room the people that

1095
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
care enough to come here

1096
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,160
are the people that can help make this

1097
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
come true and we can make it happen

1098
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
faster it can happen much much more

1099
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,839
slowly but there's a lot of things that

1100
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,079
are going on particularly related to the

1101
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,760
executive order that i think can

1102
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,800
actually make a difference

1103
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,359
but i have a vision of a future where

1104
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,320
when you use software you'll understand

1105
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
what the risks are you'll understand

1106
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,400
what the reasons are why you should

1107
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,760
trust it for what you're trying to use

1108
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,720
it for

1109
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,440
and that to me is if if we can get that

1110
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
done that would be a massive

1111
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,960
contribution to humanity so i'm i'm you

1112
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,400
know that's what i'm spending my the

1113
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,200
rest of my days doing um with that i'll

1114
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,240
stop

1115
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,200
please uh ask me anything we've got uh

1116
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,119
i guess uh at least another 10 minutes

1117
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,560
so i'd love to get some questions from

1118
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
y'all

1119
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,799
oh yeah great

1120
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
yeah

1121
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,269
[Music]

1122
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,549
[Music]

1123
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,530
um

1124
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,970
[Music]

1125
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,760
[Applause]

1126
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
yeah yeah i really think it's about so

1127
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,240
there's there's two pieces first is we

1128
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,920
want to get development teams focused on

1129
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,320
the work that matters the work that

1130
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
contributes to this argument that we're

1131
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,079
trying to make

1132
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,839
so that's the first thing is we got to

1133
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:46,880
you know make sure they're doing the

1134
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,119
right things because you know if

1135
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,560
developers are doing stuff that doesn't

1136
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,000
contribute to this argument like i think

1137
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,920
they would complain about busy work

1138
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,520
fixing vulnerabilities that don't matter

1139
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,119
chasing false positives all that kind of

1140
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,119
thing that's part of it

1141
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,119
but the second piece is what i would

1142
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,599
call shifting smart is let's do that

1143
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,400
work in the most efficient way possible

1144
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,119
and

1145
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,560
it's different for different projects

1146
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,079
different languages different platforms

1147
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
different environments

1148
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,520
but let's empower the developers to make

1149
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,920
that choice they are really good at

1150
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
building stuff

1151
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,079
they can automate this stuff way better

1152
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,240
than the security community can

1153
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,520
we are a

1154
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,200
you know a

1155
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,960
dance partner in this thing but we can

1156
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
leverage the infrastructure that's

1157
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
already oh geez i put up the wrong slide

1158
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,280
uh i wanted this slide

1159
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,240
uh

1160
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,359
up

1161
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,640
we can

1162
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
help them

1163
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,319
figure out the right place to do this

1164
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,040
the right way to do this uh and and make

1165
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
it the most efficient way to test this

1166
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,359
possible so that you know we can

1167
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,599
ultimately my vision is a pipeline

1168
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,520
that's strong enough that anytime you

1169
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,000
make a change

1170
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
the pipeline will verify security

1171
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
automatically that really has to be the

1172
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,280
goal

1173
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,359
because anything less means humans are

1174
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,000
in the loop and it just won't scale

1175
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
there's no possible way

1176
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,440
hfs

1177
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,240
hi

1178
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,440
thank you for the for the talk and

1179
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,319
i totally agree regarding to the whole

1180
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,480
concept of visibility

1181
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,119
and i want to say specifically for the

1182
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
security labels yeah and for the time

1183
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,720
being

1184
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,200
um do you think the osprey asvs is a you

1185
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,440
know it has four levels right yeah maybe

1186
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,839
that's a good starting point because i i

1187
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,200
start to see

1188
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,720
um some uh like pen test vendors

1189
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,640
they give you the report penalties

1190
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,400
report and it also say okay your

1191
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,000
asvs level i don't know three

1192
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,839
and uh i can imagine some client

1193
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,000
which will byproduct will still will

1194
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,319
start to ask so do you think that's a

1195
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,240
good starting point

1196
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,920
it might be a good starting point um

1197
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,839
i i wrote the first version of the asvs

1198
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,760
i'm really i think it's a good thing

1199
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
like what i wanted to do was kind of

1200
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,240
take the os top 10 down a level

1201
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,920
and focus on kind of the most important

1202
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,520
things in each category and i think

1203
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,880
they've made great improvements on that

1204
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,119
project since since i was involved

1205
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,520
i actually think the label should be

1206
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,599
you know like having a separate set of

1207
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,200
requirements that has nothing to do with

1208
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,680
the application is a little weird to me

1209
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,319
right it's like you know probably a

1210
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,079
bunch of the requirements in asvs don't

1211
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,920
apply to the thing that i'm happen to be

1212
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,000
building there's not it's not just web

1213
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,839
apps out there right there's software in

1214
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,160
blenders and dishwashers and airplanes

1215
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,400
and fighter jets and factories and i

1216
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,520
mean so like that set of things it's a

1217
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,200
good set of things but it doesn't apply

1218
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,720
everywhere so i would much rather see

1219
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,200
the label be tied to the argument like

1220
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,960
it should be a reflection of the whole

1221
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,359
argument just abstracted way up to a

1222
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,960
level that consumers can get their head

1223
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,599
around i think you know a really simple

1224
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,960
label is better

1225
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
actually

1226
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,560
something interesting about labels

1227
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,400
you're not trying to influence the

1228
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,520
buyers

1229
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,359
really and it seems like the label

1230
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,720
should be influencing buyers like you

1231
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,000
should read the ingredients and go like

1232
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,920
oh i don't want to eat arsenic in my

1233
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,440
cheerios but

1234
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,720
actually

1235
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,119
in almost all the different industries

1236
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
that use labels the first thing that

1237
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
gets affected is the producers because

1238
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,040
the lawyers won't let them produce

1239
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,079
product that is 100 arsenic

1240
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,520
and so once you start putting it on the

1241
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,400
box the lawyers get upset and it fixes

1242
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,480
the producing side of things

1243
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,720
later it took like 30 years for people

1244
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,040
to start reading

1245
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,160
food labels but the the vendors started

1246
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,598
improving their products right away

1247
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,880
i'm going to jump in on that so that's a

1248
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,000
it's a great point with uh with labels

1249
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,960
um

1250
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
i think it's the the producer side right

1251
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
if you look at like nitsa crash ratings

1252
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,280
yeah the majority of buyers don't look

1253
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
at them right like they sort of expect

1254
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,480
it but what's happened is no one

1255
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,079
produces a car that doesn't have a four

1256
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,480
star or five-star crash rating right

1257
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,720
because it works that way i i think

1258
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,960
there's another aspect of that that

1259
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,680
maybe you missed in your argument um

1260
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
and and i think it's worthwhile to point

1261
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,800
out in software right when we think of

1262
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
other things that we depend on and i was

1263
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,200
thinking that you stepped up the the the

1264
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,800
floor the little stage there was

1265
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,480
creaking right when you were walking a

1266
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,359
little bit um but we we do this in life

1267
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,160
every day like all of us in austin drove

1268
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,359
on bridges

1269
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,119
to get here

1270
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,560
and how many of us looked at the the

1271
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,880
composition scale the maintenance rating

1272
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,359
of the bridges there those ratings exist

1273
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,680
right the dot has them but we don't look

1274
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,520
at them yeah we still trust them enough

1275
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,480
to just drive on them blindly so blind

1276
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
trust isn't necessarily it's something

1277
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,640
we do all the time the challenge is how

1278
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,160
do we create the right incentives well

1279
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,920
it's not really blind if you know that

1280
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,599
there's inspectors out there that are

1281
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,839
looking at it right it's more like herd

1282
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
immunity here like you know yeah you

1283
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,240
take you're taking a free ride on the

1284
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
freeway you're taking a free ride on the

1285
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,480
work of all those other people but it's

1286
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,640
because it's visible in the market

1287
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,480
you don't have to actually read the

1288
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,560
label to know that it's not right i

1289
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,160
think there's an extension of that which

1290
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,359
is

1291
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,119
part of that is that infrastructure

1292
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,880
right there's inspectors that check it

1293
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,000
but also

1294
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
if you build whether you're a contractor

1295
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,599
or someone else you have a professional

1296
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,599
engineer right that's a licensed

1297
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,960
professional engineer if you build a

1298
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,880
faulty bridge yeah they can lose their

1299
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,560
license yeah so let me just put a pin in

1300
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,960
that because there's like license

1301
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
we could talk about this for two hours

1302
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,920
but like there are a lot of different

1303
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,160
rating labeling certification kinds of

1304
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,880
schemes there's self-assessment there's

1305
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,119
third parties that do it there's ul labs

1306
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,400
kind of

1307
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,640
situations there's the mpaa as like a

1308
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,319
private organization that doesn't talk

1309
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,280
very much

1310
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
honestly it doesn't really matter that

1311
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,160
much like what the rating system is i'm

1312
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,599
happy if they just come out with

1313
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,280
anything but

1314
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,640
i think the first step that we should

1315
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,000
make as an industry is self attestation

1316
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,160
it's it's so much easier than trying to

1317
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,599
establish an infrastructure for

1318
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,520
inspectors and certifications and

1319
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,440
standards all that stuff like let's just

1320
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
self-certify for a while i think it'll

1321
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,560
be very effective even if it's not 100

1322
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,560
accurate

1323
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,520
another question related to the labeling

1324
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,560
so

1325
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,560
people love labels

1326
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
well because he was going to spend the

1327
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,599
rest of probably well major part of your

1328
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,520
rest of career on this

1329
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,720
uh so you're more uh interested

1330
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,760
in the labeling for the consumer i mean

1331
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
multiple

1332
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,920
people

1333
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,839
who use the product

1334
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:54,839
or

1335
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,920
uh also include

1336
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
the you know we have a complex software

1337
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,119
supply chain right

1338
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,240
and then

1339
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,680
so i think the labeling may be different

1340
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,040
for the customer

1341
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,760
level thing but like a material safety

1342
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,760
data sheets like there's there's you

1343
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,599
know much more detailed information

1344
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,200
available for

1345
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,280
integrators and vendors like

1346
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,200
i think that's coming like s-bomb kind

1347
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,760
of has some of that stuff in it um

1348
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,400
for me it's like a a piece of the puzzle

1349
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,720
and i i worry that like we're gonna way

1350
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,400
over rotate on s-bombs and forget about

1351
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,960
you know all the other parts of a

1352
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,559
running application that can introduce

1353
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,240
risk because you know third-party

1354
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,680
libraries are just a little piece and in

1355
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,240
fact i mentioned this stat yesterday

1356
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,040
only seven percent of the open source

1357
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,119
code in an application

1358
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,359
ever runs

1359
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,359
typical application breaks down if you

1360
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,240
get 100 of the code 20 of it is custom

1361
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,119
code

1362
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,119
and the other 80 is open source but the

1363
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,240
problem is only six percent of that

1364
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,040
of uh that total application is open

1365
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,400
source code so

1366
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
that means seven and a half percent is

1367
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,559
actually what what uh

1368
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,160
of the open source code actually runs

1369
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,280
and so that means you know a lot of the

1370
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,640
findings out of these tools that look at

1371
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,480
your source code repo

1372
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
are wrong they're they're telling you

1373
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
you know both

1374
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,119
uh libraries that aren't actually in the

1375
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,480
running thing that's the you know the

1376
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
runtime reality piece

1377
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,559
and they're telling you uh and they're

1378
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,000
missing libraries that aren't in the

1379
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,119
runtime reality like uh you know

1380
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,559
platform libraries and app server

1381
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,319
libraries and

1382
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,720
a lot of times what they report

1383
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,640
is not exploitable because that code

1384
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,480
never runs so i consider those false

1385
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,680
positives

1386
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,880
and

1387
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,920
uh

1388
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,000
i think we need to to do some work on

1389
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,040
s-bombs and accuracy because uh you know

1390
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,480
they're often kind of misleading

1391
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,839
any more questions

1392
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,400
here we go

1393
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,480
romeo

1394
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,040
let me go start modeling

1395
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,480
jeff and i worked together way back in

1396
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,760
the 90s so

1397
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,720
um i guess the the one question and i

1398
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,319
agree with you talk about rasp you're

1399
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,839
talking about labeling i'm good with all

1400
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,000
those things i guess my question is if

1401
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,920
we're going to add labels

1402
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,119
and we're going to say that the

1403
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,119
traditional apsec things are not adding

1404
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,720
all the value what are we going to put

1405
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,319
on the label then right because you and

1406
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,400
i both grew up in the assurance

1407
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,960
building world of orange book and common

1408
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,640
criteria and all those things and we can

1409
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,240
talk about how terrible they all were

1410
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,319
but they did move some products forward

1411
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,359
in some

1412
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,720
way and improving security so what are

1413
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
we going to put on the label if we don't

1414
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,359
have threat modeling education sas all

1415
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,720
the things that are building blocks for

1416
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
insurance

1417
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,760
yeah so um

1418
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,000
first of all i would say that uh a lot

1419
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,720
of that work in the orange book days

1420
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
actually was wasted and like the windows

1421
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,599
nt

1422
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,920
sort of ct certification

1423
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,119
actually

1424
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,760
they microsoft hired a separate team

1425
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,160
to go build documentation never had any

1426
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,839
influence on the product they just built

1427
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,079
a ton of documentation submitted it got

1428
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,720
it certified and you know it was a

1429
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,440
security disaster but

1430
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,800
um

1431
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,880
my big point about this is not to

1432
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,960
completely throw away all the things

1433
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,480
that we've learned to do and know and

1434
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,359
love this rip mix and burn

1435
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,400
is really what i mean is like it's this

1436
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,440
stuff

1437
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,520
someone still has to you know verify

1438
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,680
that code works and you know someone has

1439
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,200
to think about

1440
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
threats and somebody has to come up with

1441
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,880
defense strategies and all those things

1442
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,160
have to happen

1443
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,760
but we need to

1444
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,480
you know that scene in uh apollo apollo

1445
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,319
13 apollo 11

1446
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,200
where they've got like all the

1447
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,720
scientists in the room and they come in

1448
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,079
and they dump all the parts and they're

1449
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,480
like we got to make this square this

1450
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,920
round thing fit in this square hole or

1451
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,319
the other way around whatever but like

1452
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,160
there's this this scramble where they

1453
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,079
you know have to reinvent

1454
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,160
the pieces to do a new job that's what

1455
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
we have to do here we've got the pieces

1456
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,680
i'm not saying we throw away all these

1457
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,880
things

1458
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
but we need to completely refactor how

1459
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
this works and my idea is to take

1460
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,280
one little piece of each of these things

1461
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,520
slice off a little bit

1462
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,680
and combine it into a new activity that

1463
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
we do in every sprint

1464
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,040
okay so it's not

1465
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,960
do all the threat modeling it's identify

1466
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,040
the next biggest threat

1467
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,960
it's easy you do it in a minute

1468
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,400
it's not build a whole security

1469
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,599
architecture

1470
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,680
it's come up with a defense for that new

1471
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,960
threat like how are we going to stop

1472
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,839
that

1473
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,760
we do that doesn't take long

1474
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,640
well it's the label is based on the

1475
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,760
argument

1476
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,079
that we build over time like i want you

1477
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,160
to imagine that you know we've done this

1478
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,440
for a year

1479
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,119
and we've got a pretty well developed

1480
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,440
threat model we've got great defenses in

1481
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,359
place we're testing them continuously so

1482
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,359
we know they're correct and effective

1483
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,760
and the label is a reflection of the

1484
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,480
argument anything else is just dumb if

1485
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,119
you put a label that says i ran sassed i

1486
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,880
don't give a i'm not riding on your

1487
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,559
roller coaster

1488
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,559
it's it's not good enough

1489
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,319
and so like the if you give me a label

1490
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,240
that says i did all of that stuff i

1491
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,680
don't care

1492
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,599
because it's not connected

1493
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,200
the threat model could be completely

1494
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,040
different from the security defenses and

1495
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,319
completely different from the tests we

1496
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,119
do

1497
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,960
that's crazy

1498
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,800
we need that we used to call it

1499
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,200
traceability in the orange book days in

1500
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,119
in the orange book

1501
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,800
there's you know it's much more formal

1502
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
much more waterfall but there's like

1503
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,760
a top level spec in a detailed spec and

1504
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
it flows all the way through to tests

1505
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,400
and you get a traceability from threat

1506
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,680
to test the full argument that just

1507
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,200
disappeared

1508
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,559
so now we're doing these things like we

1509
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,200
build a threat model but we're not

1510
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,880
writing requirements against the threat

1511
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,400
model it's just like a separate thing

1512
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,000
fun thing that the security guys went

1513
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,760
and did and we're not testing the

1514
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,200
requirements

1515
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,880
we're testing whatever the hell the pen

1516
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,400
tester wants to test when they walk in

1517
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,760
the door

1518
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,440
and i don't know we got some you know

1519
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,000
some really smart kid who's never done

1520
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,160
it before and he's really good at xss so

1521
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
he spends his time doing that and we get

1522
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,559
an a plus on xss and an f for everything

1523
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,119
else and like i want to

1524
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,200
reestablish traceability that's the

1525
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,960
point of the argument threat modeling is

1526
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,400
the core of this

1527
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,319
then there's defense strategy then

1528
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,680
there's evidence around the edge and

1529
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,040
then the label

1530
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,559
should reflect that

1531
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,839
should say hey you're doing all this

1532
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,280
stuff right

1533
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,240
so you get four stars if you've got a

1534
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,800
crappy argument then you should get a d

1535
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,880
or an f or something i don't care what

1536
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,400
the labeling scheme is it doesn't matter

1537
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
that much but it's really

1538
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
getting people to think this through and

1539
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,240
do the process that that's what matters

1540
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
why wouldn't we merge user acceptance

1541
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,559
testing with stress testing with

1542
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,079
security testing so you get the

1543
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,680
profitability of the custom to the

1544
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,520
company you get ease of use to the

1545
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,839
customer you get trust by the world so

1546
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:22,400
ugw are a nice little acronym pet

1547
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,680
so uh

1548
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,520
my i mean i think it probably makes

1549
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,920
sense but what i would say is i don't

1550
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,319
care how you make cakes

1551
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,599
and

1552
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,359
i use this cake example sometimes

1553
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,480
because

1554
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,880
i've worked with hundreds of enterprises

1555
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,599
on their appsec programs and

1556
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,440
they're all different every software

1557
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,200
company is different

1558
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,440
and the cake analogy is like imagine

1559
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,920
like you know a small mom-and-pop

1560
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,640
wedding cake shop they do stuff with you

1561
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,040
know hand tools and they make great

1562
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,440
cakes that's a perfectly fine business

1563
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,200
then there's a tasty cake factory on the

1564
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,960
other end that's like completely

1565
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,280
automated chemicals pouring in vats and

1566
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
you know like assembly lines and

1567
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,040
automated tools that's a completely

1568
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,480
different thing

1569
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,559
i don't want to tell you

1570
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
how to do your

1571
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,520
cake making

1572
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,359
that's not our job

1573
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,280
our job is to focus on this and make

1574
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,079
sure that somewhere in that factory and

1575
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,760
we have to work together with the people

1576
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,240
that own the machinery in that factory

1577
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,520
somewhere

1578
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,160
we've put in the the processes and the

1579
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,079
people and the technology

1580
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,960
to build the argument to answer the

1581
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,839
question because if we don't answer the

1582
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,680
question then what are we doing what's

1583
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,720
the point of of any of this

1584
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,319
so that that's how i would answer is

1585
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,160
like i'm not here to tell you that you

1586
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,480
have to merge those things you can do

1587
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,319
them separate if that's how you build

1588
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:49,359
software

1589
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,440
if you want to merge them together great

1590
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,799
do that

1591
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,920
but

1592
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,200
you know we shouldn't be in the business

1593
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,880
of telling people how to build software

1594
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
it doesn't work it just pisses off the

1595
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,280
people that we need

1596
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,559
to uh to help us

1597
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,200
thank you jeff

1598
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,340
great keynote thanks everybody

1599
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,050
[Applause]

1600
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,039
you
