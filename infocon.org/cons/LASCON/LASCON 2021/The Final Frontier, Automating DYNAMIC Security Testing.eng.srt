1
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,240
well hello welcome to the lunchtime talk

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
so thank you for skipping some food or

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
eating early i appreciate that this is

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
the final frontier automating dynamic

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,640
security testing with myself and let's

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
go to the next slide cody

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,360
um quickly about me

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
i'm a defect dojo core contributor i

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
also i'm a co-lead of the apsec pipeline

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
i've been involved in obasa for far too

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
long since 2008 that's not really far

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
too long i've liked the place

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
um i'm currently the global director of

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
security evangelism for no name security

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
so if you have api security needs come

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,719
talk to me

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,719
and i'm also a founder of ten security

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
and then we have cody uh hi i'm cody

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,000
mafucci

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
currently i'm a senior software security

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,960
engineer at um tipco software um a big

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,480
contributor a defect dojo been around

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,159
the project for a little bit

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,600
and then i'm also working with mata 10

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
security as a project architect

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,240
awesome

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
so i did not know this when we did this

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
cfp

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,680
that the final frontier was going to be

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
broken by william shatner going up to

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,759
space so the connection with our talk

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,000
title is completely accidental

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
um i bet i was hilarious i was doing the

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
deck was like son of a gun

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
kirk's going to space messing things up

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
so what's today's talk going to be i'm

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
going to do a quick intro about das

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,240
automation and just kind of cover that

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,759
in general the level set things we're

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,840
going to talk about targeting in desk

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
and then we're going to bring it all

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
together with a live demo because we

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,000
don't like ourselves and we like moving

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
us

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,799
so today we're going to be talking all

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,040
about the intro name to dynamic testing

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
um primarily just how to do it correctly

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,200
what to watch out for um and things that

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,079
can potentially bite you

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,159
so what is death it's primarily just

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,799
dynamic application security testing

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,399
there's really two main schools of

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,680
thought there's static testing and

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,520
dynamic testing the static you can think

55
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
of is just looking at the source code

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
and trying to find anything wrong that

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
you can potentially exploit whereas

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
dynamic testing is when the app is

59
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,879
actually running and processed and

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,160
you're doing all sorts of things that

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
could potentially take advantage of

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
browser vulnerabilities or just anything

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
like that

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
we're going to skip pretty much

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
everything else

66
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
just to really focus on desk and the

67
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,160
importance of it

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,080
so why is it hard to automate fast why

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
do i even have this talk

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,720
um

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
most companies obviously don't want to

72
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
test improv period right so you're stuck

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
with the uat or pre-prod or staging

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,319
whatever you call you're not prod thing

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
um and if you're lucky that matches prod

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
in a lot of cases there's some nuances

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,360
to be nice between prod and not fraud so

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
that's a problematic thing and then

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
you're unsure about the controls right

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,959
do the controls you have in prod match

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
the controls you have and not prod

82
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
probably not that expensive waff is

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,120
probably only protecting crowd and

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
probably isn't protecting not fraud so

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,879
you have these interesting problems and

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,879
then you also have the data does the

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,680
data in prod match what's in not prod

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
right are you copying back which is not

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
exactly best practice how are you

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
managing that there are all these kind

91
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
of wrinkles around it

92
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
um companies are it's getting much

93
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,159
better than it used to be i remember

94
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
when like configuration management was

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,280
this weird spooky thing it's no longer

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
weird and spooky so there are companies

97
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
are beginning to embrace configuration

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
management salt puppet ship hall helm

99
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,280
ansible all those good things

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
um and if you have containers you're

101
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
doing yourself a favor that's much

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,519
easier

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,200
plus one if you have any kind of elastic

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
infrastructure where you can spin up and

105
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,239
down things without going through a

106
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,319
change control board or some kind of

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,760
silliness

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
you might know how i feel about change

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
control boards after that statement

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,080
um

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,480
and then devops in apsec teams sometimes

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
they play nice together sometimes they

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,519
don't that can kind of make things

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,560
interesting if there isn't a good

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
working relationship there particularly

116
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
if you want to do automated dash

117
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,439
with a dynamic dynamically spun up

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,120
environment if you're not friends with

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
the devops peeps you're probably not

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
going to have that happening or it's

121
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
going to be some full political

122
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,959
wrangling to make that happen

123
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
and then the other final thing that i'm

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
kind of calling credential management

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
for lack of a better term is

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,399
okay you're not going to test in prod

127
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,478
you're going to test in pre-prod

128
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,959
can you dynamically allocate credentials

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,040
for pre-prod that are configured in a

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
way that you need to do accurate testing

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
dynamically and in almost all cases the

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
answer is no and that will be a

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
shortfall that you'll have to work

134
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
around right can i grab a user in

135
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
staging that has a checking account

136
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
because i want to test out the bill pay

137
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
portion of my banking app right well if

138
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,840
you don't have the ability to spin up

139
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
one of those users quickly you may be

140
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,280
kind of running against the wind which

141
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,000
is not a great thing so that's a wrinkle

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
you will probably run into

143
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
so there's all sorts of different levels

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
and levels of rigor that you can add to

145
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
all sorts of your your kind of school's

146
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
thought of actually doing the dynamic

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,160
test itself um there's two two very big

148
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
tracks whether you do an authenticated

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,000
scan or an authentic scan so right off

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
the bat you know the difference is is

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,639
how much the application are you really

152
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
going to be looking at um so for example

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,680
on that side you're going to be looking

154
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
at like your login page any kind of like

155
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,840
faqs or maybe some signup forms some

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
very basic stuff

157
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
but with the authentication scan um it's

158
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
a lot harder to actually get into you

159
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
know actually configuring the scans to

160
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,320
have the correct credentials and finding

161
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
the right submit buttons and all that

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
it's it's a headache at best

163
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
but it does allow you to actually get a

164
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,160
lot more

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
confidence and what you're actually

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,240
finding on your web page

167
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
the difference between full crawls and

168
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,039
targeted crawls

169
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
kind of goes back to how much of the

170
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
application do you actually want to be

171
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,759
scanning so a full crawl obviously is

172
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
going to take a lot of extra time and a

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,479
lot more resources to actually get

174
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
through but you're going to be able to

175
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,360
know for certain like okay i know where

176
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
these this is these are the hot spots

177
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
and this is where i'm really safe

178
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,840
so are there anything that you know you

179
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,960
want to kind of have the best of both

180
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
worlds so you could have like a full

181
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
crawl but you could also take off you

182
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,680
know say any non-important things such

183
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
as like you know logo forms anything

184
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,720
that's not really all that important

185
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
like feedbacks um anything of that

186
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
nature really

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
but for the more complicated things you

188
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,039
know take for example

189
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
maybe half the page only displays once

190
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,720
you meet a certain criteria of whatever

191
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
input is accepted um how can you handle

192
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,479
those things um there's any additional

193
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
tools that you could be using on top of

194
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,560
something like rip suite to crawl um you

195
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,759
could do the automation through like

196
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
selenium browsing to just kind of

197
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,039
programmatically walk through your web

198
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,560
page for you entering all sorts of

199
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
different keys and strings and open up

200
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
those hidden areas that are just well

201
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,759
hidden

202
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
yeah it hands up who has accidentally or

203
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,199
not thinkingly crawled the website with

204
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
the feedback form and submitted 500 plus

205
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,479
um feedback forms from peter weiner back

206
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
before burp suite changed the name from

207
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
peter weiner to something mildly more

208
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
appropriate

209
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
certainly i've never done that i'm much

210
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
more careful but i've heard of some

211
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,599
people who have

212
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
so let's talk about some sort of

213
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
more on the rigor and considerations to

214
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,759
take so

215
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,240
yes obviously unoff is way easier um

216
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
it's obviously going to be less thorough

217
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
which has the upside of being quicker

218
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
but and and politically speaking it's

219
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
much easier to sell right an on off scan

220
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
is something i could do from a coffee

221
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
shop to any website so you're really not

222
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
adding any like more scariness to what

223
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,039
you have just in the fact that you have

224
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
the thing sitting on the internet right

225
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,080
so that should be politically pretty

226
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
easy to sell

227
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
off is obviously much more difficult to

228
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
do right you need kind of salad solid

229
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
password management and credential

230
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
management user management if you want

231
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
to do it in an automated fashion it's

232
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
obviously way more thorough so it's

233
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
significantly better in that regard

234
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,039
although

235
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,840
you're

236
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
adding time to the crawls

237
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
and it's harder to sell particularly in

238
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
prod in in pre-prod or if you can clone

239
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,960
prod that's a much better story um but

240
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
it is harder to sell politically and

241
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
then looking at full crawl versus

242
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
targeted crawl

243
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
um most tools know how to do a full

244
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,919
crawl right you point them out a url you

245
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,319
get some president goes on its merry way

246
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,840
um you're gonna have to watch out for

247
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
crawl loops i've seen crawlers before

248
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,120
depending on how your site is developed

249
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
just you know endlessly go through the

250
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
catalog and never leave right it's kind

251
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
of a problematic thing

252
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
um the rigor is as good as the crawl

253
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,879
right and if you have a selenium or some

254
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,560
kind of qa testing that's rigorous

255
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
that's a great thing to leverage to get

256
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
a well-known full crawl so to speak

257
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
um and then you have to worry about the

258
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
crawl time right on a full crawl like is

259
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
it is your site really huge how much of

260
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
your 40 000 products do you really need

261
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
to crawl do you only like crawl a subset

262
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
of them those are kind of interesting

263
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,479
wrinkles when you get into really big

264
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
sites

265
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,599
and then the target crawl it's obviously

266
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,519
much more difficult to set up

267
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,440
a lot of the crawlers aren't that smart

268
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,719
and particularly in the commercial

269
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
automated tools they're kind of dumb

270
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,679
they just like your own they just like

271
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
to go i've seen some of them now support

272
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,959
selenium and other things which is kind

273
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
of nice but that's always kind of a

274
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
wrinkle

275
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,800
the

276
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
rigor obviously is only that that target

277
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
of your crawl that limited target but

278
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
it's also nicer because if that's the

279
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
spookiest part of your app and your time

280
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
window is such that you can't do the

281
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
full app

282
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
that may actually be a valid choice

283
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,399
and it's usually easier to solve because

284
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
you're kind of usually focusing on the

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,440
riskiest bits

286
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,519
of the app

287
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,440
so matt and i like to think of

288
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,120
well this approach is kind of like a

289
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
moon system you have your three phases

290
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
of the moon you start out with nothing

291
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
and then you get the crescent and wax

292
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
and all of a sudden you're at a full

293
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
moon that's like your peak security you

294
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
are the werewolf essentially

295
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
so when you're starting out you're doing

296
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
everything by hand you know you're just

297
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,399
figuring out the tool you're doing

298
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
pretty much just the poc just raw and

299
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,880
just going at it day after day

300
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
and then once you start to kind of get

301
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,519
it figured out and get it working out as

302
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,880
bare bones configuration you start

303
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,480
thinking okay well how can i make this

304
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,600
easier

305
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
and then you're still kind of in a

306
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,399
hands-on approach but you're starting to

307
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
get towards a little bit towards like a

308
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
halfway automated kind of way

309
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
it's a lot of ways

310
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
so it's really just understanding the

311
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,279
configuration parameters and how what

312
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,279
urls work which don't which profiles

313
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,080
work

314
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
blah blah blah

315
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,480
and then finally when you get to the

316
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
full moon that's when you're just

317
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
passing it off and you're like hey this

318
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
works put it into your workflows and

319
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,040
magic you know voila you've made it and

320
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
that's when everything is just running

321
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,279
automatically and you just feel good as

322
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
a security engineer

323
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
so the first phase the crescent phase so

324
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
to speak to use our moon analogy right

325
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
the idea here is you're really doing a

326
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,959
poc i want to make sure that the tool

327
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,320
that i'm going to pick to automate will

328
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
one work and just be functional and it

329
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
produce reasonable results right there's

330
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,839
no reason to automate things that's

331
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
going to give you 90 false positives

332
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,279
like leave that thing on the floor and

333
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
move on and find a better tool

334
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,560
so this is really the idea that the

335
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
crescent moon phase is understanding do

336
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,120
i get a lot of false positives or not is

337
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
it worth actually going forward with

338
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
this tool i'd call it a poc right if you

339
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,519
pass this stage then you go on to the

340
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,760
second stage the waxing moon stage yeah

341
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,519
that's just essentially like you know is

342
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
this reproducible is it consistent am i

343
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,120
getting the same results over and over

344
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
um you know what what tweaks and

345
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
specific areas change in these regards

346
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
you know are those changes really

347
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
important so what what the organization

348
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
is trying to focus on

349
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,040
really things like that

350
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,040
it's just doing the very very tedious

351
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
repetitions of understanding the tool

352
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,240
how it speaks how it actually presents

353
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
things to you and is is half of it even

354
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
usable and what do you do with the other

355
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
half that isn't

356
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
yeah this is a period of time where it's

357
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,519
really

358
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,360
useful to spend time tweaking

359
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,640
particularly in commercial standards

360
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
that have like a scan profile this is

361
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
where you spend time really tweaking

362
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,079
that turning off signatures turning on

363
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,440
signatures whatever you need to do to

364
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
make it as effective as possible now

365
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
that you've proved that it'll actually

366
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
work

367
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,279
and then full moon right this is where

368
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,800
you've got a profile that you can live

369
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,560
with you understand the scanner it's as

370
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
tuned as you can get it you're ready to

371
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,839
launch right

372
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,360
um

373
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,800
if you're using commercial tools most of

374
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
those and some open source as well i

375
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
believe have scheduling options right

376
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,839
you can schedule this to run weekly

377
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:42,800
daily

378
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,959
at you know 2 pm on saturday whatever

379
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,560
works for you

380
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
considerations on the cadence when you

381
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
are doing automated scanning you want to

382
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
do it kind of clock based every week

383
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
every day

384
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,680
every month every quarter whatever makes

385
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,079
sense for your case or do you want to do

386
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,000
it on like a development based you know

387
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
every release every major release every

388
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,279
commit

389
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,880
right how quickly do you want to do this

390
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
and how often do you want to do this a

391
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,760
lot of that will depend on how quickly

392
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
you can get something from say a commit

393
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
to a testable thing as well if you don't

394
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
have good cicd you may not have that

395
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,040
option

396
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,920
and then as you um as new versions of

397
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
the tools come out particularly in the

398
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
commercial space

399
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,839
then there are going to be new rules and

400
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
signatures and new things you can tweak

401
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
right so you do have to there's some

402
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
care and feeding to this over time to

403
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
make sure that your automation doesn't

404
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,319
drift away into like a noisy mess

405
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,880
so one in my opinion one of the most

406
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
important parts of actually taking what

407
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,880
you've made in this full moon cycle is

408
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,639
really attaching it to

409
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
well what what do you want to attach it

410
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,680
to you really need to drill down and

411
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
figure out what the scope is you know

412
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,079
you don't want to just throw this

413
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,760
everywhere and hope it sticks and half

414
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
of the places you throw you want to be

415
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,480
very deliberate with where you're

416
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
deploying this this this automated

417
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
feature um so really it's considering

418
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
you know things do i want to do this on

419
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
prod do i want to do this on like a mini

420
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
prod or maybe a clone of one or just

421
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
just doing it on on a done development

422
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
server good enough

423
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
so those are all the things that you

424
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,720
really need to consider before you just

425
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
start throwing it everywhere and just

426
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
burning that precious time

427
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
so prop versus not prod i kind of talked

428
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
about this earlier

429
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
obviously like i said most businesses

430
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
are super hesitant about poking that

431
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,639
product right oh my god it'll go down

432
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,839
we'll lose all the money and it'll be

433
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,240
awful flames and scariness

434
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,600
um so

435
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
you have to ask yourself how closely

436
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
does the environment you you need to or

437
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,040
you're able to test against i should say

438
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,959
match that that

439
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,320
production environment right are you

440
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,079
confident that what you're testing is

441
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,680
going to give you adequate results and

442
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
mirror what should be or what is in prod

443
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
and this is where the testing scope is

444
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,639
important right you have to understand

445
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
what have i decided to test like

446
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
particularly the first time through with

447
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
your automation

448
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
getting an understanding and really

449
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
having a good concrete idea of what that

450
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
scope is is vitally important like

451
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,639
understand what your goal is of this

452
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,800
automation is it only to test the cart

453
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
does it test the entire site is it only

454
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
to do on auth to see what my public

455
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
exposure is right determine that at

456
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,160
first and it'll drive a lot of these

457
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
other decisions

458
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
if you do have a dynamic infrastructure

459
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,199
and you're doing configuration

460
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,040
management correctly

461
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
talk to the devops team and see if they

462
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,639
can throw up a mini pod for you right

463
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,920
maybe your prod looks like multiple load

464
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
balancers with a large number of

465
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
horizontal nodes behind those load

466
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
balancers and maybe some services

467
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
underneath those well can i do a single

468
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,680
load balancer with maybe two

469
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
of the app nodes and a single cache

470
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
right whatever is in your like can i do

471
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
a mini version of prod can you fire that

472
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,959
up for me

473
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
and say one of our cloud accounts and

474
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,959
let me have free reign to poke at that

475
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,160
right because now i can even do

476
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
destructive testing because it's prod

477
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
but it's not prod right it's a mini

478
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,079
clone of prod if you can get that you're

479
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
really doing good

480
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,160
um some of this is political and you may

481
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,519
not want to die on the hill of prague

482
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
you may just have to concede that right

483
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
and you may not have the devops chops to

484
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
throw up a mini product that's okay like

485
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
at some point you have to sort of make

486
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
the best of what the political world

487
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,240
gives you in your job

488
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
um

489
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
if you do have solid logging and

490
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,279
observation

491
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,959
observability

492
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,440
yes i can't speak today observability

493
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
this is a great way to get evidence of

494
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,720
the safety or

495
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
could be the lack of it in your testing

496
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
of prop right if you have a mini prod

497
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,480
that has the same kind of logging turned

498
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,959
on for this mini prod you can run a test

499
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,639
and show look i ran against minnie broad

500
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
and nobody died and this may be an

501
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,560
argument to get you to fraud later in

502
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
the future

503
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,600
um

504
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
i found this out in my history of doing

505
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,759
absec not prod is usually a very

506
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,519
neglected redheaded stepchild of the

507
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
environments it gets very little love so

508
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,360
you will probably gonna have to deal

509
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,600
with inaccuracies between what is prod

510
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,680
and what you're actually testing

511
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,360
and then understand with the scope in

512
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,839
particular what you're trying to test

513
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
are you testing if you're a micro

514
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
service app are you testing the one

515
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
micro service are you testing that micro

516
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
service in with all the other micro

517
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
services like what's the scope right and

518
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,160
then the scope will tell you that and

519
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
that'll let you know maybe if it is just

520
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,759
a single micro service is the scope of

521
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
your test that's really easy to throw up

522
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,279
as a mini product i literally just have

523
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,360
to maybe launch a container

524
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,040
and then poke at it right so that may be

525
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
an easy win

526
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
just another consideration

527
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
yeah really what really echoing on the

528
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
whole non-prod prod argument it's really

529
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,480
important to consider how how these

530
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
non-prod and prod environments are

531
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
really set up you know so we i like to

532
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,240
think of this as static and dynamic um

533
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,079
so a static environment for prod

534
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
non-prod is well is example of the red

535
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,600
headed step child you just have your

536
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
non-pro just sitting there it's got very

537
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,279
minimal data it's really not that useful

538
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,759
besides you can just hit it in a browser

539
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,040
but then your product environment's got

540
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,399
all sorts of moving parts you know

541
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
people are still using it all the time

542
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,399
you know which which one are you going

543
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,839
to prefer when you're doing your testing

544
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,120
obviously the one that has a bigger use

545
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,399
case and can do some really more

546
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,480
tangible reporting

547
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
so it really just depends on where your

548
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,720
organization is on their whole we call

549
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
it the um what's their term the

550
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,240
automation journey

551
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
so we're big fans of of automating

552
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,079
configurations through what we call

553
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,520
configuration management using something

554
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,079
like ansible puppet salt uh anything

555
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,359
like that to where if you could just

556
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
spin up something that's as close to the

557
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
production server as possible the better

558
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
that's kind of our ideal situation to

559
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,400
where you know it's kind of like a copy

560
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
paste that's perfect

561
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,079
but you know at a lot of work you don't

562
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
really find that very often you just

563
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
find well you have a prod and you have a

564
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
not prod not prod is just hanging out

565
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,480
so the quality of your results really

566
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,760
depends on

567
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
what kind of groundwork you've put in

568
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,160
place for provisioning these new servers

569
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
against the prod and the non-prod

570
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,520
and then losing control a little bit of

571
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,240
a

572
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
click-baity slide title it's not really

573
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,919
about losing control but you have to

574
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,200
determine what you want to do about

575
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
those intermediate controls that aren't

576
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
necessarily in the app right you're

577
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
testing an app let's say that's your

578
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
scope well if you have a waf and an ips

579
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,679
and a bunch of other intermediary

580
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
devices between public internet and that

581
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,160
app is that in scope or not

582
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
right are you wanting to test the app in

583
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,360
isolation meaning i want to test the app

584
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
with no external controls

585
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
or and i want to understand how the app

586
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
would perform by itself because maybe

587
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,640
the controls fail open and the app is

588
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
now on the internet without the waft do

589
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,520
i want to understand what that looks

590
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,679
like that may be like a consideration

591
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,039
for your scope

592
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
and it would give you the

593
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,400
value or the ability to evaluate what

594
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
that app can do kind of in and of itself

595
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,480
like how sturdy is it without these

596
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
external controls or others are those

597
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
external controls like fundamental in

598
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,960
keeping that app alive on the internet

599
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
or you could test the app in what i

600
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,559
would call its native environment right

601
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,320
i want to test it with all the normal

602
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,559
inline controls that i have wafts and

603
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
whatnot to understand how effective

604
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
those are as providing extra belt and

605
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
suspender protection to my app right

606
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,200
that may be your scope as well

607
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
it's kind of nice because

608
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
you get to understand the security

609
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
posture of the app

610
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,559
in production presuming this is a big

611
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,400
presuming and a big if

612
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
the non-prod thing that you're probably

613
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,559
testing has the same controls as prod

614
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,360
that's a big if so watch out for that

615
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
um and you do get to at least evaluate

616
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
the effectiveness of those controls

617
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,360
right if this particularly if you do the

618
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,799
hybrid option which is the last option

619
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,679
where you do both if i can get a sequel

620
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,000
injection without the watch in place but

621
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
i don't get it with the laugh in place

622
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,880
well the laugh is actually providing

623
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
some value that's kind of cool i just

624
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
figured that out now i have to do two

625
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,240
scans to do that it's kind of painful um

626
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
there's a lot of setup there but it is

627
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,120
kind of nice to get that full picture

628
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,480
and that's one of those decisions you're

629
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,240
going to have to decide do i want or not

630
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
want to evaluate those controls as part

631
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
of my system

632
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
yeah just add on to that there's another

633
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,720
level of scope uh surprise

634
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
you know different audiences want

635
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,919
different things um so if you're wanting

636
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,280
to work with developers you may not want

637
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
to just give them an entire report

638
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,240
encompassing the entire application

639
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
because you know for for most

640
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
organizations you've got like an api

641
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
team a web dev team maybe a mobile app

642
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,799
team

643
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,320
mobile app team does not care anything

644
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
about the other two um so in some cases

645
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
you might want to have your your testing

646
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,159
split off and do everything kind of

647
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,600
individually so you can give the reports

648
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,559
to the people that can actually do the

649
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,799
triaging but in the case of auditors

650
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,159
they want to see the big picture you

651
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,600
know just give them one piece of the

652
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
puzzle they're going to be like well

653
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,240
what do you want me to do with this you

654
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
know do you want to pass or not um

655
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,360
so it's

656
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,640
you know it's kind of where do you want

657
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
to put your eggs you know who's do you

658
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
want to put all the work on the security

659
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
team to put all these testing in place

660
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,559
or do you want to just pass the dev team

661
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
one massive report and have them kind of

662
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,520
come through and figure out their their

663
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,240
own piece of the mission um so that's

664
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,679
another big thing to consider when

665
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,320
you're setting up this automation

666
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
and then if you haven't figured out by

667
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,679
now i like configuration management

668
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
right this is where if you don't have it

669
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,799
or if you don't know if you have it go

670
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
find out like as quickly as possible

671
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
because that's really going to radically

672
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
change or gosh if you're interviewing

673
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,480
for a new job ask that question before

674
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,440
you get there because it'll tell you

675
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,640
what kind of environment you're dropping

676
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
into kind of a good thing to know like

677
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
is my uh

678
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
testing and automating my testing going

679
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,080
to be more or less interesting meaning

680
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
painful um but find that out that's

681
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,280
really really important because if you

682
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
have that and you can make friends with

683
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,799
the people that control that part of the

684
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
business you can really get way more

685
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
mileage for your time which is a big big

686
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
thing spinning up those consistent

687
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
environments is huge

688
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,120
um one of the nice things we did this a

689
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,559
lot at rackspace and one of the cool

690
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,679
things that came out of that is we

691
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,200
actually had what we call blessed

692
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
versions so our ansible was checked into

693
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,520
i think we had an internal github

694
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,039
whatever the repository was it was

695
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,400
checked into the repository we would

696
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
give it a tag

697
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,400
and tell the ops teams you can do one

698
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,039
seven five hundred i don't care releases

699
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,880
out the prod of this tagged version

700
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,159
because we've looked at it and it's

701
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,120
hardened and it's going to be

702
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
consistently deployed

703
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,799
knock yourself out guys we don't care

704
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,240
right so that's another advantage you

705
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
can get with this

706
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,679
configuration management doing things

707
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,120
right and if you do have your

708
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
configuration management parameterized

709
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
that's how you can take the same

710
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,760
in essence configuration management

711
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
setup that does a big prod and make a

712
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
little project by changing some

713
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,240
parameters and off you go

714
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
yeah kind of a different branch of the

715
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,400
configuration um you know everybody

716
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
loves docker containers i'm biggest fan

717
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
of docker ever i love it um use it every

718
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,760
single day actually

719
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,840
but the the big thing is is that you can

720
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,120
pretty much create a container and just

721
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,559
pass it off to anybody and they can just

722
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,240
run it locally and it ideally shouldn't

723
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,679
be changeable you know they don't have

724
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
to go talk to it get some service

725
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
provision run the whole config

726
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
management get everything loaded wait

727
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,520
you know two to three business days

728
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,679
we all know how the kind is with docker

729
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,280
containers it's it's instantaneous for

730
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
the most part you know you pull down the

731
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,159
image you know i can do it the devs can

732
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
do it even the sizzo can do it everybody

733
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
can do it and it's really fantastic um

734
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,440
but the best part is is that it's

735
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
scalable as well you know if docker is

736
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
kind of a little base level

737
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
when you're getting into it but then you

738
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
can kind of graduate onto the k-8s and

739
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,159
then you could do all sorts of nutty

740
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,840
things with k-8s

741
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,600
so you could be having all this

742
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,840
automation on either locally or in the

743
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
web in the cloud wherever you fancy for

744
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
the most part

745
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
yeah go containers

746
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,080
and if you do get to the point where

747
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
you're very mature with containers one

748
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,080
of the nice things you can do as well is

749
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
let's say you set up that these four

750
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,440
tests are going to be automated and

751
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,919
happen anytime you go to pre-prod

752
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,840
you can give those same containers with

753
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
the same configurations to the devs and

754
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
say hey before you push the

755
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
repo why don't you run this locally

756
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
right all they need is docker on their

757
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
box and they're off to the races that's

758
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,559
a great way to say hey i can give you a

759
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,080
chance to pre-check that you're going to

760
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,760
pass the call that you're gonna get when

761
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
you try to you know commit remaster or

762
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
whatever your trigger is to run those

763
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,880
tests

764
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,799
yes who doesn't love delegation right

765
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
yeah um so bring it all together you

766
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,080
know we've talked about a whole lot of

767
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,600
different things and ways that you can

768
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,120
really go about it um so we've made a

769
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
little demo for you

770
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
um

771
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,679
yeah so uh

772
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,000
i didn't want to we both have italian

773
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
backgrounds although we don't speak it

774
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
and

775
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
i'm well i'm far removed from italy

776
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
anyway but there's my grandfather's

777
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
father came from italy so it's kind of

778
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,039
close

779
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,400
um anyway i thought i'd put a little bit

780
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,840
of a tie in here since we both have

781
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
italian backgrounds so the idea here is

782
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,159
here's the background here's a setup you

783
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,520
work at a company you want to start

784
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,600
doing dash automation you've decided to

785
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
start with on all scans it's easy it's

786
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
politically sellable

787
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
you decide to containerize your tools

788
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
and the targets because you like

789
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,720
containers or you're be doing the demo

790
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,039
and that's just what makes sense to you

791
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
um actually cody did the demo so props

792
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,840
to him um you run dynamic

793
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,559
parallel deploys of the application in

794
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,000
testing so i have the ability to spin up

795
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
these mini prods in essence we're going

796
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
to pick two tools just to make life easy

797
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,840
for our first iteration so we're going

798
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,320
to do tls testing as well as a dash

799
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
scanner and then all the scans are going

800
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
to go into our vulnerability repository

801
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
which is there any choice it's defect

802
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,400
dojo come on be read i may or may not

803
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
happen to be a core contributor

804
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
but yeah it's a great great project

805
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
so now it's time to uh

806
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,720
do something or get off the proverbial

807
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
pot i ran into this image of an

808
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,679
astronaut

809
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,760
on a toilet and i couldn't not include

810
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
it in my astro themed deck so sorry that

811
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,080
is the maybe that's the new file

812
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
frontier

813
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,559
i think that might be william shatner

814
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:00,890
actually

815
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,559
[Laughter]

816
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,120
no comment okay let's go to the demo

817
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,919
yeah before i get myself in trouble uh

818
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,720
here we go so

819
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,919
so when that's pulling that up um give

820
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,559
me kind of a high level uh i guess look

821
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,320
through the glass and what this demo is

822
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,200
um

823
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
it's pretty it's pretty quick actually

824
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,799
um so it's all just based on docker

825
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,640
compose which is just kind of a way to

826
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,840
organize a whole bunch of docker

827
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,279
containers

828
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,600
it's kind of like a click um but it

829
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,799
takes about i don't know a minute or so

830
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
it's pretty quick the longest part is

831
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
just waiting for our zap scan to go

832
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,720
through so that i don't know if we

833
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
really touched on that too much but one

834
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,679
thing that you really need to consider

835
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,360
when when setting up all this automation

836
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
is how long does scanning take um you

837
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,159
know in some cases do you want to rush

838
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,760
things and just get it in then maybe you

839
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
want to pick you know either faster

840
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,799
scanners or leave out some of the other

841
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,960
ones that are too slow

842
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
it's really up to you and what the

843
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
organization needs

844
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,159
so so full disclosure we have an

845
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,919
existing running container with defect

846
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,320
dojo as well as juice shop juice shop

847
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
will be our target because hey we're all

848
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,799
alas friendly here i'm going to pull

849
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,360
this over here and hope it's readable oh

850
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,080
it's not give me a second

851
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
oops

852
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,120
there we go make this smaller

853
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,159
well that's not how to do it

854
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
is it this one

855
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,530
there we go

856
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,600
[Music]

857
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
that hopefully this is generally

858
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
readable

859
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,559
[Music]

860
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,720
okay here we go

861
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,440
so

862
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
i don't like typing there's a beautiful

863
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
thing called demo magic that types for

864
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,559
you all i have to do is hit enter so

865
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,159
here we go this is me typing really i

866
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,600
swear not really

867
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
so let's get the demo wish us luck

868
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
in the movies right yeah just like in

869
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
the movies

870
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,480
so

871
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,159
first let's set up the prerequisites

872
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,760
which i've done already and i showed you

873
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,679
we've got dojo and juice shop

874
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,520
that's our docker compose to fire those

875
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,679
up

876
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,000
okay let's go show people this is to

877
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
remind me to show you that which i

878
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,799
already did so i don't need to remind me

879
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,200
efficient yeah i'm efficient

880
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
so let's run the tests against those

881
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,559
targets

882
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,120
off we go we've just launched that ssl

883
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,880
and zap container

884
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,200
we're waiting for the zap to complete it

885
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
takes that's i think for 60 seconds 60

886
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,520
seconds we were testing on the hotel

887
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,679
wi-fi last night so you know mileage may

888
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,840
vary although complex wi-fi and hotel

889
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,600
wi-fi compete for being the most

890
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
interesting

891
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,399
yeah um

892
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,000
but what we're doing basically is

893
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,640
sparking up a ssli's

894
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,080
container pointing it at the target

895
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,679
sparking up as that container putting

896
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
out the target running the tests

897
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
writing them to a shared volume

898
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,159
that then will later read in and push

899
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,080
those results to

900
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,120
um defection

901
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,360
yeah

902
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
so how about those mets

903
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,480
oh wait the asteroids we could talk

904
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,000
about the asteroids how about those

905
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
astros did they win last night i didn't

906
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,399
see them oh they don't have your faces

907
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,760
this is how you vamp when you're waiting

908
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,279
for demos to finish right was that

909
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,880
second game or third game that was

910
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,640
second okay one to one then excellent

911
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,720
yeah yeah we're doing something

912
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
this won't age well though sorry people

913
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,279
watching this on youtube

914
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,600
you'll know

915
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,360
[Music]

916
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,600
those two foreign that we're running

917
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
and um not killing the network because

918
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,600
the same network is where defect dojo is

919
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,919
running at let me

920
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,880
jump over here

921
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,840
here's our defect

922
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,080
dojo oops if i hit refresh there we go

923
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,159
yeah we've got an active engagement if i

924
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,600
go look at

925
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
uh products you will see we now have the

926
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,440
juice shop project created it wasn't

927
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,039
there before

928
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,120
i can drill into the juice shop project

929
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
and look at

930
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
the engagements

931
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
here is our engagement we just did

932
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,840
and ssl this is running on localhost so

933
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
there's nothing for sslis for zap we

934
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,640
have six results

935
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,200
and

936
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
here's our zap test and we can drill

937
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
into there

938
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,440
wait where am i clicking that's so hard

939
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,159
to click over your shoulder

940
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,799
oh here we go there they are

941
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
small screen resolution fit me

942
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,200
so here's our results right so we've run

943
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,360
in a minute two different tools against

944
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,039
a particular api

945
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,200
or a particular app excuse me

946
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,799
and push those results where they needed

947
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
to go into

948
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
hey you come up here

949
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,320
nope hold on one second dang it windows

950
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,440
are tough

951
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
windows are tough in a

952
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,559
presentation

953
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,440
yes hey there we are there we go

954
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,399
so this is kind of just like an

955
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,679
infographic on what we were talking

956
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,000
about um just have docker spin up your

957
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,279
your

958
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,039
vulnerability management software aka

959
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,320
defect dojo and then whatever your

960
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,919
application is hopefully it's better

961
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,399
than juice shop

962
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,240
after that just doing all sorts of

963
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,159
testing it hopefully includes more than

964
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,640
just zap and sslis

965
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,240
and the way i set it up was i just kind

966
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
of had those reports and jumbled them

967
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
into a shared volume

968
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,720
and then on the next slide you jump into

969
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
another third-party container that

970
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,679
actually reads those the volumes and

971
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,880
takes those reports and shoves them into

972
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,960
the defect dojo um so one thing in the

973
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,159
demo that you might have noticed was

974
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,360
there were two zaps and two sslis

975
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,799
whenever we ran this this morning we

976
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
didn't clear out the volume so we just

977
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,480
kind of imported the same report twice

978
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,399
um from this morning and one live the

979
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,279
demo

980
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,720
um mileage may vary yeah just in case

981
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
connect two never hurts right you can

982
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,919
never have a little minor demo fail

983
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,960
right

984
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,480
that's what that's what was your earning

985
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,600
a day exactly um as always it's very

986
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,279
important to clean up all of your dirty

987
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
work uh we didn't hear today because

988
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,200
well jojo was running in tandem with you

989
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
shop but generally speaking you want to

990
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,240
get rid of all the evidence because you

991
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,279
don't want to be keeping around those

992
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,039
reports too long um

993
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,480
well the raw reports anyways you may

994
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
want to generate some formalized reports

995
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,360
that you want to pass to the dev team or

996
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,159
auditors or whoever may require them and

997
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,679
your cloud provider is happy to know you

998
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,120
for those things you forget to turn off

999
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,399
that's you

1000
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,519
if no other reason so key takeaways

1001
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,039
um understand to be clear about your

1002
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,480
scope i've said that a couple times i'm

1003
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,799
reiterating it now you can always expand

1004
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,399
that later so i would say don't be too

1005
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,760
aggressive if you're just launching this

1006
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,600
for the first time kind of you know pick

1007
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,000
your battles wisely i would start small

1008
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
and look for some easy wins to get some

1009
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
confidence and it kind of depends on

1010
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
what your sort of good will is with the

1011
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
rest of your company and if you're

1012
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,840
established and they trust you you may

1013
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
not have some uphill work but if you're

1014
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,279
a brand new drop into an abstract

1015
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,120
program you may have to do a little bit

1016
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,679
of politicking to make that happen

1017
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
and then think carefully about your your

1018
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,039
scanner choice right do you want a sort

1019
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,519
of custom focused test versus general ad

1020
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,960
hoc right do you want something that's

1021
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,519
only like testing you're a ruby shop so

1022
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,120
you have a rails test

1023
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,720
or do you just want a web app test to

1024
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
test generally generically web

1025
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,720
and are they general are they ad hoc do

1026
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
you want to be able to fire these off

1027
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
say per release or for a very quick

1028
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,880
cadence versus a like a weekly or some

1029
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,360
kind of a calendar cadence

1030
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,039
um open source scanners by the way they

1031
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,559
fly under the budget radar so if you

1032
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,919
want to start with open source scanners

1033
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,200
it's probably not a bad thing to do

1034
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,039
there's no approval for purchasing or

1035
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,880
budget to happen so i kind of like those

1036
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
when i'm starting out these kind of

1037
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,919
programs even though they may not be a

1038
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,279
perfect choice

1039
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,960
in all cases it's really nice to be able

1040
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,279
to prove it without spending money

1041
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,559
and then you can ask for money with some

1042
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,480
proof that it actually works

1043
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,799
commercial considerations how automation

1044
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,399
friendly is that tool

1045
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
this was several years ago where i tried

1046
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,240
to automate a commercial sas scanner

1047
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,519
when we talk to them they're like oh we

1048
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,440
have an api we have an api like awesome

1049
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
great i learned not to trust that answer

1050
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,440
because their api was a binary that i

1051
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,760
had to run locally but it's not an api

1052
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
that's a freaking client

1053
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
so i had to write python around that

1054
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,799
client to actually make calls to do

1055
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,120
automation it was ugly it was hacky code

1056
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,880
it worked but so find out how

1057
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
automation-friendly it is ask for the

1058
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,880
api docs so you can make sure the api

1059
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,240
actually provides those functions you

1060
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,760
need that's another place where i've

1061
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,679
been bit in the past and find out how

1062
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,080
sane and useful that api is right does

1063
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,360
it just tell you that a scan was

1064
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,799
completed and nothing else or can

1065
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,799
actually edit profiles with that api

1066
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,880
right how robust is that they're getting

1067
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
way better they used to be quite

1068
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,440
terrible you want to know how

1069
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,039
configurable that tool is if you want to

1070
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,600
do a targeted versus a a general crawl

1071
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,519
those kind of things are very important

1072
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,679
and what kind of crawl

1073
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,600
if does that tool have the kind of call

1074
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,880
that you need or do you need to

1075
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,240
supplement it with something like a

1076
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,600
browser driver

1077
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
selenium or those kind of things

1078
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,799
and then target selection right this is

1079
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,840
where you determine where to test

1080
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,440
if you're lucky you have an on-demand

1081
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,200
environment right you may have to deal

1082
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,039
with the static environment you honestly

1083
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,320
probably are going to have to deal with

1084
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,399
the static environment in most cases

1085
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,679
and that's okay you just need to know

1086
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,880
that up front

1087
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
if you have containers right this is

1088
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,919
great if you have particularly

1089
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,840
containers and cloud spinning those

1090
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,679
things up is okay as long as you can get

1091
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,600
access to your own little chunk of your

1092
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
cloud account

1093
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
um and then don't forget to tear those

1094
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
down because like i said cloud broader

1095
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
love to bill you for resources you

1096
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
didn't kill

1097
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,560
for some odd reason

1098
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,960
and then connecting with ci cd

1099
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,399
consider the cadence right this is

1100
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,918
always an interesting problem where you

1101
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,599
have to kind of balance how long the

1102
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,480
test takes versus how frequently i'm

1103
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,800
getting triggered to do an assessment

1104
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,480
right if your

1105
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
dev teams are moving really fast and

1106
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
you're trying to do a per

1107
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,159
let's say commit to master and those are

1108
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,159
happening three or four times a day and

1109
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,000
your test takes eight hours to do a full

1110
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,440
crawl

1111
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
that's a problem right you need to

1112
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,639
figure that out now one of the ways i've

1113
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,199
handled that is to have a non-braking

1114
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
test

1115
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
that gets fired on the first commit to

1116
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,639
master it runs for eight hours and maybe

1117
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
two or three more commits happen and i

1118
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,320
just have a way to tell hey that that

1119
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,760
thing is still running

1120
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,239
just skip this test for now and yes i

1121
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,560
don't break the build on that that run

1122
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,640
but i do get results at the end which is

1123
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
really kind of more important because if

1124
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,359
you're gonna break the build it better

1125
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
be bloody real or you're gonna get

1126
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
booted out of ci cd quicker than you can

1127
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,480
say something really short

1128
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,839
um

1129
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,280
and then long-running tests you do have

1130
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,079
to make sure they don't wrap on

1131
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,920
themselves i've made this mistake

1132
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,359
where i launch a test and then i launch

1133
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,200
a test and i have like six tests going

1134
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
because a bunch of events happened all

1135
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,880
in a row and i wasn't smart and checked

1136
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
to make sure there wasn't one

1137
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
concurrently running so just that's a

1138
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,760
great way to sort of shoot yourself in

1139
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,599
the foot if you're not careful with this

1140
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,359
automation

1141
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,640
and that's it we've reached the end of

1142
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,720
our fun and exciting journey so i'm matt

1143
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
tasara that's how they get a hold of me

1144
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,040
again he's cody yeah it's mafuchi i

1145
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
spell it wrong half the time so no no

1146
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,359
worries if you mispronounce it yeah

1147
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,078
that's the only way i remember

1148
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,118
we're talking

1149
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,119
yeah absolutely so that's it just

1150
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,320
repeating it in case the mike didn't

1151
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,240
pick it up uh he was asking why we

1152
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,079
didn't cover the aspect of taking the

1153
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:11,760
results and pushing them off to say

1154
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
specific backlogs for teens um tagging

1155
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,839
them or some such thing to make that

1156
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
happen i would completely recommend that

1157
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,680
i was trying to not make this talk take

1158
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,920
longer to be what with you but i

1159
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,760
absolutely agree like after you get

1160
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
these results done feeding them into the

1161
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
place where your developers expect to

1162
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
see them is exceedingly important i

1163
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
cannot emphasize how important it is

1164
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
because

1165
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,480
like shoving a i mean nobody likes

1166
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,079
getting the 500 paid pdf of of crap like

1167
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,520
as a developer i know how to deal with

1168
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,839
issues in jira right as a developer i do

1169
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,359
not want to get an email with a big fat

1170
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,680
pdf that i have to deal with like yeah

1171
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,839
yeah so totally absolutely that's like a

1172
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,040
release block or two like last second

1173
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
do what i didn't care especially if

1174
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,720
they're if that pdf before is like a

1175
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,960
potentially oh and the conversation to

1176
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
be a release blocker yeah that big

1177
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
report blocking a release is how you get

1178
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
booted out of

1179
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,599
um things and then shadow id happens

1180
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
around you because we can't tell the

1181
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
security guy because he's gonna shaft us

1182
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,359
again yeah no totally totally avoid that

1183
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,119
make friends and be nice

1184
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,800
