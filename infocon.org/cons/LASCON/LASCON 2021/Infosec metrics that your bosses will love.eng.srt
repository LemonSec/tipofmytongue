[Music]

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,240
hello everyone uh welcome to our talk

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,199
infosec metrics here bosses for love

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,039
twilio's been scaling for a few years

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,720
pretty rapidly and the security team

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,119
skilled as well and for the last couple

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,640
of years we have been

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
putting a lot of emphasis on metrics

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,520
both

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
uh internal and external what we provide

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
from the security organization

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
and fun fact is the lead engineer who

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,200
started this work a year ago is based

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,680
out of austin and she moved on from

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,480
trulia to another job so it's pretty

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,559
hilarious that we're here in austin

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
talking about the project she started

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,800
and she's not here in the conference

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,160
today

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
but yeah

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,320
if you're going to listen to us speak uh

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
for a while

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,760
okay so uh

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,040
you probably want to know something

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
about us my name is yash i'm the interim

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
director of security at twilio that

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
means i'm really really good at google

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,880
sheets excel budgeting

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,600
project management things like that

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
and i am from the bay area

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,040
and hey everyone i'm harini i am a

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
product security manager at twilio

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,279
and i'm from denver colorado

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,119
quick agenda for today at julia we

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,000
usually start every project or every big

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,680
initiative with why

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
so in that theme

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
we'll talk about why do we want metrics

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
then move into what metrics we can

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600
provide for as a security organization

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
then go into how we use studio metrics

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
for the last couple of years what was

43
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,759
missing from that

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
what went into designing the new

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
solution the motivations the

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,799
requirements

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,320
and then the implementation which would

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
go over the technical

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,119
details and things like that

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
with a small demo after that we talk

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,239
about if all of this effort worked what

52
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
we learned from it and where we're going

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
in the future with this effort and we'll

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,520
have ample time for q a at the end

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
cool

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,959
so why do we need metrics

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
quantification is important and it's

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
really hard to quantify security a

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
general product can be quantified in

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
terms of revenue customers and things

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,200
like that but security really can do

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,560
that

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,640
but you do need to quantify security in

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,319
some way otherwise it's going to be

65
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
looked at as a cost center to the

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,560
company you're always eating money as a

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
security team

68
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,480
one way to quantify security is through

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
metrics you could get a lot of numbers

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
and sort of show the improvement over

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
time of your security program of the

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
capabilities that you have what you had

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,519
a year ago what you have today where

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,200
you're going next

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,519
how widely are they being used how the

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
adaption has changed and how that has

77
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
led to the security posture of your

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
company changing over time and the

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
trends that you show over time over the

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
last year last six months those are

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,239
really important in sort of showing that

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,480
the money and resources that are going

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,959
into the security program of the company

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
really help in moving the needle

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
and you could take the gap analysis of

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,920
this and sort of use that to argue for

87
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,080
resources you can just go and say give

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
me 10 people and a million dollars but

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
you can say this is what you're doing

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
today this is what we need to do and to

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
do this we need a million dollars more

92
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
likely you'll get it then

93
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
what kind of metrics can you provide

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
i've broken down some of the metrics you

95
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
can provide based on sort of the pillars

96
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
of security

97
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
application security you could provide

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
metrics on

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,920
dependency security sas das container

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
scans

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
what you're using how widely they're

102
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
being used the rate of adoption

103
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
you could also talk about how many cves

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
are present in the environment how long

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
have they been there what the rate of

106
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,879
remediation is and things like that

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,560
moving into patch management you could

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,160
talk about the systems with latest

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,798
patches without the latest ones

110
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,360
hosts that are not on the golden ami

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,320
maybe hosts that are say 60 or 90 days

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
older in terms of moving to the new amis

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
moving along in cloud security you could

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
talk about users with unused keys

115
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
ip addresses exposed to the internet s3

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
buckets that maybe are unencrypted open

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
to the internet or a combination of both

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,360
albs without vafs

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
anything and everything that aws or

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
other cloud providers expose

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
and within enterprise security you could

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
talk about sort of edr solutions laptops

123
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
different types of laptops you have

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
linux mac versus windows how many with

125
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,600
or without edr agents presence

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
you could also do laptops on older os or

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
the laptops with one or more cves

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,199
present

129
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
and with an incident response you could

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
talk about the total number of incidents

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
you have had in the last x days or

132
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
months

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,639
mean time to remediate and things like

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
that like how long did it take to

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
identify the root cause how long what

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
did it take to page the right people and

137
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
all of those things

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
offensive security you have your

139
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,479
traditional sort of phishing metrics how

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,639
many clicks versus how many people open

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,320
the email how many entered their

142
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
credentials how many people reported the

143
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
fish how long did it take till the first

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
report came in

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
and all of the good stuff there

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
moving on before we dive deep into the

147
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
core of the metrics thing uh i want to

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,319
give you some context so that we're all

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,080
on the same page

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
when we go deeper

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
and i also needed a slide to put in some

152
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,039
buzzwords so i'll start with devsecops

153
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,759
we have a lot of security tooling within

154
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
twilio we have sas das container

155
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,440
scanning iac secrets scanning and things

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
like that all of those are implemented

157
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
within rcicd pipeline and we have

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
automation that files tickets in the

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,840
engineering team's jira queue from the

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,560
findings from all of these tools

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
and we also do manual reviews such as

162
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
threat models pen test

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,240
mini reviews like uh consults consoles

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
and things like that we have our bug

165
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,560
money program and we get submissions

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,160
from those as well

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,120
so for the manual reviews that we do we

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
have a task ticket or a master ticket

169
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,639
which is filed in the product security

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,280
teams jira queue

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
and this is relevant i'm not just going

172
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,680
randomly into this

173
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
so tldr on a high level we have

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
vulnerability tickets that are filed in

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
the engineering team's queue and we have

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
task tickets that go into our own queue

177
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,440
and this is what we kind of used and

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
harini will talk about this later to

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,759
sort of get the numbers to show how much

180
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,199
effort we were putting in and what

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,360
result was coming out the other thing

182
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,520
i'll probably mention is twilio has the

183
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
concept of business units or bus so most

184
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
of the metrics that we talk about would

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
be catered to it's like

186
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,479
the security posture of a bu

187
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,880
or number of p1's in a bu

188
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
you could use it pretty interchangeably

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
and sort of uh identify this with you

190
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
could move it to security posture of a

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
product or a feature group or however

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,880
it's pretty flexible that way

193
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,639
with that out of the way

194
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
how are we doing metrics before all of

195
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,280
this

196
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,919
we have the office of the cso which was

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,160
which is in charge of all the security

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
metrics that we provide

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
they send out an email every month

200
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
saying hey managers and leads uh give me

201
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,800
your metrics by

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
the end of the week or something like

203
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,199
that

204
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,360
people like me pretty much forgot and

205
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
then do didn't do it so

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
i usually got another email and a

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,919
slightly annoyed slack message saying

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,120
hey didn't you get my first email

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
then i go take out the metrics g sheet

210
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
go to each of the different tools that

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
we have get the data from there

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
go to jira dig out all the data from

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
there and this is all the data that i

214
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,240
mentioned tickets of threat models

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
findings and all of those

216
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,880
and then aggregate all of them put them

217
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,479
in the g sheet

218
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,799
and then look out for any comments in

219
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,360
the g sheet answer those comments and

220
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
then sort of send all of those back and

221
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
say hey metrics for this month have been

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
updated

223
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,320
i wasn't really happy doing that every

224
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
month

225
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
aside from my sort of unhappiness there

226
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
were a bunch of other things that were

227
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
missing

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
there wasn't any automation it was like

229
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,120
a human going and clicking a bunch of

230
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
buttons getting data and giving it and

231
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
that wasn't scalable

232
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
there wasn't a good visualization of

233
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
trends it was more like excel sheets

234
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
with numbers sure there was

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
visualization but not enough or as much

236
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
as we wanted it to be

237
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
and the data wasn't near real time we

238
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,959
did this on a monthly basis so the data

239
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,360
got stale pretty quickly if there was a

240
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
p1 mid month that didn't show up in the

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
monthly metrics

242
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
it wasn't customizable for different

243
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
audience we had one set of metrics

244
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
for the e-team and we had the same set

245
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
of metrics for engineers as well

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,720
and that doesn't really work

247
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
uh we didn't have r back so we did we

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,800
did have the r back of the g sheet and

249
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
sort of google backed our back but

250
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,680
all the metrics were in one g sheet so i

251
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
could fat finger somebody else's numbers

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
too

253
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,880
and let's face it it wasn't cool enough

254
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
to get into any cfp

255
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
there were also a few unanswered

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
questions

257
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
the cso wanted to know

258
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,279
what data do we do you have for me to

259
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,000
sort of go to the board and sort of help

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
get more resources for you

261
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,760
and the e-team wants to know what's the

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,079
security posture of each bu

263
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
now we had answers to these but every

264
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,000
time these questions get asked we had to

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,880
go dig up the data and then answer them

266
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
and if they ask pretty regularly which

267
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,399
they should

268
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,560
again that was a lot of manual work

269
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
and similarly engineering managers

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
wanted to know which ones their teams

271
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
needed to fix and they needed very

272
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,560
different data they needed the technical

273
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
aspects of the vulnerability the exact

274
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
fix that needed to go in them and

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
similarly product managers wanted to

276
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
know what was wrong in their product how

277
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
to prioritize where to start which ones

278
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,519
were easy wins which needed a lot of

279
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
planning and things like that

280
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,399
and then over the last one one and a

281
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
half year we've been working on changing

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
this sort of automating the process and

283
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
trying to get better

284
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
at getting metrics and making them near

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
real time and harini is going to talk

286
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,519
about how we did this uh i'll be back

287
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,120
almost at the end to take credit for all

288
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
of it again

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
thanks josh so

290
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
before we started working on the actual

291
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
solution like we had all these people

292
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
just reach out to us asking for

293
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
different data and we weren't quite sure

294
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,320
what exactly were they actually looking

295
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,640
for so we first started working on

296
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
understanding the requirements for this

297
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
right the first thing we wanted to

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
understand was what did leadership want

299
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
they wanted to get like a very high

300
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
level overview of what was the security

301
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
posture of all products across twilio

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
what did that look like and what are

303
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
some of the key areas that we should be

304
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
focusing as different business units and

305
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,200
where should we put our resources to

306
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
work on

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
we then had like engineering managers

308
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,519
and pms reaching out and asking for

309
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
different type of data what they wanted

310
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
to see was hey give me a list of all

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,000
vulnerabilities that are p ones and p

312
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
zeros and tell me what vulnerabilities

313
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
have not been fixed within a given sla

314
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
like i need to know that information so

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,800
we can get to get uh work on getting an

316
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,120
idea to fix things soon earlier than

317
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
later they also wanted to see like for

318
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
my business unit what does the trend of

319
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
vulnerabilities sort of look like like

320
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
are we closing issues uh are we opening

321
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,760
like are we having issues that are out

322
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,320
of sla for a longer period of time

323
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,000
what are some of the sources where our

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
vulnerabilities are coming from and by

325
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
sources here we mean some of the

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
capabilities that we provide as product

327
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
security so we do bug bounty programs we

328
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,440
have pen tests that happen we have sas

329
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,839
scans dash cans containers cans a bunch

330
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
of different things so

331
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,680
leadership from an engineering manager

332
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
and product manager and pm standpoint

333
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,519
they wanted to understand like tell me

334
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,519
all of this information so we can start

335
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,800
focusing on things and figure out like

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
which part of the stlc cycle we can

337
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
focus more on security and how are we

338
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,079
capturing all these issues

339
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
one other major requirement that they

340
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,800
had was hey do not give me a tool where

341
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
i have to go back again log in i have to

342
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
like go through a bunch of different

343
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
things to get this data i need something

344
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,760
that would work well and integrate well

345
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
with my day-to-day workflow so it's easy

346
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
for me when i'm doing my planning it's

347
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
easy for me to get that information and

348
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,880
it's it's right with me at that point

349
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
and when they asked us for this we

350
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
started thinking internally like

351
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,720
what would be the best way for us to

352
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
have some sort of an access control set

353
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
on these systems because if we are going

354
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
to just give the data out to everybody

355
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,079
out there

356
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,160
what if somebody just changes something

357
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,519
what if somebody ends up deleting

358
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
something even by accident so we didn't

359
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,079
want that

360
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,760
so that was also one of the requirements

361
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,079
that we had after listening to all these

362
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,079
uh requirements that the other ems and

363
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,480
pms had

364
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,360
and

365
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
we as product security started building

366
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
off this metrics within the larger trust

367
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,240
and security organization at twilio

368
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
the intention was to not show leadership

369
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
just product security data so we wanted

370
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
to start off with building something and

371
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
we wanted to help other teams within

372
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,519
security to contribute to the same

373
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,480
concept

374
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
so we wanted to have a solution which

375
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
was as extensible as possible that way

376
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,639
we had data coming from multiple

377
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,720
security teams which would all feed into

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
this one single metrics dashboard which

379
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,399
will show leadership like the full

380
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,839
picture of security within the

381
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,360
organization

382
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,800
and

383
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,399
i know i've said this a couple of times

384
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,440
now but

385
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
different people wanted to see different

386
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,519
data not everybody wanted to see the

387
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
same information so we had to build

388
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
something that was very flexible so that

389
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
we were able to create different metrics

390
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,440
based on who our audiences were

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,320
and finally with all these requirements

392
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
we internally as product security we

393
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
discussed through this and we were like

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
let's build something but let's not make

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
it over complicated and we also wanted

396
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
to make sure that this solution was

397
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
maintainable because to yash's point if

398
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,920
someone's going to come and ask us at

399
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
any point of time to give metrics we

400
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
didn't want to go back and forth fix our

401
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
automation do a bunch of different work

402
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
to just get this data so we wanted to

403
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
make sure the solution that we came up

404
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,040
with was easy to maintain as well

405
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,079
with all these requirements in hand

406
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
before moving on to the actual

407
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
implementation we did some analysis to

408
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
figure out okay so we have these

409
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
requirements we know where our data is

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,399
but what does the data that we have look

411
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
like so to give you some context uh we

412
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,920
use our all our issues are trapped using

413
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
our issue management system using jira

414
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
and what we identified was we had a

415
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
bunch of different jira projects and we

416
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
had a lot of vulnerabilities within the

417
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
jira projects but we had no context of

418
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
how to map these tickets all the way up

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
to a business unit so we went on to

420
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,839
figuring out how can we use the current

421
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
product taxonomy within our company and

422
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
map it all the way back to jira

423
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
in that process we worked on setting a

424
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
baseline for the vulnerability ticketing

425
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,240
process itself within the organization

426
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
so what we did as part of that was we

427
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
understood that there are some key

428
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
pieces of information which if present

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,759
within these tickets would help us tell

430
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,600
a different story or a better story to

431
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,759
the uh leadership and like anybody

432
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
looking at the data

433
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,920
so we worked with the uh the atlassian

434
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,079
team within twilio to add a few things

435
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,639
within our vulnerability tickets things

436
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
such as vulnerability source

437
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
vulnerability category and also the

438
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,639
business units that a specific jira

439
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,320
ticket or jira project mapped all the

440
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,839
way back to

441
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,320
we did have some of this data already

442
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,399
within our tickets but what we did

443
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
before was we used the concept of labels

444
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
within jira

445
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,120
and

446
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,600
if if you're not familiar with jira the

447
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,680
label system within it can get really

448
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
really messy really soon because it's

449
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
case sensitive so what we identified was

450
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,639
for the same source we had like five

451
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
different labels that we had to query

452
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
through we may miss

453
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
like a specific case and we realized

454
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
that we are missing a few tickets

455
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
because it was case sensitive and we

456
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,880
didn't include everything

457
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
so in that process we had to make sure

458
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
we set a baseline for tickets and that

459
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
would help us get the right data that we

460
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
were looking for

461
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,199
so like i mentioned there were older

462
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
tickets with all these labels so we had

463
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,199
to make sure that we upskilled our jql

464
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,679
skills and got all the data that had to

465
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,799
be part of the metrics

466
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
so um once we did these groundwork we

467
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,319
moved on to the actual implementation

468
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,080
like i mentioned our all our

469
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
vulnerabilities were tracked within

470
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
jeera and it's not just vulnerabilities

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
to um

472
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,520
to what josh mentioned we also have like

473
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
task type tickets that we track within

474
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
product security to understand what are

475
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
the different work and support that we

476
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
provide the engineering team so all the

477
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
data was present in jira

478
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
and we wrote an automation based on

479
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
python which sort of collected all of

480
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,440
this data from jira and i'll talk a

481
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
little bit more about that in the next

482
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,320
slides

483
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
and once we got all of this data from

484
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
python we moved on to writing that to a

485
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
google sheet which served as a data

486
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,039
source for google data studio for the

487
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
dashboards that we were going to uh

488
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
build on for all these metrics

489
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
before jumping on to showing the actual

490
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,960
metrics dashboard um just wanted to give

491
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,799
you folks a quick understanding of why

492
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
we picked this stack

493
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
because python was a language that most

494
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,320
of us were comfortable with in the

495
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
product security team and it was easy

496
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
because there were a lot of integrations

497
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,240
with python and google sheet with the

498
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,240
google libraries so we just went with

499
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
that approach

500
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
and we stick to using google data sheet

501
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,520
because uh

502
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,080
google data studio had the option of

503
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,559
importing multiple data sources

504
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,720
it had the option of importing from sql

505
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
from different data stores but

506
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
google sheets was pretty much

507
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
lightweight and we were able to easily

508
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,480
integrate it with google data studio

509
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
without any additional uh authentication

510
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,559
or anything like that so we went on to

511
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
just using google sheet

512
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
and

513
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,039
josh wanted us to build this metrics but

514
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
he didn't give us the budget we did not

515
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,880
have the budget to work on this so we

516
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
went with using google data studio

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
because there was no additional cost

518
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,280
associated with it and we also realized

519
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,120
that it has a lot of rich features that

520
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
we could leverage to show what the

521
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
leadership and what anybody else who

522
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,320
were looking for who wanted to look for

523
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,520
about our security portion

524
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
so with that said uh i'll give a quick

525
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,559
demo of how this all works end to end um

526
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,120
i wanted to give a live demo but i don't

527
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
really trust the demo gods so i just

528
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,240
went with a live-ish version of this

529
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
so bear with me while i play this video

530
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,360
for you and walk you through this

531
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
process

532
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,240
um

533
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,960
like i mentioned uh jira is our source

534
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
of truth so we got all of the

535
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,280
information from jira and we just mocked

536
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,120
up this data for the purposes of the

537
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
presentation

538
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
but the way we have the automation built

539
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
out is

540
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
within python

541
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,480
we worked on collecting all this data

542
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
from jira but we also had to do a lot of

543
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
normalization so that's why we had the

544
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
automation in place and when i say

545
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,799
normalization it was essentially us

546
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,280
trying to figure out like what severity

547
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,159
a specific ticket aligned with

548
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,840
getting all information based off of

549
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
labels or the new fields that we had

550
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,400
created we also did a bunch of

551
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
calculations and everything within the

552
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
automation that way when we wrote the

553
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
data to the sheet we had all the

554
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
information that it could easily take

555
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
and be fed directly to google data

556
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
studio

557
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
um so we had information like

558
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
the project information this business

559
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,159
unit it mapped to different categories

560
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
of vulnerabilities the sources

561
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
things such as uh whether or not it was

562
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,559
out of certain sla time frame and what

563
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,240
was sort of the actual link to the

564
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,000
tickets and i'll talk about

565
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,159
why we added the information about a

566
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,880
link to the tickets in a second so this

567
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
is the security metrics dashboard that

568
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,640
we had used

569
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,200
and the way the dashboard is built is

570
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,679
it's built into three different parts so

571
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
google data studio has the option for

572
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,280
you to create i think up to like five

573
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,120
pages where you can have this

574
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
information so we had the very first

575
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,240
page where we had added information that

576
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,159
the leadership wanted to see

577
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,240
so the metrics that dashboard

578
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,880
essentially had information about like

579
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,039
across the different business units what

580
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,679
did like p1 and p0s look like and how

581
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,679
many were open over a certain period of

582
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
time we also showed like all

583
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
vulnerabilities across all business

584
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,600
units over a period of time and had the

585
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
option of sort of filtering it through

586
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,760
different business units to see

587
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,159
what that trend sort of looked like and

588
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,320
which business units had to focus more

589
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
on the security issues and where we had

590
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
to put our resources to work in

591
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
uh moving on the second part of this

592
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
dashboard essentially was catered to be

593
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,080
useful for the security teams ourselves

594
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
this dashboard essentially this is just

595
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,120
a short example of how we broke things

596
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
down based on the source but we also had

597
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,280
information about different categories

598
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,760
of vulnerabilities so with both of these

599
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,640
information the idea was to see across

600
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
all the business units like which of our

601
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
sources was giving us well information

602
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,919
about if or when in the process of stlc

603
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,120
lifecycle where we catching

604
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,280
vulnerabilities so

605
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
just as an example if you could see

606
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,480
based on this uh chart that we see here

607
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
dependency scans and threat models are

608
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
catching more vulnerabilities

609
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
more than pentest and bug bounty

610
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
programs so that sort of gives us an

611
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,440
idea of how are in which stage of sdlc

612
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,520
are we providing more support versus

613
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,159
which state stages need like much more

614
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,039
support and we based on the information

615
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,799
from categories we could also start

616
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,400
looking at

617
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
what classes of vulnerabilities are

618
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
present across different business units

619
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,240
and what are some of the capabilities

620
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,000
that we should be focusing on based on

621
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
the classes of vulnerabilities that we

622
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
are seeing across

623
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,720
all the

624
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,400
all the uh business units at twilio so

625
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
this essentially is just a view that

626
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
both even like leadership outside of

627
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
security or within security could use

628
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
and the third and final version of this

629
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
that we have is

630
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
the information that ems and pms were

631
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,480
looking for

632
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,120
so they wanted to dig deep into all the

633
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,039
issues that were identified within their

634
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,760
organization so as part of that

635
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
we have we built this dashboard for all

636
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,159
of those folks who wanted to see that

637
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,760
information so

638
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
the dashboard essentially has

639
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
detailed information of breakdown across

640
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,279
different severity source

641
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
and a small table which actually showed

642
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
them information of like all the jira

643
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,880
issues associated with their business

644
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,559
units or products

645
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,880
and as you can see we also had the

646
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,039
capability to filter sort of based on

647
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,279
different business units so

648
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,080
folks can just go go in look at whatever

649
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
data that they want to look for and get

650
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,360
an idea of what is happening in terms of

651
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
security vulnerabilities across their

652
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
specific business units the table is

653
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,240
also can be filtered based on issues

654
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
that you want to see if it's just open

655
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
issues or issues out of sla and all that

656
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
information

657
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,799
and just to give you a high level of

658
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,640
what this all looks like from the back

659
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,080
end so

660
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
you can see the data source that we have

661
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,520
imported there is essentially the google

662
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
sheet

663
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
and each of the fields that we set here

664
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,279
are based on all the information that we

665
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
gathered from the google sheets so the

666
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,200
table has different dimensions and all

667
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
of this information is essentially what

668
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,760
we got based on our automation that

669
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
wrote to the google sheets

670
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,240
one cool thing about google data studio

671
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,480
is that it gives you the option to

672
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
actually create and

673
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
customize like

674
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
fields or filters within google data

675
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
studio itself so you can just get all

676
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
the data into your google sheet and you

677
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
can actually create your filters and

678
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,039
everything within the google data studio

679
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
itself you don't have to manipulate any

680
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
data within your google sheets

681
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,039
and

682
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,039
finally to address the requirement of

683
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,120
hey give me something that aligns well

684
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,840
with my workflow google data studio has

685
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,320
the option of embedding uh the metrics

686
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
or the dashboard with whatever uh

687
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
systems that we use so we have

688
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,919
we primarily use uh confluence or wiki

689
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,919
and um that has a plugin where you can

690
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,720
just embed html content so using that

691
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
option uh just copied like or created

692
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
like a html uh hyperlink to the

693
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,679
dashboard

694
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,720
copied it to our wiki and

695
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,559
there we had the data so teams could

696
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,120
just directly go to their specific wiki

697
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,520
page look at this data within that

698
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
workflow itself and it's still

699
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,039
interactable you can still create

700
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,039
filters and everything within wiki

701
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,799
itself you don't have to go all the way

702
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,559
back to google data studio to get this

703
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,720
information

704
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
and it made their lives easier so during

705
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,559
planning they could just pull this up

706
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,480
they knew what what are all the things

707
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,240
that they had to focus on for a specific

708
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,760
sprint and they got all of this

709
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
information out of it

710
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,240
and finally to handle our back

711
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,640
we just had to make sure that nobody

712
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,720
else had access to create more filters

713
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,360
or modify the dashboards so we just

714
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,760
leveraged google's existing rpac system

715
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
and access was given only to certain

716
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
folks within the product security team

717
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,880
and as we integrate other teams uh

718
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
within security we'll give access to

719
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,799
them but from an engineering perspective

720
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,720
everybody just had read-only access so

721
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,159
they could just get the data that they

722
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,360
were looking for from the dashboard

723
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
all right that was a lot of talks so

724
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,760
i'll give this back to yosh to walk us

725
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,799
through

726
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,880
how this whether this worked or not and

727
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,000
how it helped different teams

728
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
cool so we did that and then we started

729
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
uh publicizing a little bit and

730
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,360
when we reflected off like did this work

731
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,240
or was this work not worth the effort

732
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,400
that went into it no we found that the

733
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
execs liked it i don't know if they

734
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
loved it but they're pretty receptive to

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
it i think they got what they wanted

736
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,679
because when you present a list of

737
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,360
security issues and say the company

738
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,600
needs to fix it the question becomes

739
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,760
okay who should i go talk to within the

740
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,799
company

741
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,440
and this these dashboards actually

742
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,200
address those issues where you could say

743
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
bux or product x nix needs to work on

744
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,440
these issues so go talk to the gm or svp

745
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,559
or however

746
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,000
the titles work

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,880
so that did work

748
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
and we were able to customize the

749
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,919
dashboards as harini showed you for

750
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,679
different audiences we had really low

751
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,320
level information for pms and engineers

752
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
and we had high level sort of

753
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
risk level information for the

754
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,640
leadership team

755
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,399
the thing that actually sealed this for

756
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
me is when a couple of engineers team

757
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
engineering teams came to me and said

758
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
look you've got really valuable data but

759
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,200
your analytic skills suck can we get

760
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,720
access to the data so we can actually

761
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,039
create better dashboards than this and

762
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
they took that made their own dashboards

763
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,960
and sort of gave them back to us and we

764
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
didn't really steal them

765
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,919
and product managers also got enough

766
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,480
data to say okay here are p1's that are

767
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
almost out of sla or out of sla so they

768
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
could do their sprint plannings and

769
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,120
quarterly plannings accordingly and all

770
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,200
in all we did see the needle move on

771
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,720
this

772
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
now everything does didn't work as we

773
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,919
expected it to some stuff did break uh

774
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,799
google data studio sometimes broke i

775
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
uh once i actually took this and was

776
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
super excited to show it to my boss and

777
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,799
when i opened it the integration just

778
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,840
broke

779
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
there are a few caveats there's a race

780
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,480
condition actually which needs a manual

781
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,000
refresh

782
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
if you change the data source and it

783
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,679
doesn't sync up back and it's a 15

784
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,360
minute windows if you do it within that

785
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,880
it needs sometimes needs a manual

786
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
refresh

787
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
cool

788
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
what are we going to do next

789
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,640
so

790
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,399
there are a lot of data sources that can

791
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,159
go into the dashboard so what we're

792
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,840
working on next is working with the

793
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,440
other security teams within the

794
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
organization to sort of get all of their

795
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,320
data could be patch management could be

796
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,240
cloud security could be

797
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,120
offensive like all of those metrics

798
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
the teams now have the capability and

799
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,080
sort of flexibility to put their data

800
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
into any source that they want to like a

801
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,720
database like a g sheet anything that

802
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
google data studio supports and then

803
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,880
integrate it into one central metrics

804
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,080
dashboard and once they do that you have

805
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,399
all the data in one place where you can

806
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,200
sort of come up with a risk score it

807
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
could be any formula that you come up

808
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,600
with things like number of p ones times

809
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,320
ten or how as a factor of how long

810
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,480
they've been open uh anything that you

811
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,399
come up with and sort of grade your

812
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,799
product from like a security perspective

813
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,720
and sort of really get a

814
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
view that says product a is at b minus

815
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
product c is at a plus

816
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,480
and things like that and parallelly

817
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
we're also working on individually

818
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
customizing dashboards for different

819
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
teams and getting them to habitually

820
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,320
look at this scorecard every off every

821
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,159
so often that they do planning and sort

822
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,240
of make security part of every

823
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
engineering team's planning process

824
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,840
because it's now hey look at your

825
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
backlog take a few tickets put it into

826
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,000
the sprint we want it to be look at your

827
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
backlog also look at your security

828
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
backlog and then take appropriate

829
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,320
tickets and then put it to your sprint

830
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
cool that was a lot of talk a lot of

831
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
demos we have all the data up

832
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,039
slides are on box the google data studio

833
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
dashboards and the

834
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
sample

835
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,399
g sheet that went into it as a data

836
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,960
source is also shared

837
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,440
it's dummy data it's publicly accessible

838
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,360
please make a copy play around and let

839
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,200
us know what you think

840
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,480
the qr code i promise is not malicious

841
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
it'll take you to a folder which has all

842
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
of these things in there for you to

843
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,279
download and play around with

844
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,799
and i have to do this

845
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,960
we have more than 10 security jobs open

846
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
we like to do things differently so if

847
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,320
you're interested please take a look

848
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
we'll be around here for the rest of the

849
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,960
day if you want to come chat with us

850
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,880
and if you have any questions we'd be

851
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,440
happy to answer them

852
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
yes

853
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,000
did you look at any uh vendors or other

854
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,760
tools that might be somewhere before you

855
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
start down

856
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
we did look at a few vendors and in the

857
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
spirit of the conference i'm not going

858
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
to go through what each vendor did but

859
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,600
what we found out as a general team was

860
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,959
all of the vendors were

861
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,799
needing you to do vulnerability

862
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,279
management a specific way and that's

863
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,279
when they give you the metrics so what

864
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,919
it meant was we take what we used to do

865
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,000
and then change it completely into how

866
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,080
they want us to do and then get the

867
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,519
metrics and that's something we didn't

868
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,600
want to do

869
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,600
yes

870
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
that's just a plug-in available within

871
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,360
uh atlassian store for wiki or

872
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,000
confluence so and it's uh i think easily

873
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
available it's they don't charge for it

874
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,679
you can just integrate that and that

875
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,600
will help you with integrating whatever

876
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,399
data that you're looking for

877
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,840
would you have done anything differently

878
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,960
if you were working with bus that had

879
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,360
thousands of security issues in their

880
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,640
backlog

881
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,320
you know like a say a legacy product

882
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,799
um the way we kind of approached this is

883
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,360
we didn't go all in and say here's all

884
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,840
of your data because that as we all know

885
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
gets messy the approach we took was get

886
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,399
all the p1's

887
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,080
get all the vulnerabilities that have a

888
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,519
fix available and sort of more

889
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,320
actionable and sort of go step by step

890
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
uh that would probably apply apply to

891
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,880
any product group or bu that has a lot

892
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,600
of security tech debt

893
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,000
yes so you have the retinal modeling on

894
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,240
there as a metric were people creating

895
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
euros for every

896
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,760
down program

897
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,600
there were two kind of metrics we got

898
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,919
from there one is how many threat models

899
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,320
we were doing so the threat model master

900
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,000
ticket as i like to call it is a ticket

901
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
that we filed for ourselves saying hey

902
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,080
we're doing a threat model for this team

903
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,840
so that tells us how many threat models

904
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,640
we're doing per business unit how many

905
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,320
we are not doing per once if there's a

906
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,840
business unit that has like zero threat

907
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
models in the last 30 days or 60 days

908
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,159
that's a gap we need to address and then

909
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,640
coming to the actual threats we found

910
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
yes we were filing tickets in the

911
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
engineering team's queue for the

912
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,399
findings from the threat models and they

913
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,480
would have sort of the categories and

914
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,839
sort of information of this is the

915
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,079
business unit this is the finding from a

916
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,480
threat model so automatically from jira

917
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
in the dashboard it would show up as

918
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,879
like uh seven or eight items from a

919
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,279
threat model in q1 or q2 were found

920
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,159
yes created their own i guess specific

921
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,079
dashboards you talk a little bit about

922
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,918
how that helped

923
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,520
so

924
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,879
what they were looking for is more super

925
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,599
granular per team so they took the data

926
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,440
and based on the fields we had in the g

927
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,119
sheet made filters that would give them

928
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,280
exactly that because

929
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,359
team a didn't care how many open tickets

930
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
team b had to some extent rate i mean

931
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
yes when you gamified things that that's

932
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,720
a different story but when you're doing

933
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
sprint planning you want to know exactly

934
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,880
how many tickets are in your backlog to

935
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,119
be able to pull some so those were the

936
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,480
things that they built filters for

937
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,880
awesome thank you for your time and if

938
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
you have any more questions we'll be

939
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,900
hanging around here

940
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,459
