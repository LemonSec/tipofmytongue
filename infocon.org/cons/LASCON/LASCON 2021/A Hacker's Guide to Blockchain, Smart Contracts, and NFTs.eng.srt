3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
uh i want to give a shout out to kate my

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,240
one of my number one supporters in the

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,279
city

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,760
always appreciate your fam

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,439
uh it's good to be in person i see a

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
couple of familiar faces y'all probably

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
don't think i'm familiar because i have

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,440
i cut my beard off so

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
many of you might not recognize me

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
this handsome young looking man when i

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
was walking through

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
all right cool so i got a pretty cool

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,120
talk uh that uh i think is a cool talk

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
and i think this talk is super important

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,480
because i think this talk is kind of

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
like the future where we're going in

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
security for the next couple of years

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,960
i think that there's going to be a

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,680
couple of people in here that if

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
there's going to be some skeptics in

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
here i'm a skeptical son of a gun myself

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
uh

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
you know because i mean i think that

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,040
part of the the whole cyber community

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
community cyber security and hacker

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
community and people has been looking at

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
applications forever and and the nature

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,159
of our job is to be skeptical and i'm

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
super skeptical however i think that

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
that all this stuff

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,360
i've been a skeptic on blockchain crypto

34
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,040
cryptocurrencies uh i just got into

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
smart contracts and and researching them

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,079
and also i'm actually that's the art i

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
drew for my i'm doing an nft collection

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,479
funny enough

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,520
so uh

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
that's my art

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
and uh

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,759
and so

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,159
the reason why i got into it uh one of

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,479
my favorite um

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
one of my favorite like uh self-help

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
type motivational guy i'm a big fan of

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
gary vaynerchuk anybody like garyvee in

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
here yes or no

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
a couple of people like gary vee uh some

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,600
people hate him maybe some people hate

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,399
me some people love me same thing so i

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,079
identify with him a lot

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
um but anyway he was talking about how

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
you could raise money for non-profits

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
and all that stuff and and you could do

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
all kind of different uh usage of nfts

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
when i was growing up i was actually an

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,599
artist and i i said draw a lot i wanted

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
to be an architect when i was young

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,480
uh

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
and then like i found out that oh you

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
need you actually got to go to college

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
and

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
pay for school and all that stuff to be

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
an architect and

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
and uh and i was i was born like super

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
poor i'm from marlin texas anybody been

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,120
a marlin in here

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,519
a couple people yeah yeah

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,519
so i'm from a small little town so

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,120
there's no way in heck i was going to be

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
able to go to college to be architect

73
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
however i had a second love ever since i

74
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,680
saw war games i wanted to get into

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
computers and

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,560
and that's my favorite hacker movie of

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
all time i didn't know that was a hacker

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
movie when i was young

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,519
but ever since i

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
is that some feedback

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,239
no all right cool all right so ever

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,920
since i was young i was like hey i want

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
to work computers and i love art

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,440
and so uh this is actually pretty funny

85
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
because the whole this nft and then

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
blockchain when i was 18 years old i

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
went to the military

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
and in the military i did cryptography i

89
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,959
did i was in the u.s navy i did

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,680
cryptography signals intelligence and

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
all kinds of stuff if i told you what i

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
did in the military i had to kill

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,599
everybody in the room and we're not

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,798
trying to have no violence out here

95
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
so this is a little bit of my background

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,000
um

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
so i'm a tech i'm a tech entrepreneur

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
about six seven years ago

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
a 2014 i don't even know i lost count

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,400
i started a company uh many many people

101
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,519
that know me

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,159
i sold this company two years ago uh and

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,280
i sold it to this company called

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,519
reliaquest and i currently work for a

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,000
lot of quests i do all kind of research

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
uh i end up i write a lot of malware now

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
uh my my day job is writing like

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,360
ransomware and trying to bypass stuff

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,120
and all kind of cool stuff so i'm doing

110
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,439
a lot of code so it's a cool departure

111
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
from where i was before what i was doing

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
as as a ceo of my company i was a lot of

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
sales and marketing and stuff now i'm

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
back to the grind where i just write

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
code all the time and i'm back on my

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
grind and i'm hacking

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,478
so i was in the navy eight years again

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,959
intelligence community stuff

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,919
i i was actually very technical at nsa

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
uh and i was the first member in the

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
military on a couple of different teams

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
so i'm really fortunate to have the the

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
the background that i have

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
uh also i do i have i have i have

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
patents in cryptography um i've done

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,120
some pretty cool stuff regarding

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
cryptography and cyber security i have

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
patents and those things i'm also arthur

129
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,000
people some people may know that we did

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
the tribal hackers series uh we did four

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
books tribal hackers and then at the

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
beginning of the pandemic what i did as

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
i wrote two children's books and

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
illustrated them

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
so the whole the whole art thing has

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
always been a part of my life the

137
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
cryptography funny enough has been a

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
part of my life and there's definitely a

139
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,039
lot of cryptography in the crypto space

140
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,360
and all that and so i was like well i

141
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
want to do some i want to see if i can

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
do some art and and see if i can sell it

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
and

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
and see if i can help people out so

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
that's the that's what got me like deep

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
down this rabbit hole

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,120
and actually my my my boss i worked for

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
the cto a lot of questions he said hey

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
look people are asking about blockchain

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,440
security

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
and so this is like a combination of

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
everything coming together uh so how

153
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
many of y'all working uh any blockchain

154
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
people in here anybody done serious work

155
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
on it i have a couple people so forgive

156
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
me if i'm gonna say a lot of stuff wrong

157
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,320
here

158
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
and so have patience with me uh i'm just

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
i just tell people i'm just a dumb

160
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,560
country boy trying to figure stuff out

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
so if if i say anything wrong wait to

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
the end and correct me and i'll make

163
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
sure that we correct them if i'm like

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,160
blatantly wrong all right don't don't be

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
ticky-tacked but you know what i'm

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,400
saying

167
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
but hopefully everybody in here

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
blockchain is the future 100 percent

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
and in the security professionals we

170
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
need to understand how smart contracts

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,240
work

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,000
we need to understand what language is

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
being used we need to understand the

174
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,199
forms that these things are being used

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,840
in

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,160
and this will be a good primer i think

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
some of you all are going to go and

178
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
hopefully if y'all do stuff based on you

179
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
know this is going to be a problem for

180
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
some people is this your first time like

181
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,440
trying to take a deep dive into this yes

182
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
or no anybody

183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,039
you can raise your hand yeah cool couple

184
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,319
people y'all scared to raise your hand

185
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,120
for all these smart people i understand

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,039
so this is going to be a dive and i'm

187
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,400
going to give you the resources you need

188
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,560
to continue uh that's kind of like what

189
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,360
i do

190
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,280
i'm like this i'm a stunt man pretty

191
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
much i do all these crazy stuff research

192
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
and then i give it to everybody else and

193
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
y'all gonna do way more with this stuff

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
than i than i'm gonna do probably so uh

195
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,240
in the future if you're like oh snap

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
that talk helped me or whatever let me

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
always like to get that feedback if i'm

199
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,360
hitting on the right thing

200
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
i think this is going to be pretty

201
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,319
pretty cool so you're going to hopefully

202
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
some people learn something new and my

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
my thing is if i learn one thing that i

204
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,319

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
that too like marcus you should have

208
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,280
just kept that in the can

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,559
all right cool let's go

210
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,400
all right i heard this announcement

211
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,239
today facebook changed its name to meta

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,759
yeah facebook changed this name to meta

213
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
now the things that we talked about

214
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
blockchain and all that stuff so this is

215
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
mark zuckerberg announced this today

216
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
this is not a joke this is serious

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
so basically uh facebook changed their

218
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
name

219
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
and they're saying hey what we're trying

220
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
to do is focus on this metaverse

221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
now the metaverse contains a lot of

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
stuff mainly uh most people would say

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
that ar vr all this other stuff you know

224
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
they bought oculus they've dabbled

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
around in cryptocurrency

226
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
uh uh d5 decentralized finance

227
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
uh cryptocurrency um

228
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
nfts is a big part right now in the

229
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
metaverse so all this stuff is a part of

230
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
this metaverse and so facebook is like

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
look we're going to own this space

232
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,479
mark zuckerberg said we're going to own

233
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,879
this metaverse now if you actually go to

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
facebook.com or or you can just search

235
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
meta if you don't believe me

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
he changed the name today and he's like

237
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
we're going to own this space

238
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
so they own meta.com

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,879
so i don't know how soon this transition

240
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,039
is going to happen but what facebook

241
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,199
said is like all the people that are are

242
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,759
using uh our platform

243
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,479
or

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,399
is an older generation and they're

245
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,679
trying to model they're trying to

246
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
modernize and they're trying to embrace

247
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
this decentralization

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,039
so

249
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,159
this right now this is a big day and

250
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
remember this day

251
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
for the next couple years because i

252
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
think that what's going to happen is

253
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
everybody else is going to follow suit

254
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
quickly

255
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
so everybody you probably work for a

256
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
company that's dabbling around in this i

257
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
know that we have a lot of gaming

258
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
companies have a lot of high-tech

259
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,080
companies this whole metaverse thing is

260
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,160
here to stay and we we have to

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
understand

262
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
uh some of these things and hopefully if

263
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,440
you don't know before hopefully i'll

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
give you some tools to to research

265
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
so actually i'm changing an eminence to

266
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
hager's guide to the metaverse

267
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
so that's where we're going to talk

268
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
about this real quick the metaverse

269
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
means something different to her body

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
too by the way it's not there's not one

271
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
metaverse it's like the internet there's

272
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,080
a bunch of metaverses

273
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
you know here are metaphors they're

274
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,279
a there's a lot of different kind of

277
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,839
meta verses this right here anybody read

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,720
all right so this book right here is i

305
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
mean this this is a 80 something page

306
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,880
guide and it walks through uh everything

307
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,200
so it talks about bitcoin bitcoin of

308
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
course is the first

309
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
pretty much the first

310
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
uh publicly used cryptocurrency but i've

311
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
found research

312
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
that cryptocurrencies i found newspaper

313
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
articles back in the 80s talking about

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,920
cryptocurrencies

315
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
the first time i saw cryptocurrency

316
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
written in the newspaper it was uh

317
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
talking about a

318
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
they were trying to do a european

319
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
standard cryptocurrency so they could so

320
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
in europe this is before the euro

321
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
so the euro is the is kind of like the

322
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
pr the what came out of all that

323
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,079
discussion

324
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
it's like a centralized little currency

325
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
but they didn't make it into a

326
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
cryptocurrency

327
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
so so from what i read myself and this

328
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
is way back when john major was the

329
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
prime minister of the uk

330
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
and i and it's pretty interesting uh so

331
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
is this this thing called newspapers.com

332
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,200
i actually do crazy like i mean some of

333
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
y'all sent people

334
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
will probably use that before too

335
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
newspaper.com i'm like like when's the

336
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
first time people talk about

337
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
cryptocurrency and and i found it like

338
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
it was in the 80s when john major was

339
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,480
prime minister

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,320
this paper right here is so freaking

341
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
dope and it's going to get you up to

342
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
speed and it's going to send you down

343
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,959
the rabbit hole that i've been

344
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
all right so distributed ledger

345
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
technology is like the proper name for

346
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
it uh and i think black blockchain and

347
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
distributed ledger technology is the

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
same thing would anybody agree i got

349
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
blockchain expert is that okay that's

350
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
okay i'm not messing up yet so far tell

351
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
me you can raise your hand say marcus

352
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,959
that's not right and you can correct me

353
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,120
so we can get everybody on the same page

354
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
all right so this is the same so dlt

355
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
distributed ledger technology

356
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
so basically you have these ledgers that

357
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,279
are

358
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
are replicated all over the world

359
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
uh they're they're

360
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,240
people call them miners and those miners

361
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,399
they actually make money to participate

362
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,360
in this distributed uh network there's

363
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,200
nodes all over the place some of y'all

364
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
might have your own crypto miners

365
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
they are taking part and so

366
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
those miners have a copy of the ledger

367
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,440
so it's like a big database and

368
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
everybody has a copy of it

369
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
and everybody replicates and everybody

370
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
agrees that

371
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,399
the data is the data

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,959
now in cyber security the term that we

373
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
use for that is uh

374
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
we there's two terms that we could use

375
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
for that uh

376
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
the the distributed network and ledger

377
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
make sure that there's integrity of all

378
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
the data

379
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
right

380
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
and it also makes sure that there's

381
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
there's non-repudiation

382
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,079
the non-repudiation means if a

383
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,399
transaction happened that transaction is

384
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
distributed through all the network

385
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
funny enough blockchain uh has been

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
existed in cryptography forever

387
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,279
uh well not forever but a long long time

388
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,839
when i was uh i'm 46 now and i feel like

389
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,839
i'm getting old um

390
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,199
but even back then we in cryptography

391
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,880
in many of the algorithms i used when i

392
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,360
was in the military they had blockchain

393
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,480
so blockchain is similar to a crc a

394
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,199
cyclical redundancy check where

395
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,760
it's it's like something spills over to

396
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
the next sector to

397
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
and if you mess up any of those segments

398
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,079
everything is is is uh goes bad so you

399
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,320
can't it's supposed to be tamper proof

400
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
and and we like we use the terms

401
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
integrity and all that stuff am i doing

402
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,320
okay so far

403
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
uh blockchain people

404
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,959
all right cool sweet awesome i feel like

405
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,720
i did my homework for the first time

406
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,279
ever in my life

407
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,839
so in cybersecurity we talk a lot about

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480
the cia triad uh there's actually a

409
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,279
triad related to blockchain

410
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
and they call it a trilemma

411
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
but let's talk about this first

412
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,839
all right and read this read that paper

413
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
it'll tell you about the trilemma

414
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
there's governance security and our

415
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
scalability that's the trilemma how do

416
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,800
we keep it secure how do we govern this

417
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
this digital technology like how do we

418
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
govern bitcoin how do we govern ethereum

419
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
all that and how do we make sure it's

420
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
secure right and how does this scale

421
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,199
those that's the trilemma there's three

422
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,839
things that every crypto community

423
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,360
worries about

424
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
all right so the cia triad is something

425
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
cyber security we worry about so

426
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,839
one of the things that people say all

427
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,839
the time is like hey

428
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,160
we you know

429
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,560
the blockchain is like every like the

430
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
they're public and there's private

431
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
blockchains anybody can have a

432
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
blockchain everything's pretty much open

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
source too by the way and and that's

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,279
cool because people can poke holes

435
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,480
through it right

436
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,199
but

437
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
in the public blockchain like where

438
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,800
people are changing money you can

439
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,399
actually look at the ledgers you can

440
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
actually look and see how much money if

441
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,759
you know somebody's address you can

442
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
actually see how much money they have

443
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,320
uh in in currency you can look at a

444
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,519
wildlife address and you can see

445
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,800
everything in it

446
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
now that kind of spooked me out at first

447
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,639
like that's that's kind of crazy

448
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
i got to take my glasses off i started

449
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,920
wearing glasses too folks i'm getting

450
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
old

451
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
let me put these right here

452
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
that that thing is like killing me uh

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,720
the lights on my glasses

454
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
it's probably shining back into y'all

455
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
face too probably i don't know

456
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,399
all right cool so i can see enough to

457
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,040
push the next button though

458
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,519
all right so the cia triad is something

459
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,040
that we talk about confidentiality

460
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
integrity and availability we talk about

461
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
it all the time let's break it down

462
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
because this actually kind of freaked me

463
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,680
out and a lot of people probably it'll

464
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
probably freak people out too because

465
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,839
like definitely when it comes to nfts

466
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
people or people have a lot of

467
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
complaints about that and how confident

468
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
you are and so what i'm going to do is

469
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,839
i'm going to hopefully have some time

470
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,680
for questions too so y'all can tell me

471
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
how crazy and stupid this this whole

472
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,040
talk was i'm going to save some time for

473
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
that too

474
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
so confidentiality so if it's a public

475
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,079
blockchain most of the stuff you put out

476
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,880
there

477
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,920
is is for public information there's

478
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
people trying to do some tokens now

479
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
where they're embedding tokens in a

480
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,839
blockchain and you need some kind of

481
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,959
private pki situation so they're trying

482
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,120
to do there's methods that people are

483
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,360
playing around with that you can encrypt

484
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
stuff on the blockchain

485
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,880
they're in nfts there's this thing

486
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,279
called unlockable content so if i buy if

487
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,000
i buy nft so if i bought nft of a

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,400
conference like if i said hey

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
last con last con might do nfts in the

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
future by the way they're going to last

491
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,199
con seller nft and unlockable content

492
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,000
would be your your uh program guide here

493
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,199
right

494
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
and uh and so what's cool about the nfts

495
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,240
is that that they're on the blockchain

496
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
and you can use this and there's this

497
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,679
thing called etherscan that you can

498
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
check out uh etherscan is a good tool

499
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,240
etherscan.io i believe is the domain

500
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
you can actually go to that domain and

501
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
you can look at you can scan wallets and

502
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
you can see what's in wallets you can

503
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
also scan smart contracts and look at

504
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
smart contracts

505
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,280
um smart contracts are freaking dope too

506
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
by the way i thought all this stuff was

507
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
fun i thought all this stuff was a joke

508
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
and not going anywhere too by my i was

509
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,280
the ultimate skeptic of this stuff

510
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
but now i'm kind of converted like wow

511
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
this is pretty dope and and there's way

512
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,360
more applications than just uh you know

513
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,799
dogecoin or or whatever sheba the one

514
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
that's hot right now there's a lot more

515
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,120
applications in this stuff and hopefully

516
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
you're going to see the security

517
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,840
applications and we got to help secure

518
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
this too so you're going to think of say

519
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
oh snap i can use this for that and

520
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,520
you're going to say oh how do we secure

521
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
that

522
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
so confidentiality i

523
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
i think confidentiality is kind of like

524
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
a reach right now as far as blockchain

525
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,160
goes

526
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
uh and i've seen companies

527
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
i've seen startups say we have this

528
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,720
blockchain technology that keeps your

529
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
data uh you know secure

530
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,240
and like confidence confidential i'm

531
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,520
like how you know i don't even

532
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,600
understand it sometimes but what people

533
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,320
do

534
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,919
what happened is

535
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,440
and it's the same thing with ai and ml

536
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
people would say

537
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,080
people would take some kind of

538
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,640
technology and then they'll they'll say

539
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
we're we're blockchain company that does

540
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
this where ai company does this and a

541
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
lot of times it's total bullcrap all

542
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,679
right

543
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,799
for sure y'all seen that right

544
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,240
all right so confidentiality i think

545
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,679
it's far-fetched because because these

546
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
public blockchains everything's public

547
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
and you can pretty much see what's in in

548
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,520
every wallet pretty much

549
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,280
integrity of the data this is super

550
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,039
important because integrity and

551
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
non-repudiation goes hand in hand and i

552
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
do like the whole thing about blockchain

553
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,880
as far as

554
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
100 like it's pretty dang good for

555
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,160
non-repudiation and integrity of data

556
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,520
and that's why uh financial institutions

557
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
any kind of transactional kind of places

558
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
are definitely 100 percent going to be

559
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
using this and

560
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
100

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
is going to be everywhere

562
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,280
100

563
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,039
without a doubt is going to be every

564
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,440
bank it's going to be in every

565
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,559
you know uh

566
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
nationalized banking system central

567
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,960
banking everybody is going to be using

568
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
blockchain for the non-repudiation

569
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,840
i'm confident of that and i think that

570
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
there's even legal there's going to be

571
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,919
some legal requirements that force

572
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,000
everybody to do blockchain technology in

573
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
the future

574
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
like when we talk about legal when we

575
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,320
talk about going in and doing like uh

576
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,039
uh you know what like search warrants

577
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,440
and god the e-discovery and all this and

578
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,280
stuff like that there's definitely going

579
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
to be a blockchain component to that

580
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
right from the integrity of the data

581
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,320
perspective

582
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
and then availability of the data you

583
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
want to make sure that the data is

584
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
available funny enough some of these

585
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,880
transactions especially on ethereum it

586
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
costs money to write to the blockchain

587
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
so sometimes you want to do a

588
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
transaction but there's this thing

589
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,799
called a gas fee the gas fee is how much

590
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,280
it would cost you to do that transaction

591
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
sometimes you can actually try to do a

592
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,000
transaction that costs more

593
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,720
than the value of what it's worth

594
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
it's crazy so i i can say hey i want to

595
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,559
send you five dollars

596
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
but sometimes the gas feed could be high

597
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
because the network is saturated

598
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
sending you five dollars could cost me

599
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
20.

600
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
it's the craziest thing it's called gas

601
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
fees check it out

602
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
and that's that's weird and the ethereum

603
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,919
network is working on that so the gas

604
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,679
fees aren't so high

605
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,760
so that's why you have these other uh

606
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,720
that's why you have a lot of

607
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
transactions on other uh other networks

608
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
as well

609
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,080
so gas feed is a big thing i don't have

610
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,640
a gas piece slide but gas fees are how

611
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,559
much does it cost me to do a transaction

612
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
it's just like when i go to atm over

613
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
here or whatever at walmart and it

614
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
charges me five bucks to use their atm

615
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
but the gas fee sometimes can be

616
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,720
astronomical it can be like 200

617
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
to do a transaction

618
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
on ethereum sometimes or

619
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,120
four thousand dollars i mean it depends

620
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,039
on when you do it it's crazy

621
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,880
but you want to you would people just

622
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,480
wait till the gas feed calms down

623
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,000
because you can see what the current gas

624
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,360
fee is and you can do a transaction

625
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,640
so even though

626
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,480
sometimes you want a transact the reason

627
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
why this is important sometimes you want

628
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
to do a transaction and you maybe you

629
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,480
can't afford to do it so that that funds

630
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
in that situation you can't move the

631
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,600
trend sometimes you'll have enough money

632
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,760
in your wallet to move stuff

633
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
so things sometimes won't be available

634
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,080
um

635
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,840
and also like you want to make sure the

636
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,559
funds are available uh as well i mean it

637
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,919
i think there's some availability

638
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,760
playing blockchain too so here's some

639
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
use cases right i think most receipts

640
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,600
will be on the blockchain

641
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,799
you know if you get a receipt from

642
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,720
somewhere like because people do fake

643
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,799
receipts right you know people do that

644
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,280
all the time people go to go to a fancy

645
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,559
place

646
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,200
you know they go to a wedding right

647
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
then they like want to bring it back oh

648
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
i lost the receipt but they do it like a

649
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
year later or something you know people

650
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,880
do stuff like that all the time so we

651
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,960
can see like there's a bunch of use

652
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
cases for implementing blockchain uh for

653
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,280
receipts

654
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,559
let's talk about smart contracts for a

655
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
little bit because this right here this

656
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,320
blew my mind when i kind of fully

657
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,600
understood what a smart contract was

658
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
right so

659
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
smart contracts are is code written and

660
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
stored on the blockchain

661
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,080
so you write code on your machine

662
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,640
uh and and i'm gonna give solidity first

663
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
there's a program links called solidity

664
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,520
where you can write smart contracts in

665
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,120
and you can store that that smart

666
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,039
contract

667
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,200
on the blockchain

668
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,799
and people can run

669
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960
code against that against that uh

670
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,320
against that

671
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,320
forever

672
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,760
so

673
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
if we wanted to i mean a simple

674
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
application this would be

675
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,559
um

676
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,799
i want i want to build something

677
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,200
that uh is a poor man's copyright or

678
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
something like that you know poor man's

679
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
copyright when i want to say i did

680
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,080
something on this date i would mail a

681
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,840
copy that to myself

682
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
right something like that

683
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,559
so we can create a smart contract

684
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,840
that we upload data to a what we call a

685
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
dap they call it a distributed

686
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
application it's called a dap dapp

687
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,279
you're going to be doing uh

688
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,600
vulnerability stuff on these apps

689
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
right

690
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,039
and the the network they call it the web

691
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
3 network is what they call it web 2.0

692
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
is what we're on now they're calling all

693
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,919
this new stuff web3

694
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,360
however it's just like a stripe

695
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
integration though to be honest with you

696
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
that's how i compare it web 3 is like a

697
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,559
stripe integration there's a web 3js is

698
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,400
a popular library that people use right

699
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,600
now to do to their building apps in the

700
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,720
web 3 what it does is it interacts just

701
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,000
like a stripe integration that's the

702
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,760
best way i can describe it

703
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,159
so web3 actually can do transactions on

704
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
all the different blockchains

705
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,200
is it okay so far my blockchain

706
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,679
enthusiast i'm doing okay

707
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,159
all right cool so

708
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,760
web 3 is is is this metaverse a space

709
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
and this is how we transact on that

710
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
right and what a smart contract i would

711
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,640
i would write a smart contract and put

712
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,559
it on the ethereum network compile it

713
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,120
put it there and i can create a dap a

714
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,559
distributed app

715
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,039
that uses web3 and it would actually it

716
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,480
can write that

717
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,440
to a

718
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
uh persistent file share

719
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,240
that is is is uh and the thing about the

720
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,960
the whole web 3 thing is that we we

721
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,760
write stuff forever um so we write stuff

722
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
on a file share that does not ever go

723
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
away there's a couple of different uh

724
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
things there's this thing called ipfs

725
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
ipfs

726
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
you can write these files up there and

727
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
you and it will put it on the blockchain

728
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
that this file was written on this date

729
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,640
now what's really cool about this

730
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,159
is that we can charge money for that

731
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,159
service

732
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,440
right

733
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,840
and what's crazy about it is that this

734
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,279
smart contract

735
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
can work to infinity

736
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,240
so that means i write a smart contract

737
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,000
right now

738
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,840
put it into blockchain

739
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
and people can do transactions and i can

740
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
get paid in a cryptocurrency forever

741
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,520
so i get paid for it when i go away

742
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
i leave that to my kids

743
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,760
they get money from this thing so this

744
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,200
is a way to work forever and make money

745
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,039
forever

746
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,880
and it's totally decentralized it

747
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
doesn't go to the middleman

748
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
or middle woman or whatever

749
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,159
it just comes to your wallet

750
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
now that right there tripped me out i'm

751
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
like holy crap are you kidding me

752
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
and then you can write smart contracts

753
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,360
to do more stuff

754
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,440
here's the deal so whatever company you

755
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,600
work for there's going to be a reason

756
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,960
why that they want to do a smart

757
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
contract

758
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,840
and also there's going to be a reason

759
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,640
why

760
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
that companies will want to get paid in

761
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,679
cryptocurrency in the future

762
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,880
why would they want to get paid in

763
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,039
cryptocurrency marcus

764
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,200
if you look at it

765
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
the some of these cryptocurrencies are

766
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
skyrocketing solana right is brand new

767
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
it's like 150 bucks right now

768
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,159
it's predicted to be worth a thousand

769
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,400
bucks so if i'm a company

770
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,720
and i can get that you see uh what what

771
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,360
tesla announced like a year or so ago i

772
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,679
think they they kind it's kind of

773
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,360
kind of middle ground now where they

774
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,200
said hey we'll you can buy tesla and

775
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,679
bitcoin

776
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
tesla gets that money that bitcoin

777
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
appreciates they're making money just by

778
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,120
holding the currency

779
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
so i think that all companies are going

780
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
to whole crypto in the future

781
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
why not why wouldn't you do that it's

782
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,320
why would you put your money in a bank

783
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
when you can do that

784
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
you're going to have to have money right

785
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
but you're definitely going to every

786
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,679
company if whatever company you work for

787
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
you're going to be taking crypto and

788
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,159
you're going to have to learn how to

789
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,159
protect crypto and you're going to learn

790
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
how to audit these smart contracts

791
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
because what developers are doing

792
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,799
uh

793
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,799
office space uh y'all run that movie

794
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,559
office space where the developer was

795
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,919
siphoning off money until you know

796
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
that's happening right now in the crypto

797
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,600
space

798
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
there's people there's developers that

799
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,200
are developing stuff and they're writing

800
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,799
code to dump a little bit in their

801
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,559
wallet too

802
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,520
that's happening right now

803
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
so you're going to have to be able to

804
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,360
audit the code you can also reverse the

805
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
code too

806
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,919
you can actually look at the code that's

807
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,640
on on a while you can look in a code up

808
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,440
there and you can reverse it as well

809
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
solidity is the language that that is

810
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
written in for ethereum ethereum was the

811
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
first one that supported the smart

812
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,279
contracts so as we say today

813
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,200
bitcoin has some scripting that you can

814
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
do with bitcoin but but ethereum is the

815
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,120
leader in

816
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
in the innovator per se

817
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
in the space but everybody that builds

818
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
on top of ethereum can write smart

819
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
contracts too

820
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
so you gotta get on the smart you gotta

821
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,279
understand what what this technology is

822
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,880
and also it's a great way to leave

823
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,279
something for your kids too i mean i

824
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,880
mean who wouldn't want to you know and

825
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,320
also like with some of these things when

826
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,600
i when i get into nfts the nfts can give

827
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,799
royalties forever

828
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,480
you can you can do something now and

829
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,559
it's going to make royalties so our

830
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,480
artists in the past and this is go for

831
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,799
all creatives all people to do ip that

832
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,039
means all the companies you work for

833
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,200
that company is going to be able to to

834
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
release something

835
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,159
and then they're going to get paid

836
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,120
forever

837
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
so it makes everything have some kind of

838
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,200
crazy value that never never happened

839
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,440
before

840
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
there's a thing called an abi so right

841
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,520
now we're always testing apis and all

842
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,080
that stuff so on a smart contract

843
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
there's a concept called a uh it's a

844
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,320
it's an api really it's it stands for

845
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,159
application business interface is that

846
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,120
right am i right people anybody okay i

847
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,279
think that's right so like i said i

848
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,880
might say some term this is all bleeding

849
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
edge i'm just i'm drinking from i'm

850
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,559
drinking from the freaking fire hose and

851
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,120
i'm trying to give y'all as much water

852
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,080
as i can on the other side you feel me

853
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,919
so abi

854
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,840
that means that it's a smart con it's a

855
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
smart contract i put the smart contract

856
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
on the

857
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,559
uh on the blockchain and then i can make

858
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,039
function calls in another program

859
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,360
that's what you use web3 for i make

860
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,880
function calls to interact with that

861
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,159
so now

862
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
that i can the abi is the api to inter

863
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
interface with the blockchain

864
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,559
applications right

865
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,080
you all need to know how to do that

866
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,159
because you're going to be

867
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,559
there's bots out there right now

868
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,679
that they scan all these abis

869
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
and they try to find vulnerabilities or

870
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,520
misconfigurations

871
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
and they try to do something nefarious

872
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,120
with them

873
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
that's happening right now

874
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,919
and

875
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,039
these people were making millions of

876
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,799
dollars doing this by the way this is

877
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,600
like a gold rush for criminals right now

878
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,679
it's insane

879
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,720
so read up on this that the the that

880
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,679
original pdf that i showed y'all read it

881
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
tonight tomorrow something like that

882
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,919
solidity solidity is pretty interesting

883
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,320
solidity is a programming language uh

884
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,880
for ethereum uh blockchain uh smart

885
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,720
contract development uh so so check read

886
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,440
up maybe maybe read up on that it's not

887
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,600
super hard most of these applications

888
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,840
most of these smart contracts have three

889
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,600
or four functions

890
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
so it would be relatively easy to audit

891
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,960
them

892
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,440
but people go wrong all the time for

893
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,279
instance like

894
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,880
there's people that try to sell tickets

895
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
or something online right and they do a

896
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,799
smart contract for that this is

897
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,320
happening every day

898
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,480
you do a smart contract you put it up on

899
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,159
the blockchain

900
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,720
and you forgot to put a limit on how

901
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,600
many

902
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,640
tickets somebody could buy so now you

903
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,799
got some hacker that writes a script

904
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,600
that

905
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
you know it could be something like a

906
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
who's popular now i don't even know

907
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,039
i mean i'm so old now i don't know

908
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,960
your favorite entertainer

909
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,880
has a concert

910
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,200
you know 10 000 tickets for sale

911
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,120
and because you didn't rate limit on the

912
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
smart contract

913
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
all the tickets are gone and now this

914
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,799
dude is selling them on a secondary

915
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,039
market

916
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,440
that's happening every day

917
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,200
and when when your company starts trying

918
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,919
to sell tickets online or whatever using

919
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,360
smart contracts and blockchain all that

920
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,880
stuff you want to make sure you take

921
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,799
that into account you need to understand

922
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,080
oh solidity has a has a you can easily

923
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
extract the you know the the sender and

924
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,720
all that you can actually store you can

925
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
persist data

926
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,640
in in as objects

927
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,399
in the blockchain

928
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,120
so it has state and memory and all that

929
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,440
stuff it's crazy

930
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,679
i mean it's it's nuts but you have to

931
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,320
understand it in order to help help with

932
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,039
it am i making sense so far

933
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,880
hopefully um hopefully i'm not talking

934
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,880
crazy

935
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
it runs on everybody that's part of the

936
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
network computer like the whole remember

937
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,080
i said the blockchain is everybody's the

938
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,240
all these nodes all these nodes have a

939
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
copy of all the transactions and they

940
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
have a copy of the code

941
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
the smart contract code

942
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,919
it can be hosted anywhere you're right

943
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
yeah but but like back in the day when

944
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,279
we thought our friends were stupid for

945
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
doing crypto mining that's what they

946
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,880
were doing

947
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,640
and they were getting and now now we

948
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
look i look stupid i'm like god dang

949
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,279
this dude is a millionaire of bitcoin i

950
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,640
look crazy now

951
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,480
but yeah so the question was let me

952
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,240
repeat the question the question was is

953
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
this happening amazon is happening

954
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
whatever

955
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
wherever a minor exists on some of these

956
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
networks that's where the transaction

957
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,360
happens so what happens is

958
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
if i if i try to do a transaction it

959
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
sends it up

960
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,360
one of the miners it sends it up to them

961
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
the first one that comes back with the

962
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,559
answer

963
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,559
gets paid

964
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,440
right

965
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
and that's kind of how it works

966
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,600
so in the what the mining is doing is

967
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,279
it there's nonsense and there's like a

968
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,600
lot of technical other stuff but it's

969
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960
just basically

970
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,399
it's just

971
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,919
the whole network makes sure that the

972
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,440
data has integrity that's what it does

973
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,200
and so what's cool about that is that

974
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
there's a lot of people that you know

975
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
some of my friends they had graphic

976
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,918
cards they was doing all this mining

977
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,359
they made a lot they're making a lot of

978
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,639
money

979
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,159
um

980
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,839
rust is another language rust is super

981
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,119
popular right now

982
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,359
i never gave russ a second look i like

983
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,679
golang personally but a lot of people a

984
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,440
lot of my friends are doing rust rust is

985
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
actually one of the languages that's

986
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,239
pretty handy because uh

987
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,960
it's uh on solana you can write a smart

988
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,359
contract in rust

989
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,520
rust is a pretty proper language

990
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,599
solidity is a custom language written

991
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,560
for the ethereum network

992
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,159
what's cool about this you can write

993
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,199
this code in a browser

994
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,520
ethereum has a it's like code you just

995
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,359
write it compile it and then you can

996
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,199
deploy it to the blockchain all in the

997
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,520
browser

998
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,320
so on a chromebook you know you need

999
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
on this stuff you can have a chromebook

1000
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
and totally work

1001
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
you don't need no honking machines no

1002
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,640
crazy stuff like that

1003
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
and you can you can write smart

1004
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,920
contracts and and get paid

1005
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
and people are dying for these

1006
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,839
developers right now too by the way

1007
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,320
if you're a coder i would be on i would

1008
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,000
be on some solidity and i would be on

1009
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,680
some rest and i will understand how to

1010
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,440
write smart contracts

1011
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,119
because it's easy though it's easy money

1012
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,760
it's easy money

1013
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
thing is that a dupe

1014
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,880
all right let's talk a little bit about

1015
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
this non-fungible tokens uh

1016
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,040
the non-fungible token thing is kind of

1017
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
hilarious because there's people selling

1018
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
these these jpegs for two hundred

1019
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,320
thousand dollars and such

1020
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
there's one dude that's old he did jpegs

1021
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,960
for a year or something and he sold it

1022
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,800
for like 18 million dollars or something

1023
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
crazy like that recently

1024
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
that's insane

1025
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
but uh i don't get caught up on the art

1026
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
i just caught up i just get like okay

1027
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
cool what's the practical application of

1028
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
that right

1029
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,799
you remember this

1030
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,160
this is the fake the fake id thing right

1031
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,839
so

1032
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,000
in the future i believe that all our all

1033
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
our identifications all the credit cards

1034
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,200
all the these things will be written

1035
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,480
i think there's gonna they're gonna be

1036
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
versions of nfts we call them nfts now

1037
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,119
and we probably still call them nft nft

1038
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,680
has another name called a deed uh

1039
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,560
and and in practical life uh a deed an

1040
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,160
nft and a deed is the same thing on the

1041
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
blockchain

1042
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
so

1043
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,480
how this is gonna work is that

1044
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,560
everything that that every piece of

1045
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,800
identification insurance card anything

1046
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,480
like that uh

1047
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,320
like if you try to show a cop a fake

1048
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
insurance card or something like that a

1049
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,520
cop is going to be able to scan it he's

1050
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,160
going to be able to go to usa or geico's

1051
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,200
and it's going to be like oh is this

1052
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,480
real or not it's going to be like

1053
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
instantaneous

1054
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,520
boom

1055
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,359
like and like it's going to when the

1056
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,880
insurance was done

1057
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,599
i got into accident a while ago

1058
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,680
and the guy that i had a wreck with was

1059
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,440
trying to get insurance before the cop

1060
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,960
came he was on the phone through an

1061
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,480
insurance provider trying to get

1062
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,200
insurance like right then and there

1063
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,119
he didn't he hit me didn't have

1064
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,520
insurance

1065
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,400
however in the future

1066
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,240
the insurance company like okay what

1067
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,839
time did this happen

1068
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
and this is exactly so it's going to be

1069
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
like time everything's going to be times

1070
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,119
time it's like a freaking log you know

1071
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,000
and it's going to be for good or bad

1072
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,880
now one thing uh as far as forensic goes

1073
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,560
i'm an ex digital forensic i used to do

1074
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
a lot of forensics i teach forensics to

1075
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,839
law

1076
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,800
enforcement uh

1077
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
yeah so that's why i believe that some

1078
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
of the things you do in your day-to-day

1079
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,240
job as a security professional logs and

1080
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,200
stuff

1081
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,400
that's going to be written to some kind

1082
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,160
of blockchain somewhere and it's going

1083
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,040
to be

1084
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,839
be able to be submitted in court uh

1085
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,000
better than somebody is making up logs

1086
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
you know or ignoring logs or whatever

1087
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,599
they do

1088
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,119
i think that's what i say there's a

1089
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,440
blockchain little sliver for a lot of

1090
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,680
stuff

1091
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,599
disney

1092
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,000
this is big all right so big brands are

1093
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,960
gonna be doing non-fungible tokens

1094
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,720
uh just like they have little trinkets

1095
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,079
when you go to mcdonald's and all this

1096
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,200
other stuff

1097
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
there's gonna be there's gonna be nfts

1098
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
for everything that you that

1099
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
especially big brands like disney

1100
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
there's going to be nft for everything

1101
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
they're going to move you come out i

1102
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,920
believe you're going to buy you're going

1103
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
to be able to buy a script from from

1104
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,560
from collection memorabilia purposes

1105
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,000
you're going to be able to do anything

1106
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,520
and you're going to have that absolute

1107
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,400
ownership

1108
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
what what what people like about nfts is

1109
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
it's a digital contract that says i own

1110
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,720
that asset

1111
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
now there may be you know uh one of my

1112
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,920
favorite movies full metal jacket uh

1113
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,760
this is my rifle there are many like

1114
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,400
this but this one is mine

1115
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,200
with nft you actually own you you can

1116
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,359
actually own it and it's a it's a mind

1117
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,119
bender but

1118
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
it's true

1119
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,800
and it doesn't matter what we think

1120
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,040
the truth is that there's people out

1121
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,880
there that believe it and they pay for

1122
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,920
it

1123
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,040
right

1124
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,200
because it's in the eye of the beholder

1125
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
you know

1126
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,359
and

1127
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,520
and other people believe it has value so

1128
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,280
it's here to stay

1129
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
some of this stuff we see is not going

1130
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,520
to be existent but people like disney

1131
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
people like marvel i'm a big marvel fan

1132
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,160
if y'all know me i got i got a i got a

1133
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,520
killer marvel collection i can't lie

1134
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,520
marvel comes out new movie boom boom

1135
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
boom you're gonna have people that that

1136
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
uh

1137
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,440
uh

1138
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,040
people on the screen pay people and do

1139
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
this and people like crazy people like

1140
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,440
me will pay for that stuff

1141
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,119
and i will have it it will be on the

1142
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,160
blockchain that marcus owns that

1143
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,880
and what's crazy about these nfts if you

1144
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,760
sell it you can get royalties as well

1145
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,920
so something like disney or marvel they

1146
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
sell stuff and they can get they can get

1147
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,839
paid every time it flips

1148
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,240
a percentage so if disney releases some

1149
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
kind of nft

1150
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,440
it sells for

1151
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,040
it sells for you know a million dollars

1152
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,200
or whatever they get they can get 10 of

1153
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,240
that

1154
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,079
so every time it's resold they get paid

1155
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,680
too so that's why companies are going to

1156
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,880
be doing this

1157
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
you're going to get companies and brands

1158
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,480
that sell concert tickets and every time

1159
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,480
that concert ticket is resold in a

1160
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,160
secondary market they're going to get

1161
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,200
paid on that again

1162
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,599
that's what the reality is is and it's

1163
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,240
not about if it makes sense or not what

1164
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
makes money is what people and companies

1165
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,399
do

1166
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
definitely going to happen 100

1167
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,480
so let's talk about some attacks so

1168
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,119
quantum computing is a is kind of attack

1169
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,400
i'm going to talk about

1170
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,000
this will make more sense after i talk

1171
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
about the wallets probably so this might

1172
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,240
be misplaced but quantum computing the

1173
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
whole thing about that is

1174
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,359
that a quantum computer supposedly

1175
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,960
and this might happen in the future but

1176
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
i'm mad skeptical i can't lie i'm a

1177
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,280
skeptic

1178
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,000
so some some person will say well

1179
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,680
quantum computing will be able to look

1180
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,599
at all the private keys on the

1181
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,640
blockchain and be able to do

1182
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,960
know all the i mean know all the public

1183
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,400
keys we can we can look at the public

1184
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,560
keys and we're going to be able to

1185
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,480
reverse those and if you have the if you

1186
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,079
have those private keys if you have

1187
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,920
everybody private key you can extract

1188
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,760
all their bitcoin

1189
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,640
or you can strike all the ethereum

1190
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,560
that's the that's the attack

1191
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,880
that people are worried about but what's

1192
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
cool though remember that trilemma that

1193
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,839
i talked about earlier and it's going to

1194
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,520
talk about in the book the governance

1195
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
piece

1196
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
they do find vulnerabilities in these

1197
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,160
blockchains but they do update they do

1198
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
updates it's open source hey this is a

1199
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,400
weakness here all right here's the new

1200
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,200
standard like rfps that's yin-yang they

1201
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
don't call them they don't call them

1202
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
rfps but they're essentially rp's so

1203
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
these communities they have mad papers

1204
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,880
that you can read for free

1205
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
and you can just read the standards

1206
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,400
the actual nft token is a is an art

1207
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,960
there was a there's a paper for that

1208
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,720
there's a paper bitcoin there's a paper

1209
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,119
for ethereum all this stuff is public

1210
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,400
and you can read about it and be an

1211
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,720
expert at it somebody in here is going

1212
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,359
to be a total expert at stuff and you're

1213
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,880
going to be way ahead of everybody else

1214
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,119
if you don't get on now i think that in

1215
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,800
the next year if you understand this

1216
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,839
stuff you're you're going to be so much

1217
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,760
ahead of everybody else i think it's

1218
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,599
that serious

1219
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
there's a lot of fishing going on so i'm

1220
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,520
going to i'm going to look at a wallet

1221
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,359
tons of fishing going on

1222
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,359
and these are the platforms that most of

1223
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,040
this activity is happening on right now

1224
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,800
the crypto stuff

1225
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,280
uh is happening heavy on on there's

1226
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,960
crypto a little

1227
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,079
man mad mad mad russians on this bad

1228
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,359
like

1229
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,520
all this this underground is going on on

1230
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,040
on

1231
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,240
so if you don't you're not a part of

1232
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,839
these communities you can actually get

1233
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,760
in some of these things and there's mad

1234
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640
speculation from a financial perspective

1235
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
crazy amount of speculation

1236
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,760
um

1237
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,680
twitter um

1238
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
and i'll explain how twitter has a link

1239
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,480
too because the in the nft space twitter

1240
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
is one of the main conduits to advertise

1241
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
nfts so there's fake there's fake

1242
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,880
twitter accounts popping up and they're

1243
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,839
making

1244
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,359
they're making millions of dollars doing

1245
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,839
this and if like that

1246
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,839
every day there's an nft collection that

1247
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,960
makes like 2.5 million dollars

1248
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,680
that's like standard now it's crazy it's

1249
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,480
happening every day

1250
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,319
all right let's talk about hot wallets

1251
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,359
all right

1252
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,640
how am i doing i'm doing good on time

1253
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
i go all right that's plenty of time i'm

1254
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
gonna i'm gonna try to wrap up and about

1255
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,760
five and then i have some questions all

1256
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
right i'll take questions

1257
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,480
all right cool so hot wallet a hot

1258
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,240
wallet is a wallet that's client like

1259
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,560
online uh there's terms like

1260
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
non-custodial versus uh custodial

1261
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,680
wallets

1262
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,839
that you'll hear but i just like talking

1263
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
about them like hot wallet co-wallet

1264
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,680
so hot wallet essentially is a wallet

1265
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,520
that you use for transactions and

1266
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,480
there's a couple of different hot

1267
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,000
wallets that are very popular i'm going

1268
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,760
to talk about the two that i deal with

1269
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
but there's there's tons of other

1270
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,000
wallets

1271
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,839
this one is the most famous wallet right

1272
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,720
here this is a this is a metamask wallet

1273
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,560
right so metamask allows you to do

1274
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,800
transactions on ethereum network

1275
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,960
and it's a chrome extension that allows

1276
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,440
you to do web3 transactions

1277
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,359
the web 3 transactions is just like

1278
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,400
stripe

1279
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,680
it's i

1280
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,000
it's a stripe integration except the

1281
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,520
integration is talking to the blockchain

1282
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,720
so this this hot this hot wallet uh

1283
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,880
this hot water allows you to exchange

1284
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,480
crypto for purchase on things

1285
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,160
right

1286
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,480
the web the web3 applications that your

1287
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
company is going to build it's coming

1288
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,280
it's coming it's coming it's coming

1289
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,720
you're going to be building web3

1290
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,240
applications and people are going to be

1291
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,440
using

1292
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,880
if it's on ethereum network because you

1293
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,040
can pick what network provider but web 3

1294
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,480
works on all the all of them though

1295
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,960
pretty much web 3 the the drivers it's a

1296
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,040
javascript library uh web3.js

1297
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,640
metamask allows you to do those

1298
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,040
transactions you go to the site you can

1299
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
in if you like what you want if you like

1300
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,680
it

1301
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,960
you can actually

1302
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,280
buy it with the metamask wallet

1303
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
so the metamask wallet um when it comes

1304
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,520
up it has this thing called a seed

1305
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,400
phrase

1306
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,319
the seed phrase is a long like a

1307
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,119
passphrase it's like 24 letters 24 words

1308
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,280
or something and it creates this huge

1309
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,280
freaking number that serves pretty much

1310
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,200
as your private key

1311
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,280
in a round by way

1312
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,119
that was a technical shortcut there you

1313
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,040
can read more about it though

1314
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
it's a freaking long pass phrase that

1315
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,800
creates a the creature private key

1316
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,760
pretty much

1317
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
that's that's kind of how it works

1318
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,040
um

1319
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
and so with that uh you you have a

1320
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
public key and

1321
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,079
and if people want to send money to you

1322
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,119
they send them

1323
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,200
they send money to your public key

1324
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,040
and you can receive it and you can spend

1325
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,720
it with the private key

1326
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,400
it's pki

1327
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
there's another one uh so this is what

1328
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,200
that that looks like um it tells you to

1329
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,440
write this down because with that with

1330
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,920
that phrase there

1331
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,440
what you can do and this is what your

1332
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,560
customers are going to be doing and what

1333
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,319
you're going to do as a consumer

1334
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,839
you're going to be able to use that to

1335
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,560
generate that private key

1336
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,480
if you ever do this do not share that

1337
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
with anybody except for your family

1338
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
probably uh most people say write it

1339
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,560
down there's people and if the

1340
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,880
co-wallets work just like this

1341
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
what people do is they take half of the

1342
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,800
half they take half of this and they put

1343
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,640
it on the engraving on a metal plate and

1344
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,240
they take the other half and grape it on

1345
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,160
a metal plate

1346
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
there's people in these metamask wallets

1347
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
it's a chrome plug-in

1348
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
people have millions of dollars on this

1349
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,240
chrome plug-in

1350
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,040
is that crazy

1351
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,079
and and if i see that if you if you show

1352
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,480
somebody this what is happening a lot of

1353
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,400
these people aren't technical law so

1354
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
these engineers are like hey yeah let's

1355
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,240
do a project together and

1356
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,839
and they'll do and i was like oh yeah

1357
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,280
cool can you do a screen share so i can

1358
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,839
see the art and as soon as they show

1359
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,599
this phrase here they'll they'll do

1360
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,200
social engineering

1361
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
to get them to reveal this this seed

1362
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,160
phrase is what we call it

1363
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,480
screen capture the seed phrase and

1364
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,400
totally drain the wallet within minutes

1365
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,000
because the seed phrase creates that

1366
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,680
private key

1367
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,680
you got the private key you put in any

1368
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,680
metamask yourself and you can transfer

1369
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,559
it to another wallet

1370
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,119
i i have a friend who helps people do

1371
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,480
incident responsiveness all the time

1372
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,559
every day somebody just lost two hundred

1373
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,720
thousand dollars somebody loves it like

1374
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,119
can you imagine that

1375
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,280
like your artist in in all your life

1376
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,640
worth you've been waiting for this

1377
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,160
moment to capitalize on this

1378
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,000
and like she talks to people and they're

1379
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,160
like i'm about to kill myself

1380
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
that's serious

1381
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,000
i was i was using this this would have

1382
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,280
paid this

1383
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,359
she talked to somebody the other day

1384
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,599
i was i just got married and i was about

1385
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,359
to buy a house

1386
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,119
with that money

1387
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,800
and then these scammers stole it from me

1388
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,640
this is craziness of the wild wild west

1389
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,359
this is the wild wild west

1390
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,599
and from a security person i'm like man

1391
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,359
there's people getting affected by this

1392
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,680
this is nuts like you know because

1393
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,440
we don't like 200 000

1394
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,280
that's a lot of money

1395
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,480
that's a lot of money to most people

1396
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,200
and there's also a phantom wallet uh

1397
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,119
i actually do a lot of stuff on

1398
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,359
a solano network phantom wallet is a

1399
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,520
very popular and really good wallet

1400
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,440
different network and all that stuff

1401
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,760
right

1402
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
then there's a cold wallet so so we're

1403
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,720
talking about hot water here

1404
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,160
another hot wallet

1405
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,400
so essentially it's in the browser

1406
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,200
so a hacker if they if they own you

1407
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,240
they can find the private key

1408
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,720
or if you insert a seed phrase they're

1409
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,480
gonna they can get that too and they can

1410
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,559
just put it in they can put it in their

1411
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,400
app and it'll generate the same private

1412
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,359
key

1413
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,200
so if you ever do transactions or if you

1414
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,680
have people say never never share your

1415
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,400
seed face never never share it that's

1416
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,599
like giving people your bank account

1417
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,240
then there's a co-wallet

1418
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,800
co-wallet is something that

1419
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,760
the the private key is stored on an

1420
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,079
alternative device

1421
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,040
so the private key is not so

1422
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,760
it's like a little shim per se

1423
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,119
and this is what a cold wallet kind of

1424
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:30,880
looks like this is a very popular cold

1425
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,359
wallet called ledger

1426
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,400
and this is what a lot of people

1427
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,839
recommend

1428
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,839
so this wallet you hook it up to your

1429
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,000
you hook it up to your usb

1430
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and it maintains the private key on

1431
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,440
the device

1432
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,520
so not even your computer knows the

1433
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
private key

1434
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,920
your your your computer can transact by

1435
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,000
using the public key to communicate with

1436
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,520
this device

1437
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,839
so your private key is secret

1438
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,559
right but the whole deal is how

1439
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,280
blockchain works is everything's public

1440
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,559
as far as what's in the wallet

1441
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,480
but people will not have your your

1442
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,400
private key so that's why everybody if

1443
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
you're doing these transactions uh if

1444
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,760
your customers in the future are doing

1445
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,359
these transactions you're gonna want

1446
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,680
them to understand cold wallets and what

1447
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,520
a cold wild it is

1448
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,880
and that's the best way to stay

1449
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,160
protected

1450
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,760
now this is kind of interesting because

1451
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,119
a lot of people will probably probably

1452
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,760
use crypto and and some people have

1453
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
millions of dollars just sitting on a

1454
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,920
computer if you have that

1455
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,599
you should you should transition to cold

1456
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,119
water most crypto people are kind of

1457
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,400
aware of this

1458
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,599
but if you're starting to get into

1459
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,280
crypto you want to get a cold wallet

1460
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,000
and from an enterprise perspective

1461
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,520
what's going to happen when you start

1462
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,240
taking crypto payments

1463
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,640
are y'all going to have a strategy on

1464
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,000
cold wallet it's your company

1465
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,920
i know somebody in here is probably

1466
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,079
already taking crypto payments

1467
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,680
but how do you handle that

1468
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,839
there's there's creative solutions that

1469
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,680
that people can share

1470
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,280
these things as well so there could be

1471
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,040
multiple people with access and all that

1472
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,520
stuff what's your cfo going to the you

1473
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,480
know what what's the cfo doing right

1474
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,640
who has custody of these wallets are you

1475
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,640
keeping them in a safe deposit box or i

1476
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,079
mean there's all kind of crazy stuff

1477
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,520
going on like i mean i can't i'm like

1478
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,640
how do you do this

1479
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,559
you know and if somebody gets the seed

1480
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,839
phrase

1481
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,599
say if you if your employee leaves the

1482
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,079
company

1483
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,559
like pulls a snowden on you

1484
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,720
and ends up in russia

1485
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,440
and that person has the seed phrase

1486
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,920
guess what

1487
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,559
that person can put that seed phrase in

1488
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,200
a device in russia

1489
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,240
and transfer all the crypto out of that

1490
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,920
because it's on the blockchain the

1491
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,640
crypto is it the the

1492
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,640
the calculations should i say the

1493
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,839
balances

1494
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,599
are actually stored on the blockchain

1495
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,640
so from a corporate situation how do we

1496
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,119
protect if our companies

1497
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,520
take crypto payments how do we protect

1498
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,759
that

1499
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,400
there's a whole lot of money from a from

1500
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,440
a

1501
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,000
protecting and if you know how to do

1502
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,640
this and you create solutions to do this

1503
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,640
and you help protect these things you're

1504
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,000
going to be super valuable as a

1505
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,119
professional

1506
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,280
so i want everybody to know this is a

1507
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,559
big problem

1508
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,079
and if you know how to solve it or you

1509
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,839
can work in it you're going to be able

1510
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:30,559
to

1511
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,480
you know you're going to be able to make

1512
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,400
it back i like people making money you

1513
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,240
know what i'm saying i want my friends

1514
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,240
and colleagues to get better jobs and

1515
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,760
and be able to you know provide for

1516
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,440
their families and all that stuff and do

1517
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,920
good stuff

1518
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,040
all right so i do so hey i want y'all to

1519
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,640
check out my art and i'm actually

1520
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,960
selling art and this is not a straight

1521
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,440
up plug i'm telling you because i'm

1522
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
actually jumping in the nf3 space and

1523
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,520
the reason why is because

1524
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,040
i want to understand what these artists

1525
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,200
are feeling like i want like okay cool

1526
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,040
they're doing this big thing

1527
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,800
they're they're launched they're they're

1528
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,319
putting their art online and they're

1529
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,880
selling it and what the process has

1530
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,559
taught me so much

1531
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,760
right

1532
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,240
just me doing this i've learned so much

1533
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,839
i've learned about these blockchains

1534
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,040
i've learned about the payments i've

1535
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,640
learned about

1536
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,960
the gas the everything everything i'm

1537
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,800
telling you right now is because i'm

1538
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,280
going through this process

1539
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,400
and that's that's crazy

1540
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,960
so you never understand

1541
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,559
you know certain kind of things till you

1542
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,960
walk a mile in in somebody's shoes

1543
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,319
that's why i encourage people if you're

1544
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,760
a security professional learn how to do

1545
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,520
learn how to do system administration

1546
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,880
learn how to do networking learn how to

1547
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,480
do all that stuff because if you

1548
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,200
understand all those things then you can

1549
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,680
be able to secure it better right

1550
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,280
i wouldn't have known anything that i'm

1551
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,960
telling you right now

1552
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,559
because what's crazy is i'm going down

1553
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,000
this thing and i keep on seeing these

1554
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
security things i'm like holy crap that

1555
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,480
that that that that and then you walk

1556
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
away we're like wow

1557
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,400
we need good people

1558
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,079
fighting this good fight and trying to

1559
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,960
secure people in this way

1560
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,119
and so i started this collective called

1561
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,960
metaversible and we're doing training

1562
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,640
and all that stuff right now it's a

1563
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,000
collective of cybersecurity people we're

1564
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,240
just trying to help people understand

1565
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
and be secure out there

1566
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,240
so

1567
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,160
that's it that's it

1568
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,079
five minutes we got five minutes ask me

1569
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,240
anything it can be about this or

1570
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,720
something else

1571
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,839
question right here

1572
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,559
[Music]

1573
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,480
it could be i thought it was i think his

1574
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,400
application business interface is what

1575
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,559
the term i've heard used but abi is

1576
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,960
essentially an api it allows you to

1577
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,839
directly interact with the code

1578
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,760
on the blockchain

1579
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,680
so there's function calls that you can

1580
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,400
do

1581
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
just like any api

1582
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,839
that's an abi

1583
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,119
i think it's application business

1584
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,440
interface but i could be crazy

1585
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,400
what's up

1586
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,480
have you heard of any like uh gaskey

1587
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,559
attacks where people trying to back up

1588
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,720
the gas fees

1589
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,720
you know artificially for whatever

1590
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,760
reason

1591
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,720
i've heard of people um ddos in doing

1592
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,720
all kind of nefarious activity and i've

1593
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,160
i've heard of people raising the gas

1594
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,240
prices one of the things i've seen

1595
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,319
people do is on smart contracts and

1596
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,280
stuff

1597
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,079
uh

1598
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,160
like i said there's bots out there

1599
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,680
and so if you're selling some if you're

1600
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,359
selling a product for instance and and

1601
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,200
you don't want people to bots to come

1602
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,599
buy it what you can do is you can raise

1603
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:40,799
the fees

1604
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,880
on your smart contract and you can

1605
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,079
adjust the fee when you're ready for

1606
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,839
doing business so

1607
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,280
there's there's all kind of there is

1608
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,280
definitely manipulation on both sides

1609
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,559
from an attack and defense perspective

1610
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,360
[Music]

1611
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,839
i've been using coinbase i mean i i've

1612
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,760
been using it uh i've heard good things

1613
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,520
about others not a recommendation all

1614
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,440
but that's just what i've been using i'm

1615
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,520
like super new this space is wide open

1616
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,319
i'm i'm new but just like all y'all i'm

1617
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,480
curious and i do my research yeah but

1618
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,100
are you

1619
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,179
[Music]

1620
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,040
yeah yeah coinbase i have i have a

1621
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,960
google app google authenticator set up

1622
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,119
on her and all that stuff

1623
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,720
and so what you do like let me go

1624
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,319
through this real quick so coinbase you

1625
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,319
buy the crypto and you can transfer it

1626
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,240
to your hot wallet for purchasing stuff

1627
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,400
online that's how it works question

1628
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,240
right back in the back so so what are

1629
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,119
your top three uh tokens for uh

1630
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,400
wrestling

1631
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,240
uh

1632
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,640
that's a trap are you fed

1633
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,000
no one's the best with you no i don't

1634
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,839
no no i don't i don't i don't really

1635
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,119
invest i mean but like you know

1636
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,720
i mean if i was you know i don't i

1637
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
really i'm i'm not an investor so i

1638
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
wouldn't call myself an investor but

1639
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,839
um

1640
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,640
you know

1641
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,920
i don't even comment on that

1642
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,160
but i appreciate the question though but

1643
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
i i heard people get in trouble for

1644
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
giving you know crypto plays

1645
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,850
hit me in the parking lot

1646
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,240
[Laughter]

1647
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,118
any other questions

1648
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,280
what's the craziest malware you've ever

1649
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,960
written

1650
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,200
crazy some hour the thing that i've i've

1651
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,839
written and i see it a lot uh way back

1652
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,319
in the day i read i wrote a javascript

1653
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,119
keylogger in metasploit

1654
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,359
and i've seen that uh and it's in a

1655
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,520
metaphoric still to this day probably

1656
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,359
but i've seen people using that same

1657
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,280
code to do attacks on metamask

1658
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,880
and i'm like holy crap i created a

1659
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,720
monster

1660
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,720
so i created something that javascript

1661
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,000
keylogger it pretty much injects

1662
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
javascript into the thing

1663
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,559
and it does any key it key logs anything

1664
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,559
in your browser so i'm like wow that's

1665
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,480
crazy that i wrote something that's been

1666
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,960
actively used for attacks and that's the

1667
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,200
that's the red teamers curse or red team

1668
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,839
developer curse

1669
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,799
the the api

1670
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,040
is the application binary

1671
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,559
is it binary

1672
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,680
okay good so binary is the is it's abi

1673
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,119
it stands for binary not not business

1674
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,040
what is used is

1675
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,040
foreign

1676
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,319
then you need a translation between

1677
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,160
high-level language and

1678
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,720
the bypass that's where they see the

1679
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,480
icon

1680
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,839
yeah you explained it way better than i

1681
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,020
could explain it i tried my

1682
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,990
[Laughter]

1683
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,960

1684

1685
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,440
