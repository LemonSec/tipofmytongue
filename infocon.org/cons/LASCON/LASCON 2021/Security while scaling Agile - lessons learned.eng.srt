okay

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,320
good morning

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
thank you for coming to this session

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,359
um

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,679
so my colleague as you see there are two

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,039
people here

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,239
my colleague uh maureen is here sit at

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,680
the front he has provided a lot of input

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,200
to this talk

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
since he has another talk at the last

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
count we have decided for me to give

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,680
this talk but he has agreed to answer

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,480
all the questions

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
uh okay

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
we're going we're going to partner

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,839
okay

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,159
security while skating hijab that's our

19
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400
problem

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
so one day

21
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
i met with a

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
product owner

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
i mentioned to him i have

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,640
not seen new security activities

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
recently what's happening

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
and he said we have a new process

27
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
he is kind of excited that kind of

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
yeah he's a welding

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
i said what's that he said save

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,880
and then i say

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,079
save

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,680
s-a-f-e

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
i slowly expelled out he said sure yeah

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,439
save

35
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,320
safe shouldn't you do more security to

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,320
be safe

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,799
so what's going on here what's the

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
problem he wants to be safe and that he

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,799
didn't have time to do security

40
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
activities

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
it turned out

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
he's talking about this

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,599
safe

44
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,239
the skilled agile framework

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,280
and

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
but i was thinking

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
about this

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
to be secure to be safe

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
so um

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
not only i don't see new security

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,760
activities which they

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
have planned to do

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
but also we're not even talking about

54
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,120
the same language so as security

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,760
professionals what do we do in such

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
situations

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
my name is karen and i have worked in

58
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
the security and the privacy for for a

59
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
long time

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
currently i'm a principal

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
security architect

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
it's weird i always want to learn here

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,440
but the voice will change

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,319
so i'm a principal security architect

65
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,280
with

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,879
palace

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,560
more specifically i'm working with our

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
cloud production

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,920
cloud protection

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
business line

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
as we know um

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,159
there's some trend in the past uh two

73
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,440
decades

74
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
they um

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
the important thing is the technology we

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,120
all know right the technology

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,560
innovations

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
has

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
changed our lives everyone's lives a

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
great deal so this has created

81
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,959
high demands

82
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,680
for quick deliveries for continuous

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,519
deliveries of products with live trend

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
on the one hand

85
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,040
to meet these demands

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,319
the software security the software

87
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
development process

88
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,920
kind of went through

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
a lot of many transformations

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,239
you may

91
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,680
have different transformation

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,760
transformations that you may be using

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
different frameworks

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
than we do

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
but we have went through from

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,079
agile development model you know from

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
waterfall to agile and now we're moving

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
to scaleio maybe you are doing something

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
similar not necessarily the same

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
same framework

101
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
on the other hand

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
as we know the cyberspace is quickly

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
expanding

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,600
and

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
at the same time we see a

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
great increase

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
of malicious activities especially

108
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
since last year because of lockdowns

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,880
everybody worked from home

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,680
and

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
at the same time

112
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
the software composition become more and

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
more complex all these

114
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,520
made the software security more and more

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,800
important right so we have to expect the

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
software

117
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
development process is changing and the

118
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,000
security becomes more important

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
then as

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
security practitioners like us like all

121
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,039
the people in this room

122
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
um we really don't have any choice but

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
join the journey of

124
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
what is changing right join the journey

125
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
of the software engineers that has been

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
going through

127
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,360
so the question is

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
how do we do that

129
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
how can we

130
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
go along the journey and be the guard

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
wheel without being

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,600
road blockers i've been

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
i've been told i'm the road blocker you

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,840
break your block releases how do we do

135
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,599
without being the goal bloggers

136
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,479
so in this talk we will share our

137
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,440
experience and the lessons learned

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,759
in adopting our security process

139
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,600
to the evolving

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
software development

141
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
activities

142
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
so um we will talk about at each

143
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,840
stage our challenges

144
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,639
our challenges uh facing the change of

145
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
the software process and

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
how do we adapt what changes are we made

147
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
to work out to the software process

148
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,680
and another thing is the journey

149
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
continues

150
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
we're not at the end of the road right

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
and

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
what additional work we still have to do

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
as we mentioned earlier you may be going

154
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,680
through different transformations you

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
may be using different frameworks then

156
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
we'll currently use called safe a nice

157
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,400
name

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,080
however what we learned

159
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
what we learned from our experience

160
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
not only will help us

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,440
um toward future changes hopefully

162
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
this will be helpful for you as well

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
um

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,440
so let's

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,520
start the

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
journey

167
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
so um

168
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
the division the business lines i'm

169
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,479
working with at palace

170
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,039
we provide security products

171
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,400
and services to our uh customers

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,319
so the software security is is critical

173
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
to our business

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
so we do take it seriously and um i

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
understand from then talk to this

176
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
morning not all the companies

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,400
uh

178
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,479
treat it seriously but

179
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,520
we're a

180
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,039
security company and uh to so too many

181
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,479
security uh activities we do have a

182
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,560
software security insurance plan um so

183
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,479
we we have

184
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,520
we we do have um software products and

185
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
also hardware products so we have

186
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,160
firmware and we don't talk typically say

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
application security software security

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,199
so um we have insurance plans which

189
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,560
include a set of security activities and

190
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,680
also monetary security requirements then

191
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,919
we have tools we have trainings and so

192
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,199
on so forth

193
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
and so um

194
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
and then to support that

195
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
we have a

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,039
software security community

197
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
they are they

198
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,279
security champions within the community

199
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
they are not

200
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
full-time security people and they are

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,600
like people like maureen they are

202
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
security champions they are within the

203
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
product team

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,839
like for example maureen

205
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
he's a software engineer he's also a

206
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,000
architect and his swamp master his

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,800
technical lead and importantly he's a

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,440
security champion so all our security

209
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
champions are within the team

210
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
so in the past

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,519
um

212
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
most of our product lines

213
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
use uh waterfall models

214
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
probably is true for someone some of you

215
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,920
that's in the old days

216
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,519
so the product development life cycle

217
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,320
looks like this right and you have uh um

218
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,200
we start with big right and then you

219
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
answer ifps

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
and you you launch normally product

221
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,279
launch is a big deal and then you do

222
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
study you develop you and then your

223
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
acceptance you end up with operation or

224
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
you

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
if the customer operates themselves that

226
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
you have a warranty period right so it's

227
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,600
uh most products go through this process

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
and uh

229
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
so at each stage there's a formal

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
process to decide if or not we can go to

231
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
the next stage

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
so the and a lot of things are very

233
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,440
formal the documentation and the review

234
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
and i remember

235
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,519
in my younger days so you have formal

236
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,720
technical review for each stage

237
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
and then our security plans were defined

238
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
accordingly um

239
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
and at each uh stage of the product life

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,839
cycle

241
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,480
we have various security activities you

242
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
have to perform

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
and then before you go to the next stage

244
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,760
all these activities have to be verified

245
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
we have total about 50 security

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
activities in total

247
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
so the plan actually worked in the past

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
and then as we mentioned from the

249
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,079
beginning right due to the business need

250
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:00,959
of

251
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
an industry industry trend for

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
continuous delivery so the product lines

253
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,839
have started to transition

254
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,959
into

255
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,560
agile process

256
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,079
look like that right and as you you know

257
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,360
that is an iterative approach

258
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
it helps to deliver values to customers

259
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,079
faster and reduce the the risks for for

260
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,839
each

261
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,720
deliveries um so the agile teams they

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,000
will work on in small but consumable

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
increments

264
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
instead of making big releases

265
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
every six months a year or two years or

266
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,640
even more right so it is an iterative

267
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
process

268
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,920
as you can imagine

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
the um

270
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
our previous plan which follows the

271
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,399
waterfall model which does not fit in

272
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,320
this small quick cycles very well right

273
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
and how do we the question the challenge

274
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,399
for us

275
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,920
is how do we map our rich set of

276
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
security activities

277
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,120
um

278
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,680
through this actual process

279
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,639
that's that's the first transition we

280
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,519
had

281
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,880
so we had various uh challenges

282
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,480
in in the past

283
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
a product team is typically organized by

284
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,040
components of the product when i see

285
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
product products that include services

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
we also have cloud services

287
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,360
or a solution right

288
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,399
and uh

289
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
so the team is um

290
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,760
it's it's larger and each team could

291
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
could be responsible for uh several

292
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,600
related components for example you could

293
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
have a team which worked on the

294
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
server-side components and then another

295
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,839
team which focused on the client side

296
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,440
and then

297
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
with this ideo in order to fast move

298
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,000
around

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
they the team has reorganized

300
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,560
into smaller

301
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,079
swamp teams

302
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,200
so

303
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
so each teams

304
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,839
at

305
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,000
each uh

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
period in time

307
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,639
and

308
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,320
well in azure i mentioned i haven't

309
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,160
mentioned that in each loop what they

310
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,880
call the sprint right they and the

311
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,079
small team will focus on a particular

312
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
small feature to deliver as quickly as

313
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,000
possible and in order to do that

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the the team may touch more than one

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,199
component

316
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,959
so it's a complete uh reorganization you

317
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
can think of as before it's more

318
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,760
functional my server my component my

319
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,880
database is more functional now we have

320
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
cross-function notes but it's a small

321
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,079
team just focusing on one feature and

322
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,920
which may touch different components

323
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,040
with this change we also have a larger

324
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
number of teams than it was before you

325
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
can imagine before we have two teams now

326
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,240
we may have five which in parallel

327
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,639
deliver different features

328
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,480
and at the same time

329
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,079
they uh we saw um with those quick

330
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,079
cycles that uh sprint and it typically

331
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,120
it's

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
last one to four weeks so it's very

333
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,320
short cycle instead of six months one

334
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
year or two years in the old days we

335
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
plan really on year day basis right now

336
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,399
we have to plan for these very short

337
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,360
circles

338
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,639
and then engineer manager just told me

339
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,199
karen we cannot do all these security

340
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,519
activities you have 50 of them how do

341
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
you expect every strong team to do all

342
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,680
this in every small small circle in

343
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
every sprint

344
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,519
what do we do right and

345
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
so um we did several things

346
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
um first so we uh we broke the fixed

347
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
boundaries in the model waterfall model

348
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,600
and we re-oriented

349
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,399
the

350
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,160
security plan

351
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,240
for continuous assurance

352
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
we want to make security as part of the

353
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
engineering process

354
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,760
so that's what we wanted to do

355
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,639
practically um

356
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,920
during

357
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
during the transition

358
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,040
and they focus on deliver features we

359
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
have to realize

360
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
all not all the features that are

361
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
related

362
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,160
to are relevant to security uh for

363
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,560
example at the time we're also making

364
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,759
transition

365
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,199
of the the user interface in the old

366
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,000
days

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
and then we have ux design team some of

368
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
the uh delivery some of uh some of the

369
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
screens that um they are working on um

370
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,320
purely changing the user interface

371
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
from uh the traditional interface with

372
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
the buttons to the more modern

373
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
interface without changing any of the

374
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,839
flow so for this work we really don't

375
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
need to uh to do the uh

376
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
activities right so we realize not not

377
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
every venture spring and every strong

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
team need to go through all these

379
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
activities

380
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,160
so

381
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,800
the the first thing we actually did

382
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,839
was

383
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,839
to reorganize

384
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
how we express the security activities

385
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,079
we need to do and we basically um

386
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,360
to fit the

387
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
skill that style we grouped

388
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
the activities as i mentioned the

389
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,199
45 50 of them into about a dozen agile

390
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,000
stories we follow basically the same

391
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
style as the team used to express

392
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
the uh the tasks need to be done group

393
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
them into

394
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
into stories

395
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
so remember i mentioned the engineering

396
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,240
manager told me

397
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,919
he's the

398
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,640
the head of a product line and he said

399
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
we can't do this right and uh what

400
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
happened is we actually brainstormed

401
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
together and to try to figure out

402
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,760
how to make the security plan works for

403
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
continuous delivery and

404
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
i was thinking

405
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
last night this is actually important

406
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,880
part the security team you don't have to

407
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
work by yourself

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
you really want to involve with the

409
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,679
engineering team together

410
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
so um

411
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
we we actually

412
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,960
brainstormed a few times and we come out

413
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,600
a uh decision tree you don't see it on

414
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,080
the slide so i just started last night

415
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,559
we came out of a decision tree so it's

416
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,679
basically saying uh if the decision tree

417
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,080
asks a sequence of questions just like

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
the older engineering design right

419
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
and in this

420
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
um in this task

421
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
relevant to security or not right and

422
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
then you decide and i said okay this

423
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
pure ui work i want to change the color

424
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,000
and the location of the button right

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
that's not relevant so you don't need to

426
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,559
do the security stories now we're

427
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,280
creating the stories right and then you

428
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,120
go to the next question

429
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,400
does this work change the architecture

430
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
of the product or not right and then you

431
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
you look at this work it does it's it's

432
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,799
fixing a bug it does not change the

433
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
architecture so you know you do not need

434
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
to do

435
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,240
the security analysis of the

436
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
architecture okay so it's a sequence of

437
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
questions

438
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
and we had a team to to try it out and

439
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
eventually

440
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
with the help of

441
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,440
this the

442
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,720
engineering manager um he said well

443
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
there has to be an easy way a better way

444
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,160
for my team to use right than looking at

445
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,600
this flowchart

446
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,799
so we

447
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,760
developed a tool which still asks

448
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
questions

449
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,280
and they

450
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
they swam team especially the security

451
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,160
champion of product owner depending on

452
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
the team so team operate differently

453
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
they will just go through the tool and

454
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
answer the questions and then at the end

455
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
it will generate

456
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,000
a security stories that needed for this

457
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
particular uh script but for the tasks

458
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,679
they need to do so basically the tool

459
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,880
help the team to define their objectives

460
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,679
and then to create a relevant

461
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
certificate it's not all of them you

462
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
don't have to do all of them and you

463
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
only need to do the ones you need and

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
then we have a dashboard too

465
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
for

466
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
monitoring yeah so another thing we

467
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
figured out is uh

468
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,159
okay

469
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
so i'm not going to talk into details

470
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,720
about that it's basically like that

471
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,360
right and you group all the

472
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,159
detailed activities into stories and

473
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,880
then during their sprint planning and

474
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
then they can

475
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
use the tool to find out what stories

476
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,720
they need what security stories you need

477
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,039
to do and then you you plan for it and

478
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,679
these activities are not equal some of

479
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,400
the activities for example security

480
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,440
architecture risk assessment and

481
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,840
monetary security based security

482
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,039
requirements

483
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,000
for these activities you want to do them

484
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,840
as early as possible because

485
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
because it

486
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
you need to go through them to identify

487
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,600
the issues and then identify the work to

488
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,440
be done and if you do do that too late

489
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,559
and

490
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
you may have to rework it may generate a

491
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,080
new new security issues

492
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,960
so we want to do this especially we

493
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
focus on risk assessment that has to do

494
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,880
as early as possible and

495
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
we really

496
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
then mentioned this morning and one of

497
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,400
the mistakes he's saying is

498
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,280
that you have to do the security and

499
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
uh

500
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
he's not considering the other aspect of

501
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,799
product

502
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,200
and for us uh

503
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
luckily we have been doing that right

504
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
because we are embedded in the product

505
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
lines when there is a vulnerability for

506
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
example to be fixed

507
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
right

508
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
very often you may have more than one

509
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,360
and what you do how do you prioritize

510
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,679
them you do risk assessment there's a

511
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
vulnerability what is the risk or what's

512
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
the impact to our product right so those

513
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,159
that has to to be done um uh early

514
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,280
um

515
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
yeah i've even talked in the past about

516
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
risk

517
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,799
importance of risk assessment

518
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,919
so

519
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,640
now we have tried to align um our

520
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
security plan

521
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,559
through the engineering process which we

522
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,400
moved to agile and with these changes

523
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,360
it

524
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,080
well it seems to be working right and so

525
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,559
we had that for a while

526
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,520
and then the engineering

527
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,880
they um they worked in the igl process

528
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,720
they found

529
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
some other issues

530
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,960
with the process

531
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
it's mainly

532
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
related to the scalability of azure so

533
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,400
as i mentioned that before we have two

534
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,039
three teams and with agile

535
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
a little more teams

536
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,559
more squam teams

537
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,480
now because of the um the

538
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,679
various reasons and the product and

539
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
become

540
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,039
more bigger and more complex we have

541
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,120
more customers we have more work to do

542
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,440
we have more people and

543
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
now

544
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,159
they um for one product line we can have

545
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,000
12 20

546
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
swarm teams

547
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
then it becomes impossible

548
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
to

549
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
coordinate about a dozen or two dozen

550
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,600
teams

551
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,159
together there's dependencies

552
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,720
remember with uh they're all focusing

553
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
delivering new features they may be

554
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
small they deliver very quickly but a

555
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
feature can touch

556
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
multiple components and then you'll have

557
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,799
one dozen or two dozen teams

558
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,559
working in parallel they are touching

559
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
the same components who will do what

560
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
first it's become impossible to

561
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
resolve the dependencies

562
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,039
another problem is state

563
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,000
so there are shared resources that all

564
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
these teams using for example the

565
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,000
platform the security documentation and

566
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
the marketing and uh

567
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
it's very hard to get commitments

568
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,520
from these shared resources because all

569
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
these teams are competing for shared

570
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,200
resources

571
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,240
and

572
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,039
then

573
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,320
it's also difficult for management

574
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,360
to have a visibility of future resources

575
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,960
future future releases right as before

576
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,760
it's it's fixed now you have all these

577
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,080
teams trying to make release what's

578
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
coming when it's coming it's more

579
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,200
difficult

580
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,640
so um that's why

581
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,600
safe come to rescue

582
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,880
uh in a sense and so they

583
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,320
our um

584
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,919
business line has decided to adopt this

585
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,799
process as you may you heard earlier

586
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,200
it's called safe it's a skilled agile

587
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,120
framework

588
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
so this framework

589
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
is um

590
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
the goal of this framework is to help

591
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,640
agile to scale and which uh can be at

592
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,679
the enterprise level what you see is

593
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,159
they call it essential so that's the

594
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
basic setup and they have another they

595
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
call it enterprise

596
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,440
uh agile safe that basically you have

597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,000
another layer you can have coordination

598
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,039
between different product lines

599
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
but let's talk about just safe

600
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
and uh so within the the

601
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,080
the product line you'll have a number of

602
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,200
swamp teams right you can have a dozen

603
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
or two dozen and then uh someone had to

604
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,440
coordinate this work and they call it

605
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,600
release train engineer and there are

606
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,159
other roles i'm not going to to mention

607
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,720
um but the safe

608
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
safe they have the concept it's called

609
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,840
agile you will see agile release street

610
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,919
on the top of the slides

611
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,640
so it emphasizes continuous exploration

612
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
and continuous integration and a

613
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
continuous deployment

614
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,360
so agile release training also called

615
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,240
art

616
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,919
okay

617
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:18,640
so

618
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,840
the

619
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,200
the progress of this train this art

620
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
is defined

621
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
by something they call the program

622
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,039
increment that's what you see the

623
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,279
the bigger uh

624
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
yellow bars that's called a program

625
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
increment

626
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,240
so the program inside each program you

627
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,640
increment you can have iterations on

628
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
your code sprint

629
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,840
and you can deliver as many as often as

630
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,690
you want but everything

631
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,799
[Music]

632
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
every feature has to be split and split

633
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,559
until it fits into

634
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,000
api the program implement that we call

635
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
pi and at the beginning of the pi

636
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
there is a

637
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
pi planning activity it's called pi

638
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,919
planning that's when everyone involved

639
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,360
in this art

640
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
will get together to do the planning

641
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
and so they

642
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,840
the art can have 100 or 200 people they

643
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,880
were from it's all the stakeholders from

644
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,320
developers

645
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,919
to business owners and everyone

646
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,640
in between and product management system

647
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,760
engineer and the business owner and the

648
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,720
marketing and product owner and everyone

649
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,399
get together so with these pi plannings

650
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,080
objectives

651
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,399
are committed up

652
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,840
defined

653
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
for this pi

654
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,320
objectives are defined and committed you

655
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,720
have to commit to these objectives and

656
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,120
the details plans are made they made

657
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,480
details plans and they resolve all the

658
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,279
dependencies of all the different teams

659
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,559
who will do this first so you don't bump

660
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
into each other

661
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,600
so um everything is

662
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,679
all the scalability issues that we

663
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,559
mentioned earlier are resolved during

664
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,120
this pi training

665
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,559
so everything is time boxed it's fixed

666
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,440
how long the pi is it's typically eight

667
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,240
to twelve weeks and then within it you

668
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
have springtail

669
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,960
three weeks let's say everything is is

670
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,919
fixed

671
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,799
now

672
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,279
these all the product teams start to

673
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,880
move to here

674
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,520
now as you can imagine a search

675
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,559
structure will present new currencies to

676
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,520
our security process right that's why

677
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,240
your you we had a conversation you heard

678
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
at the beginning right we have a new

679
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,919
process that's why we're not doing new

680
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,120
security

681
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,880
activities

682
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,640
so uh

683
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
there are several challenges so we just

684
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
list a few of them as i mentioned

685
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,559
everything is time boxed and people tell

686
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,600
me it's not possible to finish your own

687
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,720
security plan for every pi

688
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
or some other people saying how can you

689
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,559
tell us to do all these security things

690
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
within the pi right

691
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,399
and that that's one problem that's the

692
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,919
time box the other problem is

693
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,640
the

694
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,120
with the skilled agile

695
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,720
they it's a value driven process

696
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,399
so uh

697
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,000
that they the goal is value that's the

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,240
the biggest thing for azure is value you

699
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,960
want to deliver values as quickly as

700
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
possible

701
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
so i have security champions as i

702
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,559
mentioned that they're all in different

703
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
product lines different product teams

704
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,279
right the security champions

705
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,480
they they told me we cannot justify the

706
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,720
business value

707
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
for security activities

708
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,159
what does he mean

709
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,720
you know when they do the bipi planning

710
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
you have different activities the way

711
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
they prioritize is by business value and

712
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,600
he said we cannot justify and then the

713
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,520
security stories

714
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,200
are pro prioritized lower than other

715
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,559
activities right than other stories and

716
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,240
sometimes push will push from pi to pi

717
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
that's why the product owner is saying

718
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,039
every time before pi planning and i said

719
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,360
well remember we said we need to do

720
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,320
these security stories and he said i'm

721
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,039
sure i will do it right and after the pi

722
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,520
planning i said you know uh which

723
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
iteration you're going to do and he said

724
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,000
unfortunately it pushed to the next pi

725
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,240
okay so it's a priority spell over

726
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,520
another thing is uh it's more of the uh

727
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,200
engineering uh issue in in the past with

728
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,919
agile the teams they uh they use a

729
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,080
concept that well they use a feature

730
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,120
branch uh branch meaning the software

731
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
branch right and then they will do their

732
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
security stories on the feature and

733
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
before they merge into the main branch

734
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,279
but the safe recommended to use what

735
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,360
they call um

736
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
trunk based

737
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,080
development so you have a main track

738
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,120
basically as soon as your code is ready

739
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,360
you push to the main tracker they have a

740
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,440
reason for it right so

741
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,320
in this way you can do the system level

742
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,880
testing integrating testing as

743
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,200
frequently as possible as quickly as

744
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
possible in order to identify problems

745
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,519
right if you you integrate you merge

746
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,480
later

747
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,000
when you

748
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,799
identify the problem it may cause rework

749
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,039
and the redesign will cause design and

750
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,399
cause delays

751
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,519
that's why

752
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,720
you want to

753
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,960
push to the main trunk

754
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,000
as early as possible so that's also

755
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,960
means for the security

756
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,679
story security activities we need to

757
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,880
perform on the main trunk that means we

758
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,919
need to automate in our pipeline which

759
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,559
we're not there yet

760
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
now what we do

761
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,360
of what we have been doing to address

762
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,200
these challenges

763
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
um we have done a couple of things

764
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,840
since we uh since the teams moved to uh

765
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,480
safe

766
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
first we involve our security plan again

767
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,480
remember the first change is we

768
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,200
reorganized into security stories

769
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,000
and so we actually updated the stories

770
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,840
they using the safe language

771
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,720
and

772
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,919
we

773
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,600
also

774
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,080
provide a better clarifications

775
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,640
and what needs to be done how you do it

776
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
what other tools are available

777
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,159
and

778
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,640
with with the safe language

779
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,799
we safe we actually tried a couple of

780
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,679
things

781
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,279
initially during

782
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,519
safe training

783
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,200
the trainers we

784
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,799
in the safe training they don't mention

785
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
about security right you can imagine

786
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
um so we ask what do we do about

787
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
security the recommendation was

788
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,480
treat them as non-functional

789
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
requirements

790
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,919
we actually tried

791
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,399
and also it works in theory right for

792
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,200
every push and then you

793
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,120
you will finish all these

794
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
activities

795
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,840
um

796
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
but it didn't work um in practice

797
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,600
because for

798
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,720
it's the business owner who prioritize

799
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
all the stories or the tasks

800
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,159
and then they prioritize non-functional

801
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,480
requirements lower than functional

802
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
requirements you can imagine right and

803
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
the functional requirements they see

804
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
value right non-functional requirement

805
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,399
and they don't see that clearly

806
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,679
so it didn't work out well and

807
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,640
however from long run and if we had more

808
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,119
tools automated the non-functional

809
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,280
requirement could be a good place

810
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,159
because you can say if the acceptance

811
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,239
criteria you have to finish all these

812
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,839
non-functional requirements

813
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,679
but at least at the beginning we tried

814
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,960
it didn't work

815
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,839
and if you think about safe is about the

816
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,280
value

817
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,719
in order to go

818
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,960
go along with the advantage driven

819
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,399
process

820
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,679
we started to look through our security

821
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,000
plan right we have all these stories we

822
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,359
look at this security plan and um

823
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,560
then we and then we've identified things

824
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,079
we can call them

825
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,599
enablers so enable us in safe

826
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,960
activities for involving architecture

827
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
improve infrastructure and for

828
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,480
compliance

829
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
so we use

830
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
and it turn out that most of our

831
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,440
security stories can be treated as

832
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,720
enablers

833
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,440
for example instead of tricking

834
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,839
to assess static security testing as a

835
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,680
story and we make automated sas

836
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,200
as an enabler because enabler provides

837
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,599
value for the infrastructure for the

838
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,640
present and the future business features

839
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
they are pro they can be prioritized

840
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
much better so this address the value

841
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
value proposition problem and as i

842
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,599
mentioned earlier because of the main

843
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,960
function because of all these quick push

844
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,000
we need to um

845
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,760
focus

846
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
on automation

847
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,079
so that's more of the

848
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,160
security scans

849
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,920
we want to put the security scans in

850
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
the testing into the the pipeline and at

851
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,359
the meantime we want to provide

852
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,079
better security guidelines

853
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
for um for using these tools

854
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,200
we're also building a security templates

855
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
for pipelines

856
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,880
this is a work in progress

857
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,280
because we have

858
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,640
many different product lines

859
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
each product each product

860
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,599
they use

861
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,079
different languages even within a

862
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,880
product and use different languages and

863
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,359
then they use different frameworks

864
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
and they have different pipeline

865
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,280
technologies some use it lab as the news

866
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,280
github some use team city and

867
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
there's some usage

868
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
there's many different ones

869
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,000
so it's still working progress in terms

870
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,960
of automation into different

871
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,839
different pipelines

872
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,079
uh

873
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,160
so the question is can we automate

874
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,280
everything

875
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,839
right that's ideally uh that's what we

876
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
want to do practically not everything is

877
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,640
automatable

878
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,480
and i remember ben canel was giving a

879
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,880
talk always talk as online talk last

880
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,920
year and talk about things and not not

881
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,200
about human people yeah um so

882
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
aligned with him there's certain things

883
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
that are not automatable

884
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,240
at least with current technology you can

885
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,320
see oh we'll have a.i

886
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,200
that will automate these but it will

887
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,839
take time and believe me i worked on it

888
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,880
for many many years

889
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
so they

890
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,160
for example the security assessment

891
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
when i talk about security assessments

892
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,880
it involves identify your business

893
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,359
assets your supporting assets you do

894
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,880
threat modeling and you assess your risk

895
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,200
and you make management decisions

896
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,400
just think about this this and at least

897
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,440
for now it's not automatable with the

898
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,839
future technology you may be

899
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,960
able to automate some parts of it

900
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,000
and then we have a set of monetary

901
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
security requirements you want to check

902
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,680
your compliance that is not

903
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,119
automatable and maybe some part of it

904
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,359
you can code it that that's what i want

905
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,880
to do but we're not there yet

906
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,280
so

907
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,079
another thing is we really push to

908
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,280
identify security issues as early as

909
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,400
possible

910
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,280
they um i'll tell you a story uh once

911
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,680
they um appeal

912
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,119
um asked telling me we have a new user

913
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,960
flow to make it

914
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,760
um

915
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,160
more user-friendly users

916
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,720
more convenient for users can you look

917
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,520
at it

918
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,920
if um

919
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,640
if it cause any security issues

920
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,599
so

921
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,480
we look at it and did a very quick

922
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,599
analysis

923
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,760
and then we realized that it brings some

924
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,079
medium risk it's not high risk but

925
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,400
bringing medium risk but if you think

926
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
about it it's just trying to resolve

927
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,640
solve some

928
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,599
use cases not major use cases then it's

929
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,760
not worth it to bring the median use

930
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,640
case

931
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,119
and he'll accept it and decide not to do

932
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,000
it but imagine if you do such risk

933
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,720
assessment at the end you you you

934
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,160
already spend

935
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,280
your resources to do the work and then

936
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,839
you realize it's not worth it right so

937
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,320
you want to do the

938
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,880
identify security issues as early as

939
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,680
possible then particularly with safe or

940
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,240
how do you do it and maureen suggested a

941
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,200
couple of

942
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,160
opportunities you can use a research

943
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,119
spike that's what you typically do at

944
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,760
the beginning right so that's a perfect

945
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,880
place you can do your exploration to you

946
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,079
do your analysis for security risk

947
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,160
and if you identify

948
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,560
new issues if you can plan into the

949
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,520
current

950
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,560
um

951
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,200
pi or the work period or whatever you

952
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,599
call and you can do it otherwise you

953
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,000
talk with people you make changes

954
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,640
and you may change the scope or you you

955
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,960
they find you decide you

956
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
you push to the next pi and also the

957
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,640
same as the concept of continuous

958
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,680
exploration that's also an opportunity

959
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,279
to do security analysis

960
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,760
so it's important to build security into

961
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,319
your process again you may be using a

962
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,359
different process the one we usually do

963
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,920
the thing called pi planning right in

964
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,079
safe you have pi planning those are the

965
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,960
vertical bars you saw earlier so we want

966
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
to create security stories

967
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
using the tool we have before and during

968
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
the pi planning right and then talk

969
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,520
about security other pi finding and then

970
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,240
you plan your capacity for security

971
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,680
worker during the peer planning

972
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,880
and then for finding the capacity and

973
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,920
our product teams are very creative they

974
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,000
know how to do it and they can they may

975
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
plan the capacity for security worker

976
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,920
directly and

977
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,319
they may reserve some they preserve some

978
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,640
capacity for dealing with unknowns

979
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,680
that's the

980
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,359
that's a good place also to um to do the

981
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,800
security work

982
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
and then um

983
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
and also um

984
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,599
when we talk about a release train level

985
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,599
they typically also reserve some

986
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,400
capacity for pure 100 million work that

987
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,200
is not controlled product owner

988
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,240
that's also an opportunity

989
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,440
so with these changes the security is

990
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,920
well embedded into the engineering

991
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
process

992
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,839
um

993
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:02,720
so

994
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
the journey continues we still have

995
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,200
order uh to do and uh um because

996
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,640
they the

997
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,440
engineering process has changed

998
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
and it will change

999
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,160
right it will not stop there so we

1000
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,680
cannot stop evolving our security

1001
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,599
process we have to go along the way and

1002
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,440
for example the maturity of our security

1003
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,160
champions as as you uh

1004
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,119
uh so we do have trainings right and

1005
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,160
another thing is as you all all know

1006
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,200
there's

1007
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,319
um

1008
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,359
there's a lot of they call it a great

1009
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,480
resign

1010
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
right since cohen a lot of companies

1011
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,079
you know have people changing uh

1012
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,520
changing places

1013
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,920
um people resign here and go to other

1014
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,960
places and we are not isolated

1015
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,520
especially our security champions

1016
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,599
they're they're really really good and

1017
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,920
it's very easy to be grabbed by other

1018
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,160
companies then we have new security

1019
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,960
champions we have continued continued

1020
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,240
learning

1021
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,359
so

1022
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,800
that's not um yeah that's a continuing

1023
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,319
process and we also want to continuously

1024
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,280
improve our process in terms

1025
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
especially in terms of automation

1026
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,920
guidelines and and the tools there's so

1027
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,440
many security tools and we have to

1028
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,760
evaluate them and

1029
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,160
figure out and test them and figure out

1030
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,560
how to integrate in in the pipelines

1031
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,079
okay so um

1032
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,760
yeah

1033
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,280
so uh what what our takeaways um i think

1034
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,000
today uh to think back i think it's

1035
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,280
very important to work closely with the

1036
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,800
engineering team

1037
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,760
and that

1038
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
in the uh

1039
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
many of the things is

1040
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,640
in my experience is really

1041
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,839
resolved by working with engineer

1042
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,480
directly and um

1043
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,200
and also with not just the people like

1044
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,680
mooring by and if he can do everything

1045
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,839
and you also want to work with

1046
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,880
engineering managers product owners

1047
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,920
which is

1048
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
very important because product owner

1049
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,280
will

1050
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,760
prioritize the tasks

1051
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,880
and

1052
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,359
we want to embed the security in the

1053
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,079
engineering process that's what we said

1054
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,839
earlier and automated security tasks as

1055
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,920
much as possible

1056
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,119
and as security people just be friends

1057
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,319
with engineers and product owners

1058
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,280
and

1059
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
be persistent

1060
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,599
be patient and be helpful

1061
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,930
thank you

1062
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,930
[Applause]

1063
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,720
sorry i talk longer than i suppose okay

1064
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,200
questions

1065
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,599
and a marine can answer okay

1066
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,960
earlier

1067
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,560
you're talking about generating a set of

1068
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,960
stories

1069
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,599
do you have a concrete example or were

1070
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,119
those cards on the previous page the

1071
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,040
examples like generate a sas story or

1072
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,119
security or was it was it something a

1073
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,640
little bit more connected to what they

1074
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,319
were building like

1075
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,240
i could talk about

1076
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,560
the project

1077
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,319
i can talk about it if i want to show

1078
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,520
you i have to connect to vpn

1079
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,880
i can't do it

1080
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,960
it's everything is online but i can talk

1081
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,599
about it right so initially when we

1082
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,079
first changed to agile right and um

1083
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,440
they uh

1084
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,640
so uh the the story would be uh

1085
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
let's see uh

1086
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,160
a

1087
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
risk that's you know the the security

1088
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,200
scam you will say it's a purely ideal

1089
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,920
way you will say as a product owner i

1090
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,119
want to see my product go i want to see

1091
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,480
the product go through they uh they

1092
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,920
static security assessment tools i want

1093
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,720
to see the report and then you know

1094
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,160
definition of done is they the result

1095
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,240
there is a result and the height and the

1096
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,280
critical risk that has been uh has been

1097
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,960
addressed

1098
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,280
yeah so it's that style

1099
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,000
and

1100
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,280
then um

1101
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,079
and then with with the safe with skilled

1102
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,720
agile we change the style again for

1103
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,000
example uh but the same the same task

1104
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
right you need to do the security scan

1105
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,480
we change it as enabler when you have

1106
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,800
enabler you don't need to say as a state

1107
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,960
holder i have to do something and then

1108
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,960
we can change the story into um enabler

1109
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,520
story it will say build sas tools into

1110
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,480
the pipeline and then you scan it every

1111
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,280
time you push and then these are the

1112
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,560
tools that you can use and these are

1113
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,119
here are the guidelines

1114
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,079
yeah

1115
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,240
yes so basically

1116
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
so the stories were called subclass so

1117
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,000
it depends the scale

1118
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,559
it would escape

1119
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,400
like since we are doing continuous uh

1120
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,800
featured tvs so first they are mostly

1121
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,800
sub tasks for a single story and

1122
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,319
depending on the feature what kind of

1123
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,680
changes you're doing

1124
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,200
if the tool would create the task for

1125
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,960
your income sas you need

1126
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
stories that were applicable to that

1127
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
team whatever work that team was

1128
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,280
assembling um yes so again um

1129
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,720
every generally in uh jira terms it's a

1130
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,440
bigger thing right okay so but in terms

1131
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,839
of uh for features small features we are

1132
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,760
talking about stories with subtasks

1133
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,200
something which can fit into within a

1134
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,480
single string

1135
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,240
uh but if you are doing it for something

1136
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,400
like a new component for which you need

1137
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,800
to do all the setup for a set of the

1138
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,040
pipelines or dash directivity in that

1139
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,960
case yes we can go with separate stories

1140
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,400
but then he's speaking for a particular

1141
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,000
feature we end up creating a single

1142
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
story with all the subtasks for perform

1143
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,680
the sas for this and generally with all

1144
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,440
of those things now automated

1145
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,839
you don't need to do much over there to

1146
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,960
perform for the finger single feature we

1147
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,559
are just running the jobs making sure to

1148
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,640
run verify the analysis and do the

1149
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,480
features over there based on that so

1150
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,400
based on the since we are doing

1151
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,160
and that's the difference between the

1152
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,599
uh the

1153
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,079
waterfall versus agile and even within

1154
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,079
entire continuous delivery where you're

1155
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,240
delivering every small features over

1156
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
there so the scale of the security

1157
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,800
activities you need to perform they are

1158
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
also used a lot right so i think you're

1159
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,160
doing small tasks rather than the bigger

1160
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,079
stories whichever speaking episode i

1161
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,440
think one of the things i found a little

1162
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,720
fascinating

1163
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,160
and maybe this is somewhere you're going

1164
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,520
in the future and

1165
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,440
a problem that i'm faced with right now

1166
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,640
is i have

1167
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,119
650 different engineers globally spread

1168
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,640
across

1169
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,000
and

1170
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,440
what you're describing i would put under

1171
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,839
my security epic for whatever pipeline

1172
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,000
they're doing they have to enable these

1173
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,839
hygiene activities

1174
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,960
inside their their product that they own

1175
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
but what i started to hear a sense of in

1176
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,000
your talk that i thought was very

1177
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,599
intriguing was when you had a tool that

1178
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,359
was generating this

1179
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,880
and that two

1180
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,400
the non-pro the description about

1181
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,760
non-functionalities that's the exact

1182
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,119
same approach i'm doing because i'm

1183
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,680
creating standard non-functionals

1184
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,480
for program owners and teams to consider

1185
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,160
from a large menu especially just like

1186
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,319
the the oauth

1187
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,839
validation screen

1188
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,319
and say which ones are applicable to you

1189
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,559
each time and pop them up the fact that

1190
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,160
you have a tool that helps screen and

1191
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,559
identify i think that's a very powerful

1192
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,280
very powerful concept but this ties to

1193
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,960
like a very specific thing like

1194
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,400
authentication

1195
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,280
here's your abuse test and

1196
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,599
misuse tests that should come along with

1197
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,160
your authentication requirements

1198
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,319
and i think over there the same three

1199
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,920
that the client was mentioning that is

1200
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,359
helping around because

1201
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,200
uh for every we are talking about like

1202
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,240
15 to 20 swim teams i mean it's

1203
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,400
difficult for karen to

1204
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,079
monitor all of them saying okay make

1205
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,440
sure you're doing all those tasks or not

1206
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,200
right right so for those with those the

1207
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
same kind of people saying okay

1208
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,040
what kind of changes you're doing and

1209
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,800
based on that rule tells okay yeah this

1210
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,720
security is incredible for you make sure

1211
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,319
you do that kind of thing so that is

1212
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,079
everything a lot over there especially

1213
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,079
like the size you're talking about i can

1214
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,680
imagine how difficult it would be over

1215
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
there to apply that right so we are

1216
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,680
talking about the art of like 200 people

1217
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,200
and we

1218
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,400
before we moved to safe uh it was being

1219
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,319
very difficult to manage with safety a

1220
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,160
few things require improve like the

1221
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,480
visibility uh not not within just in

1222
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,640
training but also at the management as

1223
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,280
well as across the shared resources i

1224
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,359
think that solved the issue a lot for us

1225
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,280
uh and with the security part over there

1226
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,400
getting integrated with that

1227
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,119
it's it's yeah

1228
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,960
it correct the stories and you see the

1229
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,280
status that you can do

1230
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,160
and i cannot uh yeah let me finish this

1231
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,880
i cannot emphasize more

1232
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,520
of working with engineering team

1233
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,599
directly and i'm sure you all have

1234
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,839
security chemo so when i started a

1235
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,960
couple of years ago we have over six our

1236
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,119
product plan i mean our business line we

1237
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,160
have

1238
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,240
over 600 engineers

1239
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,480
and i'm the only person full-time

1240
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,839
security architect and then uh we have

1241
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,920
another person just two of us

1242
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,240
just imagine how do you cover this right

1243
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,680
that's why we

1244
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,760
we have security campaigns people like

1245
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,920
maureen who helped a great deal

1246
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,079
otherwise you know two

1247
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,359
um two people and over 600 people 100

1248
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,839
years and now we have we're lucky we

1249
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,720
have a few more uh people but in still

1250
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,599
just

1251
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,640
barely one percent of full-time security

1252
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,000
we fully rely on our

1253
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,960
security champion program
