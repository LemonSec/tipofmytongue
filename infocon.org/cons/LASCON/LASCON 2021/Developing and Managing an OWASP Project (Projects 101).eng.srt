1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:18,800
[Music]

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,400
all right this thing's on

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
i don't know it's uh

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,519
two o'clock i don't know about you but

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,359
this is about the time that i like to

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
grab a coffee so if any of you decide to

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,960
lay your heads down instead and just

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
fall asleep that is okay by me i will

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,559
not take it personally

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,160
all right we're going to be talking

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,320
about developing and managing an oauth

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,160
project this is a very high level

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,559
projects 101 style

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,120
of a conversation

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
what we'll be going over here is the

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,280
introduction and start how to start a no

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,520
watch project

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,320
an introduction to the oas website pages

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,760
because we do things a little bit

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
differently we use github pages when

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,239
we're doing

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,920
our website

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,760
we will go over a little bit about

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,320
sponsorship funding

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
a very little bit about vendor

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
neutrality that's a big topic in today's

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
project world

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,960
the project committee is currently

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
focused on that i guess you could say um

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
we will also go over what the project

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
levels are how to graduate a project

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
and assuming that you've been around for

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
a while or you're tired of the project

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,520
how to go about

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,798
end of life in the project

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,439
so

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
you know why start an oauth project it's

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
an excellent question um

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,360
most people

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,720
start by

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
you know they have a love of open source

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,320
and they believe that there is

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,280
some

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
um

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
some

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
domain if you will

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,640
that

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
needs

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
more tools or more resources and and

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,719
they believe that application security

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
can change the world

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,959
or they just have knowledge a lot of our

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,920
our projects are documentation projects

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,959
where

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,280
os top 10 perfect example

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
where the

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
the people just want to share what they

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
know about application security with the

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,959
rest of the

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,560
world

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
um another thing that's not on here

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
interestingly enough is like who who can

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
start an oash project

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
and basically as anyone um it doesn't

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
matter whether you're in application

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,239
security or not as long as you have an

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,000
interest in it

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
you don't need to provide your resume

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,760
on the form to start a no watch project

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
it's just simply whoever wants to start

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,000
an os project can do so provided they

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
give a few details which we'll go over

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
in just a bit

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
and then if you're not

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
ready to start an os project you might

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
consider contributing to os projects

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
they have the same reasons for

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
contributing as for starting an os

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
project

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,440
and another reason would be maybe you're

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
not quite ready to lead an oas project

82
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,200
and

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,319
hopefully you will be after this

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,239
all right whenever starting an os

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,280
project the first thing you have to do

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,959
is gather necessary for information this

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
is true for everything that you do it's

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,519
not a big surprise

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,040
what you're going to need is a good name

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,480
for your project

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,040
the type of project we will go over all

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,120
these things classification

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
and open source license

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
if you are not the only person who will

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,519
be leading the project you need the

96
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,480
names and email addresses as well as

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
your github usernames

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
it is

99
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
important to have at least a short

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
description of what your project plans

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
to do

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,879
what you expect to deliver with the

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,000
project

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
and a good roadmap

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,959
so what is a good name

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,400
uh

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
first of all it's not an acronym i know

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,400
you see zap up here and that is an

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
acronym that's one of our top flagship

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,399
projects

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,600
zap stands for z attack proxy

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
and

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
the reason why acronyms are not a good

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
name is that they're just not

115
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
descriptive enough zap has been around

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,479
for a long time everybody knows olaf was

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,160
out

118
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
but you don't know you know you down

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
with ott

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that would be the last top ten right

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
that's not what the ghost top 10 is

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
it's the olaf's top 10.

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,120
so you don't you don't want to come in

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,960
with an acronym maybe you can come in

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
with security knowledge framework right

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
that is also one of our flagship

127
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,960
projects

128
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
it is now skf to everybody who knows

129
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,800
the project

130
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
it's better to come in with a good name

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
descriptive people understand it just

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
from that name

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
and not an acronym

134
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
um

135
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
if you're going to

136
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
start a project please do not start it

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,759
with top ten

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,440
okay

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
i mean you're thinking maybe that's a

140
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
good idea but really we get

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
you know

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,080
50 or more i would say top 10 style

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
projects within a particular year

144
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
where people just

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
i want to

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
say that i'm part of a top 10 project

147
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,039
just as the association is and it's not

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
a good choice here we have the oauth top

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
10 top 10 of the top 10 mobile cloud

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
desktop on the edge

151
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
right

152
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
not a good project name

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,880
but you want to be clear and descriptive

154
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,919
definitely not offensive

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
a lot of people like to play with leet

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
speak and throw in a whole bunch of

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
letters instead of

158
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,319
and a whole bunch of numbers instead of

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
letters

160
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,450
believe me i can read those two now

161
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,199
[Laughter]

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
um

163
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
and it does not include need to include

164
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
oauth whenever you're applying for the

165
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
for this project name

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
um

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,199
i will put oasm in front of it

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,639
is not required to put it on the form

169
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
all right briefly let's go over the

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
project types currently there are three

171
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
types of projects at oaus um if you can

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
come up with any

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,199
other types

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,720
if you have a good argument for that

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
feel free to put that in there in the

176
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
text description area

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
but

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,160
we have the documentation project that's

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
basically

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
it can and any of these projects could

181
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
contain pieces of other ones this is

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
just the top level

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,639
designation for the project so

184
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
documentation is like the top ten

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
sam there's our acronym but they have an

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
actual name right

187
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
security knowledge framework all these

188
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
are documentation projects code projects

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
or things let's say mod security core

190
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
rule set samurai wtf and

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,080
tools or zap defect dojo dependency

192
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,360
track

193
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
documentations documentation code and

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
tool there's a little bit of you can

195
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
look at those as a kind of mixture

196
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,599
between the two code is basically

197
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
either pieces

198
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,560
that can be used in other things right

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,479
or it's a particular application

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
in and of itself tools are meant to be

201
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
used like with other tools as part of

202
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,759
say like a pipeline or something like

203
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,800
that and that's the reason why

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
you can see defect dojo zap those guys

205
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
are down there

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
and then there's the classification um

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,680
i don't know how many people actually

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
think that these are applicable

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
right

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
it's getting really difficult to

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,759
determine where these fit within a

212
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
particular project so i'm not

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
i'm not a stickler on you

214
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,800
choosing one and it has to stick in this

215
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,199
particular classification but as you can

216
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,560
see the builder are for tools and

217
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,240
applications not specifically offensive

218
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,479
or defensive

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
a breaker is basically an offensive

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
techniques and functionality kind of

221
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
application

222
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,000
defender concern mainly with defensive

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
techniques

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
and you'll find things like say oh

225
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
awesome zap

226
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,200
well they're going to be all three

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
right

228
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
so it's absolutely not this thing where

229
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
you're one or the other or you can only

230
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
be you know it's always a combination of

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
them so feel free to pick multiples

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
and you will need an open source license

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,440
the open source licenses are all listed

234
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
at this website that you see right here

235
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,120
opensource.org the only one that i don't

236
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
think is on there is the one that we use

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
for most of our documentation projects

238
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,240
and that's that creative commons

239
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
attribution share like 4.0

240
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
that is the vast majority of our

241
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
documentation projects and in fact it's

242
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,479
the one for the oas website in general

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
and submitting a new project request

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,360
this

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,560
um

246
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
you go to this contact loss.org which i

247
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
will show in just a minute and basically

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
what you do is you go to the

249
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
topic that you're wanting to contact us

250
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
about it's a general that is correct

251
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
i cannot read this properly here we go

252
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,959
and there under

253
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
contact us you need to choose one of

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
these options it's the new project

255
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,560
request

256
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
and when you're here you will fill out

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
these pieces and notice that these

258
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
pieces are all what i just told you you

259
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,600
need to gather beforehand

260
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
so you will basically just go out fill

261
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,480
down

262
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
this list you'll indicate whether or not

263
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
you require a github repository i didn't

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
mention that but every project that we

265
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,120
have will have at least one github

266
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,440
repository that being their

267
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
web page repository for that project

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
so how do you plan for project success

269
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
first and most important and believe me

270
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,079
we have

271
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,920
a large number of projects that don't

272
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
complete this first step

273
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
and that's to update your project web

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
page

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
if you don't put your information on

276
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,959
your project webpage people won't know

277
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,839
about your project

278
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
after you update your pr project web

279
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
page you'll need to add your leaders

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
you'll need to find contributors to help

281
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
you with the project

282
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
you'll gather sponsors apply for grants

283
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,000
and

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,480
eventually provided that you get past

285
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,440
the initial what we'll call alpha stage

286
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
you'll want to get your project promoted

287
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
let's go over these things all right

288
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,120
the os

289
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,959
website itself is based on jekyll and

290
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,839
github pages we move to the

291
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,760
website january 2019 i believe it was

292
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,519
from the old wiki and i don't know most

293
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,760
of you people probably have seen the old

294
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,079
wiki

295
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
yes thank you

296
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
that was my reaction too when i first

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
looked at it

298
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
so now we're on at least what looks like

299
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,880
a more modern website i hope um there is

300
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
some javascript in it for some of the

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
dynamic content because

302
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
um jekyll is static

303
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
and

304
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
azure functions that we use for some of

305
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,959
our internal things if you go and use

306
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
the membership page to

307
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
sign up for a membership you're using

308
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,839
azure functions through

309
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,480
the um through javascript

310
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
uh

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
let's go to that os project chapter

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,800
example right quick

313
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,839
and you will end up once you've applied

314
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,760
and got accepted you'll end up with a

315
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
page that is

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,079
a project page and the project page will

317
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
look something similar to this it will

318
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
have that text that says this is an

319
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,760
example

320
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
it will have that main tab the example

321
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,760
tab it will not have most of the stuff

322
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
below that because that's just a bunch

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
of um

324
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,200
examples that i put in for

325
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,959
eventual project leaders to go look at

326
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
this page and say hey how do i do a

327
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
particular thing and it will be in this

328
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
page to help out

329
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,760
this migration page a secondary page by

330
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,600
the way if you're taking pictures don't

331
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
worry about taking pictures of the

332
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,920
particular

333
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,680
urls as i will have a whole long list

334
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
of qr codes that you can take pictures

335
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
of

336
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
at the end of this

337
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,880
but the migration page is got a whole

338
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
lot more examples we will go look at

339
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
that in just a second as well

340
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
but first back to the

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
project page

342
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,880
so the project page once you get it you

343
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
will get an email basically telling you

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
that this page has been generated and

345
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
that you can go to the very bottom of

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,600
the page

347
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
and click on this nice little link

348
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
saying edit on github

349
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,360
and that will present you with

350
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
that index.md page on github let's look

351
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,040
at

352
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
this so we go back to the um top level

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
folder in the repo and you can see

354
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,440
that there are things here and most of

355
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
this stuff will exist for your project

356
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
the important things for you are the

357
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
index.md page

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,000
the info.md page the leaders.md page

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,839
and the tab example a little bit i'd

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,680
prefer you didn't use tabs personally

361
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,560
there is an example to show you how

362
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,639
a lot of our project leaders from the

363
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
old wiki where we had tabs in galore

364
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,480
they

365
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,839
they

366
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,320
pined for the days of the tabs and i

367
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,880
went ahead and implemented a tab

368
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,680
capability on the project pages just

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
so that it's there i would prefer

370
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
personally if you did links and multiple

371
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,079
pages because you can put as many web as

372
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,320
many sub pages as you want to underneath

373
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,839
your project

374
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,160
um you will not have the data or the

375
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,399
includes folder or the posts folder

376
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,760
necessarily but those are there as

377
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
examples as well to show you how to do

378
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
these things because you can change

379
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:40,959
a lot

380
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,399
of the

381
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,279
uh how your page looks just by

382
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
changing includes for instance

383
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
and i want to briefly go over this page

384
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
just to show before we go into any more

385
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,440
of those

386
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
particular markdown files but

387
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
this is a just a screenshot of the

388
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,000
previous page and as you can see the

389
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,519
index.md file is that

390
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,120
piece that's

391
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,279
over on the left hand side

392
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,760
the tabs are up top the main is just

393
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,800
part of um it's there because it's part

394
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,160
of the main page you don't have any

395
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
control over that

396
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,639
but the example tab is

397
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,959
part of the tab example.md and that has

398
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,720
to be named a particular way all your

399
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,199
tabs have to be tab underscore

400
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,440
and then whatever the name of the title

401
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,959
is for that

402
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,359
tab

403
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,079
this top part on the top right and at

404
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
the bottom where it says the oauth

405
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,880
foundation blah blah and the upcoming os

406
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
global events that's part of the theme

407
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,440
just like the top bar at the very top is

408
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,680
part of the theme and so that's just

409
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
part of what's going to be on your web

410
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
page

411
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
the info.md file controls what you see

412
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,360
inside the

413
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
sidebar the example project information

414
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
what kind of project it is what

415
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
classification

416
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
your downloads social links whatever you

417
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
want to put over there

418
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,079
the leaders.md file is where you will

419
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
actually have the leaders listed it has

420
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,560
a particular format as well

421
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,720
so the first thing you're going to want

422
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
to do when you first get to your page is

423
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
go to your index.md page

424
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,759
and you are going to want to edit it

425
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,519
because

426
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
there will be a

427
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,320
bit of text which i which is already

428
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
exist in this one this is an example

429
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
page

430
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
right

431
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,399
and you're going to want to take out

432
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,040
most of that

433
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,040
anything that's in there previously

434
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,160
you're going to want to take that out of

435
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,399
your project page because

436
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,480
i won't know that you actually have a

437
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
valid working project

438
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,399
website

439
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,560
until that default text is out of there

440
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
that's how i can tell whether or not

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,720
it's been updated

442
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
and once you do that then you have the

443
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
level which has already been set for you

444
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
to incubator that's what most projects

445
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
come in as we'll let you know if you're

446
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
for whatever reason perhaps you you're

447
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
bringing a project over from another

448
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
place and you're actually having a

449
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,880
mature project we might change that

450
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
level to lab for instance

451
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
that is all listed within the index.md

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,880
page at the top

453
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
this top information right here

454
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,360
it is called the front matter in jekyll

455
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
this was meant to be partly a training

456
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,280
we would have gone over more in depth

457
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
about how to do jekyll but

458
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
for purposes of this i'm just going to

459
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
show you that this top part between the

460
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,960
three lines and the bottom three lines

461
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
there would say layout title tags etc

462
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
that's called front matter

463
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,240
and you will already have most of this

464
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,000
filled out for you so you won't have to

465
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,919
to do that

466
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
the parts that are important might be

467
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
the tags if you wanted to get particular

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
tags about your project but just short

469
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
example names or whatever descriptive

470
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
things

471
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
the level will be set like i said too

472
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
there's really not much you want to do

473
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
with that and you definitely don't want

474
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,240
to delete it because that will just

475
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
cause major issues

476
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,080
your your site will not build

477
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
and next we can look at real quick the

478
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
info.md file that's pretty

479
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
straightforward right

480
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,918
that was the sidebar at the top right

481
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
and perhaps the more important one would

482
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,200
be the leaders.md file

483
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,320
and this has a particular format

484
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
and it's a required format if you mess

485
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
with this format then i won't know that

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,960
you're a project leader

487
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
so it's basically you have the leaders

488
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
and you list your name and the contact

489
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
addressed

490
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,520
for

491
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,480
you know however you want to be

492
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,039
contacted for your project

493
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,559
and interestingly enough i'll go ahead

494
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
and talk about that now since we're in

495
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,919
the leaders of md file this is also how

496
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,160
you would add leaders to your

497
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
project

498
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,600
it's good to let us know that's that's

499
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
nice

500
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,760
it's not required that you tell us but

501
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,840
it's better to let us know but you can

502
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
put their names in there and it will be

503
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
picked up and we will know that there's

504
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
now another leader on the project

505
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
all right project sponsorship and

506
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
funding this is probably more

507
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,360
um interesting

508
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
projects are encouraged to seek

509
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,200
sponsorship how do you do it

510
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
you're asking me

511
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
it's hard

512
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,880
it's hard every bit of

513
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
if you've ever tried to get a sponsor

514
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
for whatever it is that you're doing

515
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,960
whether it's an event like this event

516
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,679
doing sponsorship is difficult

517
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,640
um

518
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
i will tell you that the funds must go

519
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
through oasp

520
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,960
um

521
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
[Music]

522
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
it is just one of our requirements that

523
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
anybody who sponsors a project

524
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,159
the funds go to oauth and then oas will

525
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,039
provide the funds back to the projects

526
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
but once you have the funds you can

527
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,039
request pre-approval

528
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,000
to spend the money or reimbursement for

529
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,039
expenses that you've already done

530
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
and this is important

531
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,640
you should probably always seek

532
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,000
pre-approval

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,320
before you do a reimbursement just in

534
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
case it's not one of the things that we

535
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
actually cover

536
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,080
in most cases we try to cover

537
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
reasonable expenses

538
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
we also just recently developed a

539
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
program to make it so that projects can

540
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
request grants

541
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,159
what can you do with a grant

542
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
let's say that you get

543
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,880
a company xyz to sponsor your particular

544
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
project and they would like to see you

545
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,640
put in a particular feature in your

546
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
project

547
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,200
they might

548
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
give a grant

549
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
um

550
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
one of our projects just recently picked

551
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
up a hundred thousand dollar grant

552
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,840
the grant can then be turned around and

553
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,559
requested from the foundation which will

554
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
give the funds to the project to save

555
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,360
fund

556
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,679
to people to work on a particular thing

557
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
for three months right

558
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,000
so that's what grants are for

559
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
um and

560
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,760
projects are going to be one of the the

561
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
largest consumers of these grants

562
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
because

563
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,440
you know you've got actual work

564
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,440
deliverables that you need to provide

565
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,440
that particular link i'm not going to go

566
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,400
there for this one it's also on the

567
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,120
qr code later but that will take you to

568
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,799
the

569
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,880
funding portal in order to be able to

570
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,840
request a grant for your project

571
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
how to find sponsors

572
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,440
okay all the projects just like i said

573
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
have a hard time with this

574
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,080
the first place i would tell you to look

575
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,600
is your employer

576
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
a lot of times employers will fund

577
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
particular projects

578
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
especially when it also gets their name

579
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,840
on

580
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,799
a sponsorship tab within the project

581
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,200
being associated with oas does have

582
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,360
certain benefits to that company

583
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,880
so i would always say reach out to your

584
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
employer

585
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,640
next person you could reach out to is

586
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,159
our director of events and corporate

587
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,520
support

588
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,120
um

589
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
she is phenomenal with being able to

590
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,039
bring in sponsors for our events

591
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,039
for trainings for all sorts of things

592
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,039
and if there's one person that

593
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,919
has

594
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,799
and

595
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
just a depth of knowledge on that it

596
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,760
will be her

597
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,080
um

598
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
you also want to search corporations who

599
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,960
target similar fields so maybe your

600
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
company is not interested or maybe they

601
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,880
are and they did sponsor you well that

602
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
doesn't mean you just stick with the one

603
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,600
go find three or four sponsors

604
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
and the more sponsors you have the more

605
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
chance you have of getting those grants

606
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,799
to be able to actually work on your

607
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,879
projects you know specifically

608
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,919
so as i was saying you could put your

609
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,200
sponsors

610
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,320
on a supporters tab or a sponsors tab i

611
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,679
bring this up because this is a good

612
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,640
example of

613
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,360
separating out your supporters from say

614
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
your main page there are

615
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,760
projects that

616
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,320
end up putting say a corporation within

617
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
their main page and that is generally

618
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
frowned upon

619
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
vendor neutrality again what i spoke

620
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,400
about from the project committee they

621
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,279
have a particular

622
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,559
dislike

623
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,678
when projects do that

624
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,120
all right

625
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
speaking of vendor neutrality all

626
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
projects are encouraged to practice

627
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,400
vendor neutrality the big question is

628
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
what does that mean

629
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,279
so the first step leaders should not all

630
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,039
be from one corporation we certainly

631
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
have projects that

632
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
that is true about

633
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
but it's better that if you have say

634
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,679
three people in your corporation want to

635
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,440
work on the project great go find a

636
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
fourth

637
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
who's not from your corporation

638
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,960
um

639
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
the sponsors as i said here need to be

640
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
relegated to a sponsors tab or a

641
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
supporters tab and no sponsor should be

642
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,679
and this doesn't mean like on the same

643
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
line this means no sponsor should be

644
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,039
like

645
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,200
always talked about like you know you're

646
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
using the sponsor name all the time and

647
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,879
not all the other sponsors

648
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
the project itself

649
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
and this is one of the more important

650
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,919
ones should not be used to upsell

651
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,640
to a full version of a project um

652
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
we have a couple of projects right now

653
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,279
that the project committee is looking at

654
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
to try to determine whether this is you

655
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
know are they upselling or is it just

656
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,279
that they're providing a service and it

657
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
happens to be similarly named it's not a

658
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,720
requirement that that your project be

659
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,039
named different than say a

660
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,279
um

661
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,080
a version that you're actually

662
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,640
commercialized right there's no reason

663
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,480
that they can't have the same name

664
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,120
according to our policies

665
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
but they absolutely shouldn't be

666
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
constantly upselling hey if you really

667
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,240
want this feature go buy a real thing

668
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
and the corporation's name should not be

669
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,679
part of the project name

670
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
that should go without saying but

671
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
definitely don't do that

672
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,679
what vendor of neutrality is not that

673
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,720
does not mean you can't make money

674
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
you can absolutely make money with your

675
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,840
open source

676
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
oas project

677
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,880
as long as it's not

678
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,000
you know directly involved in that money

679
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,520
making there are projects

680
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
i won't provide any specific examples

681
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,080
but there are projects that have support

682
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
paid support for

683
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
using the project

684
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
that is perfectly

685
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
fine

686
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
it's just so long as the project itself

687
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
isn't being used to

688
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,279
promote the actual support

689
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
so project levels they are divided into

690
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,520
three categories currently

691
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
count them one two

692
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,919
okay

693
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,279
four

694
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
technically it's three all right

695
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
there's the incubator which is your

696
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,039
basic uh alpha version

697
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
um just now starting out

698
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,600
bugs all over the place

699
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
incubator project

700
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
there's the lab project which means it's

701
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,200
working um

702
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
you've fleshed out what it does it could

703
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
be rough around the edges probably

704
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,799
doesn't have translation

705
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
then there is flagship which is the

706
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,679
actual third thing which is basically

707
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,120
production level

708
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
strategically important to the

709
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,679
foundation

710
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,440
it's preferable that it's

711
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,440
internationalized

712
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
i bring up the mature and put it in

713
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
there because there is no third thing

714
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,440
that's currently

715
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,120
there's no third thing currently but we

716
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,760
are talking about adding a mature level

717
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
and that mature level would be more like

718
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,640
production-ready code just like flagship

719
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,440
but

720
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,039
whereas flagship is strategically

721
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
important to the foundation it would be

722
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,080
something that we would have the board

723
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
vote on and say

724
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,360
this is strategically important the

725
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
board thinks so and now it's a flagship

726
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,960
the mature would be

727
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,720
production level

728
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,320
what currently flagship is basically

729
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,279
and most projects start as incubator and

730
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,440
progress through those stages but as i

731
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
said sometimes they might come in

732
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
as a

733
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,039
lab or even possibly flagship because we

734
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,200
deem it strategically important enough

735
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
okay advancing through the stages you

736
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,520
can

737
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,559
you can request as a project leader

738
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,480
once you believe that your project has

739
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,520
reached a certain level to go from

740
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
incubator to lab

741
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,200
and you would go to this form which is

742
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
also in a qr code

743
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,360
and the project committee

744
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,960
which includes me will review the

745
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,320
project

746
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,279
for the items that are in this form

747
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,200
and we determine whether or not it

748
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,320
should be promoted

749
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,240
we're currently revising how we do lab

750
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,840
the flagship

751
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,279
because what we're with adding the

752
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
mature the lab to mature would be the

753
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,600
same type process

754
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,720
and then maturity flagship

755
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
would end up

756
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,240
again going to the board for a vote

757
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
all right once you become a project

758
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,120
there will be a certain number of

759
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,240
services that you will be able to use

760
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
among those github

761
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,039
docker hub if we can get it to work

762
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,360
again

763
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,520
aws azure gcp those

764
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,279
some of these are based on project level

765
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,360
right we might not provide azure

766
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,240
capability to an incubator project

767
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,279
it really depends

768
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,679
you have meetup if you choose to use

769
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,240
meetup we can absolutely allow you to

770
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,039
use the pro meet up and get people to

771
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,840
join your project that way

772
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
zoom we have jira we have

773
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,720
graphic design services through our

774
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,640
contractor that we use for those

775
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,080
purposes

776
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,799
documentation services absolutely

777
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,720
uh community translation services i

778
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,080
mentioned that because if you need your

779
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
project translated the best place to go

780
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,520
is

781
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
into the community slack

782
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,799
and request

783
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
people because as we know this is a

784
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
global organization

785
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,559
and so we have people in all the

786
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,080
countries around the world who will be

787
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,960
able to help you with your translation

788
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,159
and

789
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,399
project handbook is listed at the end

790
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,080
and i put it in there kind of as a joke

791
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
only because the project handbook needs

792
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
to be revised and it's currently in the

793
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,440
project committee for that

794
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,000
the current version is 2014 and it is

795
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,120
terribly outdated

796
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
um

797
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
project end of life

798
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
at some point

799
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,200
at some point you'll get tired of doing

800
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
the project

801
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,799
or you know something happens to where

802
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,840
you're no longer able to do the project

803
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,919
and you're going to want to

804
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,720
to

805
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
let it

806
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
let it go away

807
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,519
in a way

808
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
you're tired of it

809
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,960
or you know you just haven't been

810
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,399
working on it and what's going to happen

811
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
as we review these projects on a

812
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,679
recurring basis

813
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,000
um you see the activity tracker coming

814
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,120
soon

815
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,399
we will certainly have a place where

816
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
you'll be able to see

817
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,080
the projects that are

818
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,480
most active and who

819
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,559
you know which ones are not active and

820
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
we can see it too so that we can figure

821
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,039
out how to go about this process

822
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
um the two main ways to end your

823
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,279
involvement or project one is passing

824
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,480
the torch

825
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,799
that is the preferred way of course

826
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,200
um and that's the reason why we prefer

827
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,279
you to have at least two leaders on a

828
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,360
project

829
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
because if you have the two leaders then

830
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,240
maybe the second leader can pick it up

831
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,159
instead

832
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,679
much better to have multiple leaders

833
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,840
that way we can pass the torch but if

834
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
you don't

835
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,360
please don't just abandon the project

836
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
you bring it up to me bring it up to the

837
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,600
project committee tell us that you'd

838
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,039
really like to have this project

839
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,519
continue could you find somebody

840
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,559
to help

841
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,960
and we will look for somebody to try to

842
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,720
take over the project we must prefer the

843
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,159
project continue under a different

844
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,480
leader

845
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,840
the last option is the archiving the

846
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,640
project if we just can't find anybody

847
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
or the project has been abandoned for

848
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,480
many years you'll notice that there are

849
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
a lot of projects like that currently at

850
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,159
oauth and that's

851
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,919
because this first part is a little bit

852
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
broken right now we're working with the

853
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,399
project committee to get that fixed but

854
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,399
we'll archive the project if we have to

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,480
all right what project resources are

856
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640

leaders have been around for a very long

865
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,159

and certainly you are welcome to come to

869
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279

871
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,879
we have those monthly

872
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
other leaders another excellent

873
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,559
place

874
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,559
not just the committee and you can find

875
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,919
their contact information on their

876
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
project page it's required that they

877
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,559
have contact information

878
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
the leaders list we have a group

879
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,159
leaders at oauth.org there is a google

880
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,760
group that you are

881
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,320
free to join

882
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,080
and that's a good place to go find

883
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,600
leaders as well as their contact

884
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
information or better and this is the

885
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,399
best place to go is the community slack

886
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,240
i put the invite link up there for you

887
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,760
top channels for that is your oauth

888
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,600
community channel your projects channel

889
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,679
and your project committee channel

890
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,360
and

891
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,120
they are happy to help in all instances

892
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,960
and here we'll go through the

893
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,039
the qr the qr codes that i've mentioned

894
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,440
earlier if you need to find uh these

895
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
particular links and you want to take

896
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
pictures i'll leave these up for a few

897
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,719
seconds for each one of these

898
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,679
there are a lot of them

899
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,679
starting a project that's the form

900
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,079
the example project page was the project

901
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,040
chapter example page i it's also used

902
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
for chapters obviously

903
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
the theme repository i didn't go over

904
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,359
that much because this is a

905
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,719
it'll

906
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,800
it's more of a training thing basically

907
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,719
the theme repository will will help you

908
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,079
out if you need to figure out their

909
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,210
different layouts for your project pages

910
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,399
[Music]

911
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,159
we certainly have more than just the

912
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,879
layout that you saw for that for the one

913
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,960
project page but that's more of an

914
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,599
advanced kind of jekyll type thing so

915
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,680
the migration page which has a bunch of

916
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,760
helpful links and important information

917
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,000
about tabs and how to make those work

918
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,680
that is all on the migration page

919
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
the funding page which will be very

920
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
important to you as a project leader

921
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,820
project graduation

922
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,240
[Music]

923
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,720
also a form it's a google form that the

924
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,759
project committee came up with

925
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
project committee page

926
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
there are other resources for projects

927
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,160
listed on the project committee page

928
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,079
including

929
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,800
an upcoming vendor neutrality brex

930
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,760
best practices

931
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,079
there's the leader's goal group direct

932
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,240
to that

933
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,680
so the the question is what's the best

934
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
way for a student chapter to contribute

935
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,599
to oauth projects

936
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,200
um

937
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,839
there's multiple ways one would be in my

938
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,599
first suggestion provided that you're

939
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,119
not wanting to have

940
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,560
leaders

941
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,599
from the

942
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,760
student chapter

943
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
instead of looking at

944
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,400
creating your own project reach out to

945
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,240
the various projects uh one of the

946
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,800
i don't want to eliminate the labs from

947
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
the flagship projects but

948
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,480
if you go down the list of the incubator

949
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,320
projects i mean the projects that

950
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
probably most need people are those

951
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,560
incubator projects because they're just

952
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,320
starting they probably don't have very

953
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,839
many contributors

954
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,480
if you look through those

955
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,000
find something that interests your

956
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
students

957
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,720
and just offer to can help contribute

958
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,599
because

959
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,520
i don't know a single project leader who

960
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,640
wouldn't jump on oh yeah please you know

961
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,720
i want more contributors

962
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
it allows the students to have a

963
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,320
portfolio where they can show that

964
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,839
they've actually contributed to this

965
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,800
open source security project yep

966
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,560
excellent okay

967
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,610
thank you very much

968
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:16,639
[Applause]
