2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
i am the

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
lead i helped start the

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,080
detection program at atlassian um

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,840
three years ago after a red team

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,679
operation my manager was like hey he's

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,800
like

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
he was like create me a detection

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
program he's like

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
he had a couple rules he said give me a

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
naming convention

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,040
and

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,480
create detection so that this would

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,640
never happen again so we kind of took it

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
a step further i've given a couple talks

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,960
before um about some of the software

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
tooling automation that we've created um

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
to help us in this process so i'm not

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
going to talk too much about that i'm

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,039
actually going to pretty much like glaze

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
over that if you want to find out about

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
that you can go look at one of the other

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
talks from like

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720

they're doing it you know to

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
that's cool so thanks y'all owasp for me

39

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,240
the industry like 10 years ago

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,600
going all the study groups going to the

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,680
meetups going to the conferences that

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
really helped level me up so thank you

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,399
uh some of the first people to mentor me

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
and introduce me to splunk

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,680
which is actually probably why i'm here

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
i'm talking about detections i showed up

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,520
at this video game company called try on

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,320
worlds and uh they were owned by some

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
apt uh if y'all go and look up win in ti

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
more than a game i showed up and they're

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280
like all right here's deal we're owned

53

analysts individual contributors and

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
automation engineers so i've been able

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
to take this from like concept and idea

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
into an actual deliverable

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
and a program and a pretty i think

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,040
pretty mature program um

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,239
and then i'm giving a special thanks to

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,519
my boy ashley blackmore um he helped me

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,480
enable

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
a good he enabled me in a good way and

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
helped bring many of these ideas into

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
concepts and into deliverables he's a

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,319
really badass developer

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
cool so uh y'all can get to know me a

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,360
little bit i'm actually going to kind of

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
get hopefully get to know y'all a little

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,840
i'm going for the

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,440
picture schnitzel his full name is dr

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,079
schizophrene

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
he's got a twitter account that's right

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
yeah if you looked at that at handle on

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
the entry slide that was actually his um

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
the reason i named him dr schnitzelbane

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,000
is because i lived in switzerland for a

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,159
while schnitzel and palm frites that's

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,720
uh hammered pork and french fries you

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,879
can see some hammered pork in him um i

85
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,040
wanted to name him dr evil and then get

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
a matching miniature poodle and name him

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
uh mini-me but uh that's kind of a bad

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
name for a dog so he's schnitzel

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
i like interior design this is jonathan

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
adler i like traveling as i said i just

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,159
did a little bit i'm flying out to

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,319
florida today it's the company i work

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,640
for i'm not a ps5 guy i do love tequila

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,879
guys season tickets fc

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,679
that's matcha

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,400
cool

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,720
all right so

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
is the agenda i uh kind of like lean

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
into the whole keep things a little bit

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
vague at this point to keep y'all

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
interested so

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
um those those like kind of titles might

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
not mean a whole lot but what we're

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,879
going to talk about is some terminology

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,200
my overview of what detections are and

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
some of the motifs with this methodology

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,920
we'll discuss structuring your

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,760
detections we're going to spend a decent

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,159
amount of time on the structure slash

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,720
alerting and detection strategy

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
that term was coined i think by palantir

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,720
um

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
so we'll kind of go into that because i

114
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
do think that's one of the more valuable

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
things about kind of detection

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,479
engineering

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,680
how to apply that in your own

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,639
environment this is going to be one of

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,800
the motifs as well that i talk about i

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,960
find it pretty important that

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
like none of this is prescriptive

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,880
it's really important that you

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
understand your environment you

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
understand how to apply this in your own

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
we're going to talk about some processes

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,000
and rituals

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,160
things that help move and keep this

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,880
machine going and then i basically just

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
like spewed some technologies we can

130
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
kind of have a discussion there if we

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,040
want

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
um and then we'll wrap it up

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,400
so

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
what will help me is kind of get an

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
understanding of who i'm talking to here

136
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,240
so that when i go into details um

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
i know what to say

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
is anybody here an individual

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
contributor

140
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,520
like an analyst okay see my uh somebody

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
managing a sock or something like that

142
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,159
okay cool great

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
okay

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,120
anybody else have a role that they want

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
to yell out to help me understand who

146
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,520
i'm looking at

147
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
cool

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,440
if uh this is fine to interrupt me in

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
this just throw a hand up and um

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,360
we can we can talk mid mid conversation

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
or mid talk um

152
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,759

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
everything or if i was going to show you

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
i can talk about splunk all day

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,759
oh excuse me

164
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
i talk about splunk all day um but this

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,919
is not what we're going to talk about

166

all right so

169
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
this is the part where i ask you

170
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
questions and you think

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,240
it's just i find this really important

172
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
so at the beginning i'll give you

173
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,199
context

174
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,560
at the beginning when we started looking

175
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,120
at detections um we had like kind of

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
like a

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
tribal version of creating detections

178
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
right and so peop some person had made a

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
table and it had just some random stuff

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,039
and it had you know row calm and it was

181
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,720
like this stuff and a lot of it was

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,000
really just superfluous it was extra

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
didn't really add any value and

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
it was like why are we why are we doing

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
this and this was like a really big

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
barrier of entry to analysts creating

187
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,880
more detections because it was boring as

188
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,479
hell and it didn't add any value and

189
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
there was no reason to do it

190
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
so the first thing we started doing was

191
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
stripping away

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
well everything right just like what

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
actually matters to us

194
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,599
and so it's weird that i drew

195
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,240
inspiration from hp tipping point

196
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,199
uh but i did uh it was my first ids to

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,039
really work with and one of the things

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
that i liked about them is their alerts

199
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
i thought were pretty succinct in the

200
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,919
naming

201
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,360
and so that was kind of like one thing

202
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
that i just thought of in the back of my

203
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,479
head at all times i was like what is

204
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,520
important

205
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,199
like so

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
we stripped it down to the to like the

207
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,319
smallest format we could so for you in

208
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,880
your company what data is important

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,000
to the person responding to the alerts

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,759
a lot of times it's not the same person

211
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
that creates the detection that responds

212
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
to the alert

213
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
they need context

214
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
what format is the alert going to be fed

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,240
into

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
a lot of people work with splunk

217
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
there's elasticsearch

218
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,199
but where do those results go into so it

219
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,520
comes out json does it get formatted

220
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
does it like get fixed does it look nice

221
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
does it look pretty does it look ugly

222
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
is it a snort rule is it circada

223
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
what is your detectable

224
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
landscape and infrastructure look like

225
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
aws

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
it's pretty common

227
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
azure

228
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
gcp

229
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
you have web services if you have your

230
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
own specific applications

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
you use kubernetes

232
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,599
do you have workstation endpoint

233
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,360
telemetry do you have server endpoint

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
telemetry

235
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,919
so like

236
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,279
what's important to you

237
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,039
in your environment

238
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,279
is source control important too so if

239
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
you're going to create detections do you

240
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,958
care about knowing

241
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,440
if it's been edited

242
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
do you want to be able to revert

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,519
do you want to like have like a change

244
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
log of every single thing that's

245
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,240
happened to a detection

246
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
is uh are the logs actually usable

247
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
sometimes um

248
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
some parts of an organization will be

249
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
saying hey we need detection coverage we

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
feel like

251
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,399
y'all aren't looking at us it's like you

252
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,120
are not lookable i can't i can't i can't

253
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,640
look at you

254
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,160
your logs are disgusting like they don't

255
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,519
mean anything to me i can't even find

256
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
any auditable actions out of this

257
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,160
you know

258
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,839
it's before you before you can even like

259
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,360
commit to

260
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
saving you know one arm of your company

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,000
with detections you have to make sure

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,839
that they can actually

263
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,360
that they have like data for you to use

264
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
how do you want to communicate your

265
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
results

266
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
right so like

267
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,080
not just your results of the alert

268
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,760
but how do you want to communicate your

269
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
progress in your detection coverage

270
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,240
so

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
if you know that you don't have any

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
detections

273
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
for aws

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
how do you improve it and then after

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,920
you've improved it how do you

276
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
communicate the fact that you did

277
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,000
improve it

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
how do you know that you're improving it

279
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,360
how can you measure your efficacy

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,720
some of these things might not be

281
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,480
important to you

282
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
and that's like that's what that's why i

283
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
this is this is really important to me

284
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,360
because you can go and look at you know

285
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
palantir you can look at mitre and you

286
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,240
can look at all these different

287
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,560
frameworks but they're not your

288
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
environment they built them for their

289
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,319
own

290
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,399
cool so this is my uh general

291
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,600
methodology overview

292
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
um

293
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,920
select an adversarial technique

294
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
that part is pretty uh flexible

295
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,440
so i do like the miter attack framework

296
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
as a starting point at the tactic level

297
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
um

298
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,880
for technique it kind of depends on like

299
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
your maturity level and your like your

300
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
uh your attack surface you know like

301
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,399
what

302
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,839
i mean i mean do you have windows are

303
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
you in a windows environment so like a

304
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,079
lot of a lot of minor techniques

305
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:58,839
are

306
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,160
um tailored towards windows environments

307
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
um

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,320
to be frank most of the stuff that we

309
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
create

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,720
is tangentially related to some of these

311
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
techniques but they're not it's not like

312
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
a one-to-one match up with a technique

313
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
right so

314
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,519
i

315
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
i started a tactic level

316
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,120
um right so like defense evasion lateral

317
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,600
movement privilege escalation

318
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
right that kind of thing

319
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
so in general when creating a detection

320
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
this is what our analysts do

321
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
they research it

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
proved concept is really nice it's not

323
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
always possible

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,079
identify data sources

325
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
for a lot of people just index equals

326
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,440
network kind of

327
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
build the detection rate okay so this

328
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,600
part i didn't put this i didn't put this

329
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
drawing in but

330
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,200
i did a uh

331
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,720
i did a detection class with spectre ops

332
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
um i guess that was

333
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,519
this was two years ago man it's so hard

334
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,880
to tell

335
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
pandemic really changed a lot of stuff

336
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
um i think i think maybe that was right

337
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
before the pandemic it was like

338
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,399
mid-january last shmuchan i went to also

339
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,600
um

340
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
so what he talked about was kind of like

341
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,519
the uh sort of like

342
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,639
i don't know what you'd call it it's

343
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,720
like the spectrum the detection spectrum

344
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,959
right so if you create a detection which

345
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,240
is like

346
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
i'm going to detect mimikat's

347
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,959
you know reading memory zero zero zero

348
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
zero one seven it's like extremely

349
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,360
precise right

350
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
but then if you like just create a more

351
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,760
generic one it's like kind of broad and

352
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,639
so you have you know less like false

353
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,279
negatives you have more false positives

354
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
kind of thing so understanding like

355
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
where your section lands on that

356
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
spectrum it's kind of nice and i'll talk

357
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
a little bit more about that in detail

358
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
this is just kind of the overview

359
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
peer review super important

360
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,399
one of the things that was kind of

361
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,120
initially like

362
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,079
concerning for some people on the team

363
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,519
was that

364
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
we would just kick out detections

365
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
because that was a requirement that we

366
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
decided to make it's like oh we're just

367
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,399
going to kick out like detections

368
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,760
in practice that didn't happen because

369
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,160
people take pride in the work um the

370
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,399
peer review process is kind of difficult

371
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
because things like splunk searches are

372
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
pretty subjective

373
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,920
you know and like unless you're going to

374
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,480
go and rewrite the entire thing yourself

375
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,440
um

376
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
it's it's again just pretty subjective

377
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,880
so you can make you can make

378
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
improvements you can make improvements

379
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,279
to uh to splunk searches but in general

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,480
it's like if i am an analyst responding

381
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
to the results from an alert that i did

382
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,360
not write

383
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,079
is there enough context is there enough

384
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,720
data in the response are the results

385
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,120
actionable for me to be able to respond

386
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,279
to this with no prior knowledge of the

387
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,440
detection that's kind of that's really

388
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,160
the goal of the peer review

389
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,240
yeah um so the question was

390
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,000
um what about validation and unit tests

391
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
so

392
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
in theory

393
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,040
part of it comes from this

394
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
um but when we were talking about actual

395
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
like quality um execution of the

396
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
detection is it running

397
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,880
i mean that's it's that's that's a

398
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,800
gigantic piece of the puzzle um

399
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,839
you get the ability to do this when you

400
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,639
start adhering to a standard or

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,240
framework

402
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,760
is something i talked about a little bit

403
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
in another talk

404
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,079
but in short

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,600
if you make every single detection have

406
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
the exact same shape

407
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
then you're able to perform unit tests

408
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,279
if that makes sense so if you have it in

409
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
a structured object

410
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,800
i told you i want to talk about jira but

411
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
we create a detection issue type and

412
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,440
we use the jira api

413
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,639
we do our incident response in jira

414
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
we track everything there so if there's

415
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,160
a detection

416
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
that is the initial detection thing so

417
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
this has

418
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,639
i'll talked about the ads kind of

419
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,240
strategy has all that

420
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
that propagates to alerts

421
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
those alerts can propagate to an

422
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,279
incident

423
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
so then you have this kind of like like

424
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,399
chain of that

425
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,600
so when it comes to actually like

426
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
executing those um

427
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,519
for us uh i mean like i'm vender

428
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
agnostic like it's just this is the

429
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
technologies we use it's the reality we

430
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,759
use splunk

431
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,519
so um

432
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,279
we built

433
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,560
a pretty big

434
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
cicd pipeline uh to validate every

435
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,959
single search at multiple levels

436
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,360
so we run we execute every single search

437
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
in ci cd to verify that it has no syntax

438
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,120
failures

439
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,079
there's a it's called like a b tool i

440
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,839
think is the splunk command

441
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,199
and that'll actually just

442
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,360
do a top level like configuration check

443
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,399
on everything it'll emit any errors

444
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,959
we also wrote a little tool to execute

445
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,240
the search itself

446
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
just to make sure that it runs

447
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
and then in addition that

448
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
we do daily runs of every single

449
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,959
detection

450
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,040
using something that we call splunk

451
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,240
doctor

452
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
and that looks for things like runtime

453
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,959
number of results

454
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
that is searching through are the fields

455
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,639
still valid

456
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,440
so

457
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,720
it's it's i mean we've invested a lot of

458
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
time into that um

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
i highlight automation is

460
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
pretty much one of the biggest uh

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,959
reasons for our success with this

462
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,399
does that answer your question cool

463
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,480
uh

464
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
it started so it started out as an idea

465
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,359
that we didn't know how we could

466
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,760
accomplish and then uh we brought in an

467
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,799
intern and that's kind of one of the

468
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,240
beauties of of young uh developers

469
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,599
you give them the problems that everyone

470
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,799
else says is impossible and then they

471
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,240
can do it

472
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,120
um so i've i'm encouraging him this year

473
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,840
to work on open source and it got dang

474
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
uh open sourcing is hard

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
when you when you're you know in a

476
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,679
fast-paced like multi-billion dollar

477
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,400
company like it's hard to like stop

478
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
and you know take time just to like open

479
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
source something for everybody else you

480
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
know even if it's good for you if it's

481
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
good for the community it's just hard to

482
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
you know take that time

483
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
um

484
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
come back to that one

485
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,960
cool

486
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,720
all right so as we're going to spend a

487
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
bunch of time

488
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
cool so

489
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
uh before i knew about this before i

490
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,720
heard the term ads we had developed our

491
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,160
own ads

492
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
so we

493
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
me and my me and my boy ashley we got on

494
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,200
a whiteboard for days on end and we just

495
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
whiteboarded forever and we came up with

496
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
our things that were important to us in

497
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,000
a detection palantir

498
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
talks about some of the things and

499
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
reasons why they developed an abs

500
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,280
and

501
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,320
i'm going to highlight the things that

502
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,640
are important here lack of rigor around

503
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
the creation

504
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
sub-optimal alerts going into production

505
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
no documentation

506
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
no peer review

507
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,440
those those are like categorically the

508
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
same issues that we had

509
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
and the reason why we developed what we

510
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,160
did

511
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,919
right you can go check that out it's a

512
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,360
really good starting point and i'll even

513
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,159
talk about it a little bit

514
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
so palantirs ads framework is made up of

515
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,840
these sections okay so if if you are

516
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
creating a detection

517
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,520
this is

518
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
these are the areas and categories that

519
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,320
you must fill out before this goes to

520
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,559
peer review before it goes into your

521
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,039
production pipeline

522
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
so

523
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
what part of the framework is important

524
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
for you and your team

525
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,679
are you short on resources

526
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,440
is it more important that you move

527
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
quickly

528
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,200
as comprehensively as this framework

529
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,679
demands

530
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,600
cool so me i'm a big believer in

531
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
lightweight

532
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
i want i want to go like as light as

533
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
possible so that was why the very first

534
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,720
thing that i did was just strip away

535
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,039
every single thing i could

536
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,400
so

537
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
for me which it is

538
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,880
this is this is this is where i start

539
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
these these are like kind of like the

540
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
most important things

541
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,880
it's pretty amazing what a naming

542
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
convention gets you it's like just

543
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
shockingly amazing

544
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
you have to remember that like you got

545
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
to live with that so you like don't do

546
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
something that you hate

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,799
um you know if you're if if you're

548
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,720
spewing out hundreds of alerts a day hey

549
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,640
that's too many

550
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,240
but b

551
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,080
you gotta you gotta be you gotta be okay

552
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
with the name that you choose what

553
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
should the name

554
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
be

555
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
i say that it's one of the biggest

556
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
quality of life improvements

557
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
naming things is hard

558
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
most of the time not everyone in the

559
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,360
room will like the name that you pick

560
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,760
but it doesn't really matter that much

561
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,840
in general you're not going to make

562
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,120
everyone happy

563
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
what you're aiming for what i believe

564
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,159
that you should try and do when you

565
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
create your own naming convention is

566
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
make it descriptive

567
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,480
i literally named our tool the

568
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
standardizer

569
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,559
like you could call it mega man you

570
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
could call it superman you know there's

571
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
like everyone wants to like have some

572
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
really cool catchy names

573
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
with this for an analyst i mean i i i

574
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
like i i was responding to phishing

575
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
email reports you know just two years

576
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,799
ago i understand very well the mindset

577
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,760
of an analyst right

578
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,520
when you get when you like you get a

579
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,480
deluge of data coming in

580
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,919
if you see something across your face

581
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
like your brain's already like

582
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,200
you know a minute ahead

583
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,640
if you give yourself a name that's

584
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
helpful to you to your brain kick

585
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
starting

586
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,960
that analysis and triage process that's

587
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,159
a win

588
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,720
so make your name descriptive and again

589
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
it yes it matters but it kind of just

590
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
you just got to pick something and do it

591
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,679
so for us it's like we use like a

592
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,039
primary key

593
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,280
we talk about the scope

594
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
we talk about the data source

595
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,480
the miter tactic

596
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,559
and then the short name

597
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,640
so i can i kind of stole like aws is

598
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,400
like double colons

599
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,600
and it's like primary key

600
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
scope

601
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,679
data source

602
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,760
short name so i use a human readable

603
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
name i'll show you this later

604
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
cool

605
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,639
i'll stick to the script

606
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
the documentation of the detection is

607
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,559
very important we have multiple views

608
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,480
for different objectives

609
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,679
so

610
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
talking about detection context

611
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
find the detection author i've created

612
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,880
i've created a detection

613
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
i had this like

614
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,679
my creation view again i told you all

615
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,000
it's in jira this is where we do it we

616
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
also take it and we emit it into

617
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,520
confluence onto like an executive kind

618
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,000
of view we emit it into json it's a

619
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,159
structured object straight out of jira

620
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,159
so i can shove it like anywhere in any

621
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
format that i want

622
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
the reason why this is important

623
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
is because again

624
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,799
you're not always responding to the same

625
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,039
alert that you created and people might

626
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,640
not have any context

627
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
so

628
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
part of that documentation include

629
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
context behind why the detection was

630
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
created

631
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,640
the original author should explain

632
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
motivation general good or bad things

633
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
about the detection how they came to

634
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,720
create the detection that they did

635
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,320
and we capture this all

636
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,120
with

637
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,640
so the per the person that creates this

638
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
they'll like write comments they're like

639
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,679
hey i came into this problem we have

640
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,000
peer review those comments are captured

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,279
so i can go back i can look at

642
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,559
detections that were created two years

643
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,360
ago

644
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
see any improvements

645
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
maintenance changes

646
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,279
conversations that have happened the

647
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,120
entire life cycle of that i can look at

648
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
every single alert that's ever fired for

649
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
that same detection

650
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,320
and look at like commonalities right

651
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,200
the dream for me

652
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,799
is that

653
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,120
you automate and you you like you create

654
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
like a feedback loop between all those

655
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
alerts right to

656
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,480
that they're kind of like aware of each

657
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,919
other

658
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,120
that part's a little harder to get to

659
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,240
and kind of requires a slightly more

660
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
mature program but the idea is like if

661
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,200
you have a thousand results

662
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
for one single alert it's fired over two

663
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
years and you have a thousand different

664
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,360
ones

665
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,279
it's like what can you learn about that

666
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,640
and it's not necessarily like machine

667
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,600
learning

668
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
it's not like data modeling exactly but

669
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,960
what can you learn about that alert

670
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,799
results what can you do to speed up and

671
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,960
reduce the overhead on your analyst

672
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,320
how can you you know prevent them from

673
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,559
getting like alert fatigue as they

674
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,080
triage the same thing over and over and

675
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,879
over and over and over

676
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,400
all right

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
classifying metadata

678
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
classifying the scope of the detection

679
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
so when i say scope what does that mean

680
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,799
it's like workstations aws

681
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,200
server

682
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,480
um

683
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
you know you get more more or less

684
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,960
granular

685
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,880
i think basically my general uh

686
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,000
principle with this is

687
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,000
start small like this

688
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,679
and as you get more stable as you get

689
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,840
more solid with this and this becomes

690
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
easy and you build automation around it

691
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,000
you build like enrichment around it and

692
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
you're able to like build

693
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,720
some reporting some forecasting

694
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
using like just kind of this like small

695
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,520
set then add something

696
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,080
you know i i just now like just like two

697
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
weeks ago this and i've been doing this

698
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,080
like two years with this just detection

699
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,120
program i just added sub capabilities to

700
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
being able to understand how well we're

701
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,840
doing at detecting

702
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,000
stuff

703
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
right whatever whatever the whole cloud

704
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,039
stuff means

705
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,320
and that's it's a really kind of hard

706
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,520
problem but

707
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,600
but basically we're in a good enough

708
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
spot where we're stable enough that all

709
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,400
of a sudden using the word cloud to talk

710
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,840
about what it is we're trying to detect

711
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
isn't necessarily good enough for us

712
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,760
anymore and we have the ability to get

713
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
more granular but we didn't but we

714
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,039
didn't start like that

715
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,320
so my again my recommendation

716
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,879
start small

717
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
if anybody read that one article

718
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,400
that one guy

719
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
talks about the flywheel

720
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,159
i find that i find that really powerful

721
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,279
i made i've made uh incremental

722
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,400
improvements a part of my

723
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,480
kind of mantra and work

724
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,559
for a little while now

725
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,960
all right

726
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
cool so

727
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,400
i talked to you all about the ads that

728
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
was provided by palantir we talked to

729
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
you about some of the kind of like

730
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
short-term things that i would do and so

731
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,360
now i'm going to show you exactly what

732
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,559
i would do in a very mature program

733
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,960
so i wrote a methodology after doing

734
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
this for like two years

735
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,080
i kind of i validated it with

736
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
going to

737
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,559
training conferences and kind of

738
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,159
understanding where everybody else was

739
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,720
at in the industry where we were at

740
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,600
this is what i came up with

741
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
so if you you saw palantirs

742
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,880
um ads you'll see some similarities and

743
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,520
some straight up that have ripped

744
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
um a couple of them we don't even use

745
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,039
yet but this is my theoretical ideal

746
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,480
i'll tell you which one i don't use but

747
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
other than that this is all

748
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,960
uh

749
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
active and like our production

750
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
detection program

751
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,880
goal so it's really important when you

752
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
create a detection what is the text

753
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
detection logic aiming to detect like

754
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,480
it's it might seem straightforward but

755
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,679
you'd be surprised how often you just

756
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
forget to like stay focused

757
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,399
scope

758
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,320
categorization i mean the minor the

759
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
minor tactic it's it's just pretty easy

760
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
like

761
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,120
you could try and roll your own but

762
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
there's not really any reason to

763
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,360
you know

764
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,320
it's

765
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,520
like just use that

766
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,039
um let's see

767
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,640
human readable name cool so i talked

768
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
about this a little bit so we i we do

769
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
have a naming convention

770
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,840
right

771
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,440
but we have a human readable name too

772
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,799
right because

773
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
we we are humans still responding to

774
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,880
this this is pretty important i i cap

775
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
this at 48 characters

776
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,039
just so that you can't like go on

777
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,640
forever

778
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,159
let's get some we get some literary

779
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
types in my my field

780
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,559
cool uh scope you know this is pretty

781
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,880
important so again just for a reminder

782
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,240
refresher what what are we looking at

783
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,159
what like what the hell are these

784
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,679
this is

785
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,279
a detection

786
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
right the the like the splunk logic or

787
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
your snort rule or whatever it is that

788
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,039
you're doing your query language or

789
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,520
python your behavioral analytics

790
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,640
that is a component

791
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,799
of the detection right this is

792
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
this is important to do at a holistic

793
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,279
level

794
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,760
otherwise you're not going to scale

795
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,120
you're not going to forecast where

796
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,080
you're going you're not going to be able

797
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
to see where your blind spots are you're

798
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,080
not going to be able to see where you're

799
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,880
doing good you're not going to be able

800
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,320
to see we have detection coverage you're

801
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,039
going to be able to report up

802
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,240
and your analysts individual

803
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
contributors won't really understand the

804
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,600
big picture of what they're doing

805
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
this is tedious

806
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,240
that's where you use automation to fill

807
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
it up

808
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
remember

809
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,600
this is this is a good starting point

810
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
this is comprehensive

811
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,919
okay

812
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,360
so scope

813
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,520
detecting malicious activity in aws

814
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,000
workstations a product right you have

815
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
your product we have ours

816
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,559
not this is you know it's like i can't

817
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,760
tell you all the products that you're

818
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,679
gonna have in scope and they've got

819
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,880
different types of logs that's important

820
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,960
data source right

821
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
so for a lot of people is just index

822
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
equals network right

823
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,720
it's really just a way to again this

824
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,279
helps understand

825
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,440
for the for the person responding

826
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
what is this detection about they might

827
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
not have written this detection they're

828
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,080
responding to the alert they need to

829
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
know where it's coming from

830
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
strategy abstract

831
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,399
eh

832
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,000
yeah so some people are better at this

833
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,039
than others

834
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,960
like uh i don't know i think i'm kind of

835
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,600
like a street computer guy

836
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,720
i'm like i'm probably not going to be

837
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,559
the best at like your technical context

838
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,159
i'd be like uh yeah you know i'm like

839
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,919
some hackers so i did some stupid stuff

840
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,279
and i think this is pretty bad and this

841
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,880
probably should never happen

842
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,919
uh you know and then some people are

843
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:02,880
going to write to like a like a

844
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
dissertation

845
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,919
so this can be thought of as the

846
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,279
research and development that went into

847
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
learning about the underlying technology

848
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,240
before and while the detection is

849
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,360
developed

850
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
capturing this content is helpful in

851
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,080
bringing the overall knowledge of the

852
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,440
team up

853
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
by sharing technical knowledge and how

854
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,440
the analyst got there you have junior

855
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,399
analysts senior you got whatever

856
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,640
if you if you show people how you came

857
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,960
to the spot that you did your whole team

858
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
comes up

859
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,519
it's it's like no longer tribal

860
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
knowledge

861
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
blind spots this is actually really good

862
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
the reason why i like i i didn't like

863
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,039
the idea of blind spots before because

864
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,799
it just seemed like extra stuff that i

865
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,760
had to do

866
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
but the reason why i like it now is

867
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,720
because it helps you

868
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,880
narrow the scope of your detection

869
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,159
right

870
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,679
you can't create a detection that

871
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
detects everything

872
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,200
and admitting that is great right so

873
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,559
like so what if you have a detection

874
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,159
that looks for it

875
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,919
like the same kind of thing just three

876
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,320
different ways

877
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
it's like so what

878
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,120
yeah you do a little extra work you have

879
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
a little extra stuff going on but but

880
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,679
like admit that you have blind spots

881
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,360
and that's fine and then you're like

882
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
okay this detection is actually a lot

883
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,279
easier to finish

884
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
because i'm not trying to catch

885
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,760
everything i'm trying to catch this part

886
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
and i'm admitting like where this thing

887
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,440
fails so let me create a different one

888
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
which is better at detecting what this

889
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,559
one doesn't

890
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,840
right and that's like that's okay

891
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,519
yeah false positives

892
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,399
i mean come on it's gonna happen

893
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,600
um

894
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
putting these in is good

895
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,519
like so

896
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,880
you create a detection right and you run

897
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,279
it back as far back as your data source

898
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,480
allows

899
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,279
it you know here's your first splunk

900
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,399
trick

901
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,039
bucket bucket your search into like days

902
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,480
or

903
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,519
you know bin span equals four hours and

904
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
then run it back 90 days see how many

905
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,559
times this thing would fire

906
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,279
and if if like

907
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,360
i mean you don't want to say like not

908
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
quote windows.exe

909
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,600
quote necessarily right so

910
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,799
sometimes you just have to leave some

911
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,120
false positives in there and document it

912
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
and then you can you know if if it's

913
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,760
like

914
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,679
consistent and you can like track it

915
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,080
then do some automation post processing

916
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,360
later

917
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,279
to make it easier on your analysts

918
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,519
cool validation test this one i think is

919
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,240
really hard

920
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,519
and it takes a lot of effort from the

921
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,559
individual contributor from the author

922
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
to actually do a good job of this

923
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,960
in addition to that is kind of coming

924
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,840
back to what you're talking about

925
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,360
you have to have um infrastructure

926
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,039
to be able to do this that feeds into

927
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
your reporting pipeline the same way

928
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,960
your production

929
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,159
things that you're already trying to

930
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,519
detect anyway

931
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,679
are feeding up into okay so as an

932
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,039
example

933
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,279
i have a laptop

934
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
it's got crowdstrike it's got oh it's

935
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,359
query it's got silence it's got

936
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,280
everything on it right

937
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,199
so i do something on it and then like

938
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,079
that feeds up into a you know like a aws

939
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,599
kinesis stream

940
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,560
which goes into splunk

941
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,760
if i write a detection and it's like

942
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,399
okay repeat these bad steps

943
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,040
where do i do that

944
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,359
how do i mimic a a workstation

945
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,760
in a repeatable

946
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
way

947
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,639
i mean if it's mac you're talking about

948
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,199
mac os licensing

949
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,960
that sucks

950
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,079
right

951
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,720
so it's hard

952
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,280
what this what this helps with is this

953
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,839
helps with the comprehensive like kind

954
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,520
of like end-to-end

955
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,079
authoring of the detection it provides

956
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,079
you a little more confidence that what

957
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,720
you've created is real

958
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,040
it's not like fairy dust

959
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,720
right

960
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,320
so we we tried we tried once we tried

961
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,599
twice

962
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,320
um to create like kind of a harness that

963
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,920
would

964
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,359
so we would mandate like python or shell

965
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,680
scripts for every single detection to be

966
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,520
repeatable

967
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
that's not very scalable it's pretty

968
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
hard

969
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,119
and requires a lot of edge casing

970
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,920
um so

971
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680
we have we there's another initiative to

972
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,720
try it

973
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,119
which you know i mean keep experimenting

974
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,880
what we decided to invest more time on

975
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,720
than that was the

976
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,079
the health

977
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,320
of these cert of the searches

978
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
make sure that they're running make sure

979
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
that the data source is still there make

980
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,640
sure the data source matches what the

981
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,599
search thinks the data source is right

982
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,160
does the field arn dot principle ip id

983
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
still exist in this data source because

984
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
the search is looking for and without

985
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,839
that field the search is broken

986
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
so if you can

987
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,880
if your environment allows for it if you

988
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,440
can build a harness and a rig to do this

989
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,160
i mean yeah because otherwise the one

990
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
time you get owned we're gonna be like i

991
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,119
thought we had a detection for that and

992
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,960
it's like yeah but that data source

993
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
changed

994
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,879
f

995
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,720
you know that sucks

996
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,079
priority severity this one this one

997
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,280
again i think this one uh

998
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
is for when you're more mature

999
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,880
i don't think that one's that important

1000
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,280
early on

1001
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,920
cool

1002
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
is the last two

1003
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,320
in the alerting and detection strategy

1004
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,520
that we use

1005
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,040
response this is really important

1006
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,400
you know

1007
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,839
it's difficult because a lot of times

1008
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,680
this is like the last thing you do in

1009
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,280
the detection and i mean you might have

1010
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,800
spent two weeks developing this

1011
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,720
detection you've done all this testing

1012
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
you've set up a lab environment

1013
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,480
you know you're like running paku

1014
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,200
against your whole aws environment

1015
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,359
and then it's like okay

1016
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,520
now let me get boring and tell the

1017
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
responder what to do

1018
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,920
but it is it is so important you know

1019
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,960
it's it's a it's a real big bummer

1020
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,359
when you show up to the response steps

1021
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,599
and it's like oh yeah you know whatever

1022
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,599
it's like not cool

1023
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,440
but

1024
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,200
scheduling you know how often this

1025
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,839
happens right

1026
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,160
so

1027
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,079
cool

1028
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,160
so that was

1029
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,520
you know that's kind of like that's

1030
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
really this is really the bread and

1031
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,040
butter of uh

1032
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,839
of the things that have helped

1033
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,440
move us into a mature state

1034
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,640
you know what

1035
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,000
we talked about this is kind of like the

1036
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,119
core

1037
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,560
you know

1038
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
go watch go watch the other talk uh on

1039
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,280
the standardizer to to kind of like

1040
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
understand how this fits into automation

1041
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,040
and tooling

1042
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
but this

1043
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,599
doing this is really elevated us a lot

1044
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,200
consistently mandating and enforcing all

1045
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,720
of this

1046
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
cool so now i'm just going to talk about

1047
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,640
some more high-level stuff

1048
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,599
yeah

1049
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,000
get me

1050
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,520
of this is yeah in like fun books and

1051
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,839
you know for each of those

1052
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,599
alerts that you're creating

1053
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,320
um how much of that is paper on paper or

1054
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,640
your digital paper for the team to

1055
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,200
really learn from or are they just

1056
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,440
constantly being updated

1057
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,720
how much of a library is there for you

1058
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
guys

1059
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
uh yeah uh everything every single one

1060
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,000
has a runbook every single detection has

1061
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,079
a runbook every single one has a runbook

1062
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
all right

1063
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,000
so

1064
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,320
how do you do this

1065
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
so you have like an idea right okay i'm

1066
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,440
just gonna tell y'all how we do it

1067
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,000
we do detection cycles we do this for a

1068
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,560
reason uh because we we have a pretty

1069
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
flat structure a lot of y'all will not

1070
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,760
have a flat structure

1071
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,040
um

1072
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
but basically we do it in four week

1073
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,240
chunks

1074
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
so we say

1075
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
for this four weeks we're going to focus

1076
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,480
on the miter tactic

1077
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
lateral movement because

1078
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,119
we have been able to identify through

1079
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,200
all the categorization and like i mean

1080
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,480
that's that's the eth and beauty of this

1081
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,240
right you start doing this at a

1082
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,079
structured level you start scaling yeah

1083
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,359
you start with one detection that

1084
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,560
doesn't do much for you but you have a

1085
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,599
hundred

1086
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,440
two hundred three hundred and all of a

1087
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,560
sudden you know

1088
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
where

1089
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,240
your weaker spots are where you don't

1090
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,000
have detection coverage and you know you

1091
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
can go into like a three-dimensional

1092
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,720
matrix

1093
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,680
so

1094
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,560
we determined we do not have

1095
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,480
detection coverage

1096
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,520
on aws

1097
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,160
metadata in point

1098
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,960
right

1099
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,400
or like aws access and identity right so

1100
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
that's a bigger topic

1101
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,040
so for four weeks we focus on that

1102
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,560
and then after we know that then we move

1103
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,759
to a different area okay

1104
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,480
so

1105
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,920
at the beginning before the four-week

1106
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,119
cycle begins

1107
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,280
we get together we talk about it

1108
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,119
and sometimes we're like

1109
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,040
we're like this is where we forecasted

1110
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
where we see that we're not doing good

1111
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,960
and this is where we think we should be

1112
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,599
somebody else have any ideas

1113
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,200
and then we talk about potential areas

1114
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
where we could

1115
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,000
and then

1116
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,839
break it down

1117
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,680
break down and let people talk and it's

1118
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,119
it's a good way especially right now in

1119
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,800
the kind of virtual working environment

1120
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,160
to do this so what areas are they most

1121
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,319
concerned about where can they write

1122
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,680
detections

1123
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,879
do you have windows in your environment

1124
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,480
cool

1125
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,599
so

1126
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,280
you brainstorm you have a pretty good

1127
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
idea of like what you're going to do so

1128
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
you actually kick off i know it's like

1129
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
look i'm like the least i used to be the

1130
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,160
least process oriented person i was

1131
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,720
telling doug i used to not like jira

1132
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,319
there's something wrong with me

1133
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,359
um

1134
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,119
i like it now

1135
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,680
um but

1136
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,359
kickoff so

1137
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,440
so you brainstorm

1138
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,880
and then you move forward and you say

1139
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
all right now we're gonna start this

1140
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
week

1141
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,440
john what are you working on

1142
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
danny what are you working on emily what

1143
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,079
are you working on ayla what are you

1144
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,040
working on

1145
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,240
what are you gonna what are you gonna

1146
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,520
try

1147
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,280
and everyone agrees this is what we're

1148
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
gonna do

1149
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,240
so they start

1150
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
and then we do a mid-cycle check-in

1151
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,599
so

1152
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,480
what we found early was

1153
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,839
sometimes after four weeks people would

1154
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,720
be like i was struggling a lot

1155
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,200
and i i couldn't figure it out i was

1156
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,440
like oh man we should have talked to you

1157
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,480
well

1158
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,200
okay so just like make it happen

1159
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,960
so start doing the mid-cycle checkpoint

1160
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,200
so what we do is we partner people up

1161
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,040
we have them review each other's

1162
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
detections have them talk about like

1163
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,319
where they're struggling and then they

1164
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,720
present to the broader audience

1165
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
and they say okay this is what this is

1166
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
what danny was working on and this is

1167
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,920
where they think they might have some

1168
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,680
struggles and then you kind of like

1169
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,440
bring that tribal knowledge

1170
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,319
in

1171
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,960
and people that might know something

1172
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,359
can help bring those forward or

1173
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
scrap it

1174
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,800
because like ideally you want a

1175
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,079
deliverable right

1176
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,119
cool

1177
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,760
all right this was this was one of mine

1178
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,839
it started going this went pretty well i

1179
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,800
i started this with the idea of um

1180
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,359
it being for incident response

1181
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,200
as in

1182
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,280
we don't know about some product we've

1183
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,040
never worked with it but if it gets

1184
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,280
breached we're on the lam you know what

1185
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,040
i mean so

1186
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,520
i put someone on it for two weeks three

1187
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,680
weeks they go talk to the team they go

1188
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,119
talk to the developers they go talk to

1189
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,640
the service owners

1190
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,720
and they build out a breach readiness

1191
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
document

1192
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,280
which

1193
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,960
includes like

1194
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,520
if this product gets owned tomorrow who

1195
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
do i contact who do i reach out to who's

1196
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,040
my first point of contact who's the best

1197
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,839
like

1198
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,200
engineer developer that's going to be

1199
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,359
able to answer all these questions

1200
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,119
because like it's not like it's you know

1201
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,240
it's kind of like the illusion of

1202
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,520
randomness

1203
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,680
it's going to happen right

1204
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
so diagrams architecture tribal

1205
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,640
knowledge so you interview the

1206
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,800
developers you ask them

1207
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,040
yes the developers like skeletons in the

1208
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,760
closet or like your war game

1209
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
like find out what it is that scares

1210
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,960
them

1211
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
and then like literally document the log

1212
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,880
sources

1213
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
you'd be surprised like how many log

1214
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,520
stores there are that nobody's ever

1215
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,119
looked at ever

1216
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,280
that exists and that can help you or are

1217
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,079
totally worthless

1218
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,839
and then what have you already done or

1219
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,599
what have other teams already done you

1220
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,200
have a product security team you know if

1221
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,720
you have an application security team

1222
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,200
what have they done with this

1223
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,560
team that you don't know anything about

1224
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,560
maybe they have some embedded engineers

1225
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,160
maybe they have maybe they emit some

1226
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,720
special log that is like warning warning

1227
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,560
this should never happen

1228
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
you know like seriously like

1229
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,680
it'd be a bummer if you found that out

1230
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,400
like

1231
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,040
way afterwards

1232
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,119
so some of the benefits from this

1233
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,760
mean time to resolution goes down

1234
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,200
clarity

1235
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
you know again this is about this is

1236
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,240
about

1237
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,160
helping helping the overhead on your

1238
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,920
analysts as they respond to stuff it's

1239
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,319
going to cut time down

1240
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,599
i've only got a little bit of time left

1241
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,960
so i'm going to try and blow through

1242
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,560
this

1243
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,079
this so again this started out as

1244
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,440
incident response

1245
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,920
driven but this is now we use this for

1246
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,760
detections as well so

1247
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,400
this gives us a whole lot of fuel to

1248
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,920
write detections for

1249
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,680
turns out understanding the architecture

1250
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,520
better understanding the threats to

1251
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,440
privilege and paths privileged data and

1252
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,960
knowing what the log sources are these

1253
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,119
are also all good precursors to being

1254
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,400
able to write detections for something

1255
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240
that you didn't know about

1256
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,000
cool

1257
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,119
you might have been able you might be

1258
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,480
able to see

1259
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
how i was feeling at the time that i

1260
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,799
wrote the tech reference

1261
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,560
this is just like a random smattering of

1262
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,920
stuff this is the stuff that just came

1263
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,480
top of mind

1264
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,240
um you can ask me about any of these

1265
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,959
later if you want

1266
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,280
and

1267
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,599
boom

1268
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,560
and it's 10 49 i think we have like you

1269
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,560
know maybe time for any questions if

1270
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,040
anybody wants

1271
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,599
uh

1272
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,680
i mean it sounds like you're using

1273
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,079
splunk 4 and just yeah you've built your

1274
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,520
own pipelines recent management

1275
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,040
workflows and all that stuff

1276
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,200
um is there any you know be evaluated

1277
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,640
and out of the box releasements or some

1278
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,480
of that um and you do it all in the same

1279
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,760
tool like

1280
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,400
security yeah right

1281
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,119
yeah um

1282
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,040
how do i how do i how do i defer this

1283
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,839
question

1284
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,160
i think that

1285
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,880
it was kind of a constant debate between

1286
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,200
build versus buy

1287
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,359
and

1288
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,359
i you know to be honest like sometimes

1289
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:00,079
you make the decision to build

1290
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,920
um when you maybe could have made the

1291
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,079
decision to buy i think the the

1292
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,119
leadership

1293
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,599
um basically has a lot of influence on

1294
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,000
that their personal experiences with it

1295
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,440
in the past

1296
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,880
how much they liked it what they think

1297
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,680
you can actually get out of it

1298
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,119
one of the one of the

1299
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,560
i would say one of the most difficult

1300
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,920
things

1301
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,720
is procuring software and then

1302
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,680
demonstrating a lot of usage of it you

1303
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,839
know sometimes you precursor and then it

1304
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,520
sits in a closet for

1305
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,280
six months before anybody even touches

1306
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,000
it

1307
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,240
um

1308
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,960
i you know it's uh kind of kind of tough

1309
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,200
to answer um

1310
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,960
people have brought it up a few times

1311
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,880
about enterprise security um

1312
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,559
i guess i guess that we just kind of

1313
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,319
took case management

1314
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,440
internal and we decided to build

1315
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,920
because we had enough uh

1316
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,720
we had enough experience on splunk

1317
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,559
yeah

1318
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,240
that's i mean yeah i'm just i'm just

1319
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,920
trying to think it out loud with you

1320
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,960
that's there's because there's no

1321
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,119
there's not like any like real easy

1322
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,520
answer to that i mean we we talk it's a

1323
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,119
it's a constant discussion point you

1324
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,559
know it's like maybe we should stop

1325
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,319
trying to build everything

1326
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,640
i mean i've talked to several

1327
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,720
people in your position who

1328
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,880
have built up all of their own you know

1329
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,960
all

1330
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,319
we're starting to do that more right now

1331
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,160
um i think it's a matter of scaling

1332
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,440
so

1333
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,880
i'm looking at architects across the

1334
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,720
entire company

1335
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,000
and

1336
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,680
one of the challenges i have is creating

1337
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,400
a

1338
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,400
standard template for application

1339
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
logging for operating system logging for

1340
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,839
operational logging

1341
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,839
have you had to get down to that level

1342
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,839
and develop it yeah and say here's the

1343
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,839
standard

1344
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,520
yeah yeah

1345
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,200
this question was about

1346
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,680
logging standards um

1347
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,400
i

1348
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,640
on the agenda i think at one point i had

1349
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
logging written down there and then i

1350
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
was like nah i'm not i'm not gonna touch

1351
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,520
this

1352
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,960
um

1353
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
it just it's you know

1354
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,119
it's it's an arduous problem

1355
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,280
to overcome um

1356
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,760
it's i think it's in the similar boat as

1357
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,040
uh like the

1358
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,760
naming convention in that

1359
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,920
you just make a decision and then that's

1360
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,359
it you stick to it

1361
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,680
you know like like the sim

1362
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,680
like splunk cim i think that's the

1363
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,440
common information model that's a pretty

1364
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,280
good starting point you know it covers

1365
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,079
like a decent amount um the hard part is

1366
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,240
like retroactively getting a bunch of

1367
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,559
developers to change code uh you know

1368
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,880
i'm like damn

1369
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,559
you know who are you to to tell them how

1370
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,760
to do that

1371
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,920
yeah i said no it's it's it's hard uh

1372
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,599
you know i think it's a pretty big

1373
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,680
problem across the board

1374
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,280
sorry that i don't have a better answer

1375
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,800
for you

1376
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,839
yeah basically we've dedicated

1377
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,119
we're going to dedicate an entire team

1378
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,960
to creating logging standards

1379
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,079
you need like a lot of resources to do

1380
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,280
it i think

1381
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,559
effectively

1382
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,880
you know

1383
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,400
bueno

1384
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,240
stabian muchas gracias thank you

1385
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,240
everybody
