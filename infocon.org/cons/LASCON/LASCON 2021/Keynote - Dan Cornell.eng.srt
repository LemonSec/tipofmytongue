1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
uh yeah so today i wanted to talk about

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,039
things i've been wrong about uh in in

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,599
the application security space

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
um now as uh you know as

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,279
as i'll talk a little bit more about um

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,800
i'm at a point now where i have to say

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,559
that these opinions don't necessarily

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
reflect those of my employer

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
um you know recently uh you know coal

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
fire acquired denver in june of this

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,520
year

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,719
which i'm

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,000
very excited about i think all our

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
team's very excited about um but that's

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,160
this is something i could really say

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
you know with like with being a closely

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
held private company uh you know with

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
like two business partners uh you know

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
it was harder to separate my opinion

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,879
from

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,320
you know what would be perceived as a

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
corporate pronouncement so you know if i

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,319
go off on some kind of crazy nazi rant

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,840
shared and can't be like dan cornell you

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
know i hadn't really heard of that guy

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
you know like

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,640
but now

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
now i think that is important to say is

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
uh

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
uh you know again i'm speaking as dan

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
cornell as myself here not as a

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
representative coal fire uh in fact i i

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
don't actually even think that they know

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
i'm here

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,040
well

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
um hopefully from the quality of my

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,119
slides though everybody can believe that

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
the marketing department has had no hand

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
whatsoever uh you know in in the

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,799
development of this uh of this talk

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,720
um a little bit of background and like

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,640
one thing i love about last con is

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
there's a lot of friendly faces um you

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
know again no no a lot of folks here um

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
and that's fantastic but uh for folks

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
that don't necessarily know me um i was

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
one of the founders and the cto of

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
denham group back at the end of 2001

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
and we were you know or denim group was

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
an oauth participant since the first

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,439
oasp apsec the one that was in at that

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,880
university in new jersey i think it was

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
2003

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,520
so in the application security space

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,599
for a long time um i've had the

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,720
opportunity to you know speak at a lot

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
of oauth events at rsa at the black hat

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
sizzle forum tedx

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
i'm really excited uh i mean i'm honored

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,720
to have the opportunity to give uh this

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,480
keynote today at last con because again

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,000
last con is a conference that i always

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,200
have always enjoyed uh participating in

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
um and

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
after the acquisition of denver by coal

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
fire now i'm the vice president of

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,959
product strategy at coal fire so still

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,200
you know actively engaged

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,640
and that's i think an important thing to

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
note you know i'm i'm still working i'm

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
still you know doing application

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
security stuff helping organizations

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
solve hard application uh you know

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,959
security problems this isn't some kind

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,519
of a you know goodbye cruel world talk

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
about you know kind of a mic drop

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
exiting the application security space

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
um you know but i do find myself at a at

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,120
a you know situation after running denim

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
group for 20 years and now going through

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,560
this this transition you know when you

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,239
work on something for 20 years you

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,239
accomplish an important goal it's a i

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
mean it's a

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
it re it's reasonable to have some time

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
for reflection um you know both you know

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
to look at what we did as a team you

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,680
know as well as what i did as an

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
individual and how that contributed

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
uh to it

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
um

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
and people love to talk about what went

93
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
right

94
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
and there's i think this is an xkc xkcd

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,159
cartoon that i've cribbed you know where

96
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
you get to a point and you look back and

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,959
say

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
like oh okay look at these waypoints

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
along the way that have this like

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
straight line of you know where i

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
started to where i'm at right now and

102
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
you can you know push a narrative back

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,560
on what happened um

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
but that's you know that's not

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
necessarily the way you know that

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
doesn't reflect reality it's not even

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,040
not necessarily that in no circumstance

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,239
that i've ever seen does that actually

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,200
reflect uh reality and

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
there's a lot less discussion of what

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
didn't go well

112
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
along the way and there's a lot less

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,120
discussion of mistakes

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,840
but

115
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
and i think there's a problem with that

116
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
because you end up with these like

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
articles of like you know here's the

118
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,439
five things that steve jobs did you know

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,760
to make him successful like well number

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,079
one like statistically speaking i feel

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
very comfortable saying that there's the

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
next steve jobs is not in this room

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
right now

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,199
right

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
you know but also again going back and

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
looking only at the things that were

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
successful like that

128
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,759
you know that doesn't necessarily bring

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,360
in the context of why was it successful

130
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
would this have been successful in

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,199
another uh area you know what what

132
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
mistakes led up to getting to uh you

133
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
know this success or to doing things

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
better and i've always tried to take the

135
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,800
attitude of you know not win or lose

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,000
right where hey we've got something that

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
we're doing and it's either going to

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
turn out great or it's going to turn out

139
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,120
wrong right i try to take the view of

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,080
win or learn right and so either you're

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
either you win and you get what you want

142
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
which which is great i mean that's why

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,040
you wanted it in the first place

144
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
um

145
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,479
but if you you know if if you find out

146
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,080
that you're wrong or you made mistakes

147
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
it's important to reflect on those and

148
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
you know there's another thing if you're

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
if you're if you're always right or

150
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
never finding out that you're wrong then

151
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
you're probably not taking um

152
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
you're probably not taking enough risks

153
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,000
you're probably being too comfortable

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
and so

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
um you know i've always tried to make

156
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,280
mistakes but always try to make

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
different and better mistakes and that's

158
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
one of the things that i knew from

159
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
running a company and i'm sure for those

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
of you that run teams

161
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
uh you know just like crazy stuff

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,360
happens right like having employees just

163
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
like wacky stuff happens you've got

164
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
clients you're working with and just

165
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
like crazy things happen and it seems

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,080
like always

167
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
uh you know when looking at running

168
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
teams and looking at uh those types of

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
things there's always this chaos right

170
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
because things are going wrong because

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,840
you know i i made bad decisions people

172
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
underneath me made bad decisions

173
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
whatever that might be

174
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,960
that's just kind of the nature of the

175
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
world all right is nothing ever works

176
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,479
right

177
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
but something that i have always tried

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
to do is to

179
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
learn from those mistakes and to make

180
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
new and more interesting mistakes

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,759
uh

182
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,280
you know with with the new opportunities

183
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,560
that are presented to me and so that's

184
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
kind of the spirit of

185
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
you know

186
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
the the kind of like thoughts that i put

187
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
together today

188
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
uh yo here's the great you know rumsfeld

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,759
quote about like known knowns known

190
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,120
unknowns and unknown unknowns right um

191
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,400
yeah i suppose that's technically

192
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
correct or we could like draw that out

193
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,520
in a formal proof or something like that

194
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
which is which is fantastic

195
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
um but when i think about this it's more

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,240
of the mark twain quote of you know it's

197
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
not like the things that you don't know

198
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
uh aren't the ones that are necessarily

199
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
going to be the most damaging right you

200
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
know and that's the case in application

201
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
security what do we you know

202
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
we're trying to learn right there's

203
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,520
unknown things

204
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
that we're trying to understand what's

205
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
the security state of this application

206
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
does this authentication authorization

207
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,160
behave the way that we think it does

208
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
right if you don't know and you're

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
asking questions like that's good

210
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
because that means you've got space to

211
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,720
progress into

212
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
the things that really hurt you are the

213
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
assumptions that you've made or the

214
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
things that you are convinced are true

215
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,160
but but that actually aren't because

216
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
then that causes you to behave in ways

217
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
that are you know counter to ultimately

218
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,199
being successful

219
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
and uh you know so if you're if you're

220
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
assuming like yeah i know that our

221
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
authentication routines are secure right

222
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
like i i i know that we've got input

223
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
validation across the application right

224
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,039
it's those assumptions that you make

225
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
where you're certain of things

226
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
where you don't have curiosity or you're

227
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
not open to any doubt is where you run

228
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,919
into problems and so yeah i want to talk

229
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,199
about some things in the application

230
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
security space that i used to think were

231
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
correct but that i no longer do

232
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
and then probably more importantly i

233
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
want to look at some reasons why i think

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
i was wrong and

235
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,440
so thing number one and this is the this

236
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
is the big one is right thinking

237
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
organizations are going to do

238
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,160
application security because it's the

239
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
right thing to do right so audience

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,479
participation time all things being

241
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,280
equal who would rather be more secure

242
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,440
versus less secure who wants more secure

243
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
of course who wants less secure

244
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,800
right

245
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
right yeah so obviously obviously who

246
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,800
wouldn't want to be more secure right

247
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
like that is you know that's that's uh

248
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
that's a better thing right but the

249
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
hinge there is that all things being

250
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,720
equal we'll talk about that

251
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
the challenge is i think that a lot of

252
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
the talk around application security has

253
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
been uh almost a good hygiene kind of a

254
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
talk right like everyone should shower

255
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,399
once per day right

256
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
but you don't have to shower once per

257
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,880
day right anyone who's been to defcon

258
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,679
will

259
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
presumably agree with me

260
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,320
right it is it is a global good if you

261
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,399
shower once per day but there's not a

262
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,200
requirement right nobody can make you

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
nobody can make you shower once per day

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
and that's a real challenge that i think

265
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
that i've heard i know with a lot of

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,160
arguments that i've made with

267
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,839
organizations hey why should we care

268
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
about application and software security

269
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,360
right why should we you know take action

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
on this i'm like well you know you don't

271
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
want to be

272
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
like not secure you don't have

273
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
vulnerabilities in your code do you

274
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,959
right and the answer of course is well

275
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,160
of course i don't but that's not really

276
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
a justification

277
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
you know there's good these good hygiene

278
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
arguments for security i don't think are

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
super effective or compelling

280
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,279
you know building security in is a it's

281
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,560
great advice on how to run a software

282
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
security program right ultimately i

283
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
think you end up with better security

284
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
you get it earlier in the process it you

285
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
know long term it's going to be cheaper

286
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,519
like building security in is great

287
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,760
advice on how to run a software security

288
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
program but it's terrible advice on why

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
to run a software security program and i

290
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,959
i found that myself would like i made

291
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
far too many arguments that assumed that

292
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,399
everybody would want to have a certain

293
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,640
level of security and would be willing

294
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,360
to

295
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
exchange sufficient resources for that

296
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,040
i'd like to note that i called like

297
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,320
during that right for this slide i'm

298
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
calling it software security rather than

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
application security in honor of dr gary

300
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,519
mcgraw

301
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,839
he's always made a point software versus

302
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,279
app security

303
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,560
you know and this goes back you know i

304
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
saw this behavior myself this kind of a

305
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
classic entrepreneurial mistake right of

306
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
of like hey i want something and think

307
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
of how much money i'll make if the world

308
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
behaves the way that i want them to

309
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
right uh i prior to denim group i ran a

310
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,720
another startup called brand defense

311
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,519
right

312
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
and uh and it was a total failure we

313
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,160
rammed it in the ground at high speed

314
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
um

315
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,760
and what we did what we did at brand

316
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
defense is we went out and found

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,000
copyright and trademark violations right

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
so organizations have you know

319
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,360
copyrighted materials they trademark you

320
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
know for branding purposes we would go

321
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,680
out and find those violations and we

322
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
could generate all the dmca take down

323
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
paperwork right and i think everybody

324
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
would agree copyright and trademark

325
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
infringement is bad right

326
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,720
right i mean you know for the most part

327
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
there's uh you know some you know uh you

328
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
know eff arguments and whatnot on on the

329
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
margins but in general you shouldn't

330
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,079
steal people's copyrighted material you

331
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,680
should not misuse their trademarks

332
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
hopefully that's uh something that we

333
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
can largely agree on

334
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
you know but what we found was

335
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
we were solving a problem that the

336
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,320
organization didn't know they had

337
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,200
right

338
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,959
and it was a problem they were going to

339
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,800
have to solve with

340
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
budget that they hadn't allocated and

341
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
most importantly it was a problem that

342
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
they were going to have to solve with

343
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
people power right like they were going

344
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
to have to put

345
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
employees or staff on solving this

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
problem

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
right

348
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
and so while we said like hey you don't

349
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
want copyright and trademark violations

350
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,680
and everybody would say like you're

351
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
correct i don't want infringements of

352
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
our trademarks and copyrights right but

353
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
then we said cool for the low price of

354
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,959
whatever we're charging plus this plus

355
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,279
this you can solve that like okay well

356
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,320
that's that's not a trade-off that we're

357
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
super interested in making

358
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,240
and uh you know and and so we had a

359
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
meeting with uh with with our investors

360
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
and we said hey we've identified the 500

361
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
companies that we uh think are most uh

362
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
applicable to the service we've got the

363
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
name of the person to talk to it like

364
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
480 of them we've talked to 450 of these

365
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
people we've run 75 live demos where we

366
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
find these violations and generate the

367
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
paperwork and we have one paying

368
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,120
customer and their cfo was our cfo at my

369
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,839
first startup and

370
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,519
uh and uh yeah and graham weston was one

371
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,279
of our investors uh was you know in the

372
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
original uh invest rackspace you know

373
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
super super great guy you know it you

374
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,959
know sits and he's thoughtful for a

375
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,580
minute and he says

376
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,000
[Music]

377
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
i'm not sure the world is ready for what

378
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
we're doing

379
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
for what we're doing here

380
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
uh and uh and that was a nice way of

381
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
saying that you know we had an idea that

382
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
wasn't uh you know was wasn't destined

383
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,720
to work out so we returned money to the

384
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
investors and whatnot

385
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
and you know it turns out application

386
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
security in a lot of cases is the same

387
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,680
way right everybody would prefer to be

388
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
secure right nobody wants to like have

389
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
security vulnerabilities

390
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,079
but

391
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,000
those development organizations also

392
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
have to deliver software on time and on

393
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,920
budget and so in a lot of cases other

394
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,480
priorities take precedence because it's

395
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
not just a case of like do you want

396
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
secure applications or not it's a

397
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
question of what resources are you going

398
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,760
to allocate to security that then can't

399
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
be allocated in other areas and i think

400
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
that's something that i certainly that

401
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
broadly the app security industry for a

402
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
long time failed to recognize and i know

403
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
that that's something that fed into my

404
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,600
thinking as well

405
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
and that made you know me a less

406
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
effective communicator you know me a

407
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
less effective ambassador for the idea

408
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
of application so and software security

409
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,240
because you know again allocating

410
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,839
resources in one place means they can't

411
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,240
be used in another you know this is also

412
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,120
true for vulnerability remediation right

413
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
you know fixing vulnerabilities uh you

414
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,920
know in in my head or in my thinking for

415
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,959
a long time where you got these

416
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,079
vulnerabilities you got to fix them

417
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
because security is the most important

418
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
thing but the problem is that fixing

419
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
vulnerabilities isn't free those cost

420
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
story points

421
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
that have to be allocated to security

422
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,800
and are thereby not allocated to

423
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,480
non-security related bugs that are

424
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,399
impacting customer experience uh

425
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
performance enhancements uh non-security

426
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
technical debt uh oh yeah and new

427
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,760
features right like the uh

428
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
like the the the drug that all you know

429
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
that all product teams are addicted to

430
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
is new features right and those are the

431
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
ones that are out again driving new uh

432
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,800
new business and and i think that

433
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
you know i avoided this to a large

434
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
degree but i think the industry in a lot

435
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,600
of cases you meet these security

436
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
curmudgeons right where they have this

437
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
perception that developers don't care

438
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,399
about security i remember giving a talk

439
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
at an issa meeting and you know somebody

440
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
in the back said like oh if those like

441
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
you know stupid developers would just

442
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
care about security like all this would

443
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
be like not a problem and i was like you

444
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,959
are fun at parties sir like this is

445
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
um

446
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
you know i i don't have that perception

447
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,920
right but but but i think i i at least

448
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
didn't take it to that extreme but i

449
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
think other folks in the security space

450
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
do whereas there's this perception that

451
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
the developers don't care about security

452
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
organizations don't care about security

453
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
right but again it's important to

454
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,720
understand these trade-offs

455
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
you know and and i had a i i had a very

456
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
i've had a very good lesson in this uh

457
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,079
not specifically security related uh but

458
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
there is a there's a woman named carla

459
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,079
that runs the success team for thread

460
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,839
fix like one of the one of the dev teams

461
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
for the our thread fix platform uh and

462
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
she's tremendous she just won a globey

463
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
2021 women in business in the

464
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
professions world award which is uh

465
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
a great honor for her i mean reflects

466
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,839
the you know just tremendous things that

467
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,120
she's done in her career she started as

468
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
an intern is now you know a team lead

469
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,399
right

470
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,199
uh

471
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
but but one of the best things about

472
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,880
hers is that she's pragmatic right

473
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
and yeah so we we have these

474
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,639
conversations where i'm like hey carla

475
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
can i get an engineer to look into this

476
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,920
thing that i'm interested in just for a

477
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,199
little bit hey carla can i borrow an

478
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,560
engineer for a while i need to get some

479
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
estimates on this stuff hey carla can i

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,079
borrow an engineer to prototype this

481
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
thing that i need a little help on

482
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,199
and

483
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,880
and she gives me a look

484
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,759
that

485
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,079
at the same time indicates that she is

486
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,800
the most patient individual on the

487
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,160
entire earth

488
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
and then i'm the stupidest human that

489
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,920
she's ever met

490
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
in her entire life right because her

491
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,600
question is like

492
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,959
you know cool

493
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,320
where are we moving the release date to

494
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,519
i'm like well we can't move the release

495
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,240
date she's like right then we can't task

496
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,759
engineers to do the stuff that you want

497
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,720
them to do

498
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
they're gonna do the stuff that i have

499
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,079
them tasked to do right and that's i

500
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,079
think a critical thing there's 24 hours

501
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,639
in the day people can only work so much

502
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,240
and doing one thing means that you can't

503
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,079
do another right not just security

504
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
related

505
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,399
and

506
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,320
that's something that i've failed to

507
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
understand a lot where i was always

508
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,759
assuming well let's just layer on like

509
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
one more security task or why can't we

510
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,279
you know why can't we put you know this

511
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
type of analysis in the ci cd pipeline

512
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,800
it's like well i mean the automation

513
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
runs for free but then somebody's got to

514
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,440
own what comes out on the other end of

515
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,639
that like somebody's got to triage the

516
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,279
false positives right and and so that's

517
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,120
a challenge that

518
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,360
i for a long time failed to understand

519
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
is these security tasks consume

520
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
resources and those resources can't be

521
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
used somewhere else and so this blanket

522
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,160
argument of like hey everybody should

523
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,839
just do application security doesn't

524
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,559
yeah it doesn't work really well

525
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
you know so why do companies do

526
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
application security right i think you

527
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,400
need to look at incentives right this is

528
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,319
capitalism that we live in

529
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,119
firms don't do things just because right

530
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,919
firms do things because they expect to

531
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
get a return on an investment of those

532
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,480
resources and that's something again

533
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
that eluded my perspective for a long

534
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
time and so one question that i i would

535
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,640
ask folks if you have if you were a

536
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
software dev team manager right or a

537
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,480
product group manager and you had two

538
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
dev teams working for you one that wrote

539
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,120
perfectly secure code but always just

540
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
blew through deadlines and could not get

541
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
anything out even close to being on time

542
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
and you had another team that wrote bad

543
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,160
code but always hit their deadlines

544
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
every day all day like which dev team

545
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
would you want building out your product

546
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
right we're in the security conference

547
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,679
right now like who who wants the

548
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,760
perfectly secure team that can't hit a

549
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
deadline a couple folks who wants the

550
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
team that gets stuff done but leaves a

551
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
bunch of technical debt in their weight

552
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
right

553
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
yeah if you asked this question at a

554
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,840
non-security conference there would be

555
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
zero hands up for that first team right

556
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
and that's something again that i've

557
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
failed to understand for a long time but

558
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
i think is really critical is to

559
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
understand what is the

560
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
incentive that organizations have to do

561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
application security stuff

562
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
uh you know is it breaches yeah breaches

563
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
cause pain and pain causes changes in

564
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
behavior right and so what we've seen is

565
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
breaches cause at least temporarily

566
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,600
changes in organizations behavior right

567
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
you know this doesn't necessarily last

568
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
forever right but it is an impetus for

569
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,679
behavior changes in a number of

570
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,280
organizations

571
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
all right compliance

572
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
right like one of the first you'll kind

573
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,799
of see changes i saw in the application

574
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,440
security industry is when the pci dss

575
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,120
added in like hey you need to train

576
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
developers on security topics and you

577
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
need to either be doing you know

578
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
application testing or you need to have

579
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
a waf in place right that changed

580
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
behavior right and why did it change

581
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
behavior it changed behavior because

582
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,360
there was the threat of if you don't do

583
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
these things if your pci auditor won't

584
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
sign off on your practices you're going

585
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
to lose the ability to take credit card

586
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
transactions right and

587
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
you know again

588
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,280
you you might survive a breach right and

589
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
as we've seen most organizations do it

590
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
doesn't have a long-term impact on the

591
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
stock price right you know organizations

592
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,919
survive breaches they don't survive

593
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,799
not being able to take money right

594
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,720
and so again

595
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
as these compliance requirements get

596
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,160
layered in what we've seen you know

597
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
explicitly with like pci and fedramp

598
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
implied in in other compliance regimes

599
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
and we see that that changes

600
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
organizations behavior right uh you know

601
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,480
similar to this regulations uh who

602
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
here's big fans of software development

603
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
software bills of material everybody

604
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
great uh really really cool uh concept

605
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
uh you know you see the talk in the

606
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,720
executive order that came out of the

607
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
biden administration talking about these

608
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
things um you know owasp with uh you

609
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,120
know steve springett's dependency track

610
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
a fantastic oauth tool to help you track

611
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
these software bills and materials

612
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,200
and so everybody here should either be

613
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
getting ready depending on your role to

614
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
either ask for uh software builds

615
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,280
materials from your suppliers or to

616
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,400
provide them to your customers right and

617
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
honestly i think as an industry like

618
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,320
literally this is the least we can do

619
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
right now hey you sold me some software

620
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,440
cool what's in the software right if you

621
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,159
get like the two shoulder salute like

622
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
that's a bad answer

623
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,600
right and that's uh you know it's kind

624
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
of like the story about the it was the

625
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,480
rolling stone that was a uh

626
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,799
it was a van halen where they had the

627
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
concert writer that said like you have

628
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,120
to like you know no or only green m m's

629
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,960
or no brown m m's or whatever it is

630
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,880
right and that was a check though right

631
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
to go in and see well hey did they read

632
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,760
the writer no they've got normal like

633
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,320
normal bag of m ms okay well did they do

634
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,679
all the other stuff that they needed to

635
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,360
do for the rigging and the stage and you

636
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,400
know to be able to handle loads and

637
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
stuff like that so it's a tell right so

638
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
if you're looking at an organization and

639
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
you ask hey can you provide a software

640
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
bill of materials and they say like

641
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,640
like that's a good indicator like what

642
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,080
you know what what practices do they

643
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,360
have in place that they can't even

644
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
answer these you know simple questions

645
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,720
for us

646
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,320
you know another huge thing has been

647
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,919
customer pressure you know and i

648
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,520
actually first had this realization at

649
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
last con in the expo area i can't

650
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
remember what year is a number of years

651
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
ago

652
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
but i first had this realization where

653
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
you know from talking to different folks

654
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
the biggest impetus for a lot of

655
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
organizations you know where they you

656
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
know outside of financial services where

657
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,640
they get like directly financially

658
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
impacted by uh

659
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
you know on a consistent basis you know

660
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
by having you know security

661
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,679
vulnerabilities but outside of the

662
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,039
financial services where there's kind of

663
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,600
a direct and immediate financial impact

664
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
the biggest

665
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,480
push that we've seen for organizations

666
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
to adopt security practices have been

667
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,159
when their customers have come to them

668
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,120
and said

669
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
we're not going to buy from you unless

670
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
you can explain

671
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,080
that you have or unless you can

672
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,000
communicate or convince us that you have

673
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
a certain level of security with the

674
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
products that you're that you're uh you

675
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
know

676
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,559
that you're selling to us right

677
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
purchasers have power uh you know and

678
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,600
certainly leading up to an initial sale

679
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
right

680
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
um and it's interesting over time you

681
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,000
know i've seen a lot of organizations

682
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
that didn't care about security all of a

683
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
sudden start to care about security

684
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,960
because they have these requirements and

685
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,320
actually one of the things that we do

686
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,760
when organizations come to us and say

687
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
like hey we need an application pen test

688
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,880
or whatever whatever the request is

689
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
one of our questions is like why are you

690
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,679
doing this right is it that you've had a

691
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,240
breach is it that you you have a new cto

692
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,520
and the mandate is we're doing new

693
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,679
security stuff um you know and a lot of

694
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
times the answer comes back like well

695
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
you know to win this contract we have to

696
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
demonstrate that we've done security

697
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,159
testing to a certain level

698
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,400
great i mean that's uh again that's a

699
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,440
great reason

700
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,679
um because it gets people to do stuff

701
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,520
and so one of the questions we then ask

702
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
is well you know in order for us to

703
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
scope this right to understand like what

704
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
level of rigor you're trying to apply

705
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,440
can you send us the contract language

706
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
that you're being bound to and that way

707
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,799
we can make sure that what we do is

708
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,880
going to fulfill that contract language

709
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
like i can identify

710
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,200
the customers right by the contract

711
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
language where people be like oh here's

712
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
the text that we have to meet i'm like

713
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
oh that's that uh no that's that one

714
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,880
airline they're like well how do you

715
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
know that like because i've seen it you

716
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
know because i've seen it from xyz other

717
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,120
folks right or uh like yo hey here it is

718
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
oh that's that retailer now why'd you

719
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,840
know that like well because i've seen

720
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,440
this contract language before it was you

721
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,799
know this is how this is how they run

722
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
their risk management program

723
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,600
and a great thing about this is

724
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,400
that you know as a global benefit

725
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,120
if every organization starts doing this

726
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
right to their suppliers

727
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
then everyone has to start doing it for

728
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
their customers right because everybody

729
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,080
buys stuff and sells stuff and when you

730
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
get a sufficient enough you know

731
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,279
percentage of the population that are

732
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,840
requiring these as table stakes for a

733
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
purchase well then all of a sudden

734
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,960
everybody is doing

735
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,039
application security work

736
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
all right you know is that you know so

737
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,320
is that right

738
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
you know is that the ideal way to get

739
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
people to undertake application security

740
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,200
programs

741
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
no right but

742
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
we live in a world where you have to

743
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,919
deal with these trade-offs and so i

744
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,880
think it's really important to

745
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,200
understand why do organizations

746
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,279
undertake these activities

747
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,760
right because in understanding that and

748
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,600
then moving beyond this good hygiene

749
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
argument for application security that

750
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,600
puts us as security professionals in a

751
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,279
situation where we can communicate more

752
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,440
effectively about the incentives and the

753
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,039
trade-offs

754
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
and where we can

755
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,840
you better implement the will right or

756
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
what is going to be most valuable in our

757
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,400
organizations

758
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,799
thing number two uh you know for a long

759
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,880
time i thought that every developer

760
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,039
should be a security expert and the way

761
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,440
to achieve this is to teach everyone

762
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,080
general security principles right

763
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,480
uh the problem is this led to

764
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,279
an over-focus on instructor-led training

765
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,440
which is comparatively expensive versus

766
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
other options

767
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
lots of discussions about theory

768
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,520
authentication authorization uh crypto

769
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
constructs and whatnot which for a lot

770
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,880
of engineers is boring it's not

771
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,799
applicable to what they're doing

772
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,039
you know not enough focus on specific

773
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
code examples

774
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
which makes it which makes the training

775
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
less immediately actionable you know or

776
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
and this was an interesting thing that i

777
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
learned uh your code examples in

778
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
languages and frameworks that the

779
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,320
development teams aren't using because

780
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,559
that's just potentially distracting and

781
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,480
confusing and so you know

782
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
again i've run a lot of instructor-led

783
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,640
training and over time

784
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,960
we made that a lot better by getting

785
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,640
feedback from

786
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
the individuals taking courses from the

787
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,720
organizations that are you know that are

788
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,799
purchasing these cork you know courses

789
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,520
uh learned a lot about how to more

790
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,440
effectively educate these developers so

791
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,600
that they can you know go out into the

792
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
world and be more effective

793
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,440
and

794
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,840
yeah it's a challenge like i came up

795
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,600
through a liberal arts education i went

796
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
to a jesuit high school went to trinity

797
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,679
university in san antonio liberal arts

798
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,840
where you know the focus is on

799
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
teaching you

800
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
like not teaching you things but

801
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
teaching you how to learn right and that

802
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,400
kind of flywheel of lifelong learning

803
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
which is a great thing i'm not saying

804
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
that's a bad thing right you know but

805
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
what we find is that

806
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,679
liberal arts education is great but

807
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,039
developer security training is

808
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
vocational training right it needs to be

809
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
much more immediately applicable so that

810
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,159
they can take away from that class you

811
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
know and and go out and be more

812
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
effective immediately in their jobs

813
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
right you know so what do developers

814
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,559
really need you know enough security

815
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,400
knowledge to do their job well

816
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,919
and this is going to vary if you're

817
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
looking at senior engineers if you're

818
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,799
looking at people that are in security

819
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,039
champions roles they are going to need

820
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,200
to have that more liberal liberal arts

821
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
approach to security education for

822
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,480
themselves like you that's what you

823
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
require at senior levels that's what you

824
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,360
require of people that are going to be

825
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,080
kind of central to driving programs but

826
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
for your rank and file developer

827
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,799
you know they don't necessarily

828
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,720
need that extensive knowledge right

829
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
unless it's a specific learning area or

830
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,640
interest area for them there's not a lot

831
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
of value in really drilling in

832
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,320
uh you know

833
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
at that level they need to know okay

834
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
what are the features i need to turn it

835
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
on and off why am i doing that great

836
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,640
what are the you know what are code

837
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,240
examples of how i need to be doing this

838
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
why is that important

839
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,120
and uh you know and and i see owasp has

840
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
created some really good resources

841
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
around these with the you know oauth

842
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,360
cheat sheets the web security uh or uh

843
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,640
you know reverses the web security

844
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
testing guide which is also a great

845
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,760
document but again targeted different

846
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
audience you know that more like

847
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,640
bite-sized

848
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,039
education that is very specific or as

849
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,840
specific as possible like that

850
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,679
moves the needle for the individual

851
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,720
engineer a lot more quickly than more

852
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,799
broad-based kind of skills or conceptual

853
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,000
training right and that was something i

854
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,840
had to learn over time again getting

855
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,679
feedback from people in classes they're

856
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,520
like why are you showing me net examples

857
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
i'm a java developer i'm like we'll just

858
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
ignore them and they're like

859
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
why do we even have the slides in there

860
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
like an excellent point right or like

861
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,600
hey why do you have

862
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
java examples on the dot-net developer

863
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,640
i'm like well you can just google how to

864
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
like what that looks like in.net now

865
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
like what do i have you for trainer

866
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,360
so that's again something that i learned

867
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,918
along the way

868
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,520
thing number three i thought this was

869
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,919
really pernicious uh you know but but

870
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,039
it's you know hey if you're not a

871
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,559
developer you ain't right

872
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,640
and i see this uh i see this i have this

873
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
fight on twitter uh once every uh four

874
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
to six months with a couple of people

875
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,399
that i that i largely respect in other

876
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,360
areas

877
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,320
um you know but but i'm a java developer

878
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
by background right and i think that

879
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,120
java developers can do anything

880
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,840
right so you should see some ui ux

881
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
designed by java developers right

882
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,919
you know that's uh

883
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:02,960
you know and you should see

884
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,279
documentation written by java developers

885
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,679
right fantastic

886
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,760
um but that was a problem that i had is

887
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,039
you know i came from this background and

888
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,799
say i'm i'm a java developer you know

889
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,360
i'm i'm upstream of all these other

890
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,880
tasks because i can write in english

891
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,080
clearly i can write documentation

892
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
because i can like you know make ui

893
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
elements show up on the page clearly now

894
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,279
i'm a ui designer right

895
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,240
and you know and that's a that's a real

896
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
problem it was a real problem for me

897
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,760
because it shaped who we hired into the

898
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,320
organization i made that narrower in a

899
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
lot of cases right and it affected the

900
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,600
you know

901
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,640
the way that we consulted with

902
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,080
organizations and whatnot so this was

903
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
something that i really had to get over

904
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
because the reality is in the security

905
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
industry

906
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
again programming skills are huge right

907
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
and learn to code is broadly good advice

908
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
no no one's going to be sad uh i don't

909
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,120
think that they learn to code except for

910
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
every professional programmer on really

911
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,080
dark days when deadlines are coming up

912
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
but like again from a professional skill

913
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
standpoint i'm not saying that being

914
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,919
able to code is not a huge

915
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,320
asset but in this app security space

916
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
like there's a there's plenty of work to

917
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,520
go around right and it doesn't all have

918
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,919
to be done by java developers right we

919
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,159
need people that specialize in a variety

920
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,159
of skill sets you know to build out

921
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,960
comprehensive security programs

922
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,279
and you know again like we need people

923
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,840
to do auditors to do grc to do ui ux we

924
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
need project managers we need product

925
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,039
managers we need documentation writers

926
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,279
there's a lot of things that go into a

927
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,840
successful security program that aren't

928
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,080
just writing uh you know java code or

929
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,360
aren't just scripting in python or

930
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
writing go or whatever the you know cool

931
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,640
kid languages

932
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
for for the day

933
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,440
and that's something again it took me a

934
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,559
long time for me to you know for me to

935
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,679
realize and that made me less effective

936
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,480
in building and tasking and running

937
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
teams

938
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,120
because of that misperception

939
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
thing number four is i i always thought

940
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,399
that certifications were stupid right

941
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,159
and uh you know and we used to have we

942
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,120
used to have to have microsoft

943
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,039
certifications for our partnership like

944
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,559
to get our free msdn licenses or

945
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,799
whatever and we would and so we'd send

946
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,559
people to take the different tests uh

947
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
and 70 was the passing score and if you

948
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,640
got like if you got over 70 we made fun

949
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
of the person that took the test because

950
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,919
they studied too hard right like it was

951
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,440
viewed as like hey we have to have this

952
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,279
so we will do the barest minimum to you

953
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,279
know to you know to get this you know to

954
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,720
get these certifications and i didn't

955
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
view that as something that was valuable

956
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,519
uh and

957
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
one of my business partners john dixon

958
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,960
uh you know

959
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,039
when the css lp certification came out

960
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,240
he said like hey dan you might want to

961
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,960
consider getting this and i was like you

962
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,080
know like that's you know i don't need

963
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
to do that you know by the way john

964
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
dixon got his cissp so long ago his cert

965
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
numbers and roman numerals right

966
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,760
i i just wish john would hear that uh

967
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,120
here here to hear me say that so i'm

968
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,720
gonna have to send him this slide when i

969
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,440
uh when i finish up right but i scoffed

970
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
at the idea right and for me that was

971
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,200
probably correct right like i was in a

972
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,240
position where i didn't need

973
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,720
certifications right i mean i had a

974
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,399
bachelor's degree in computer science

975
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,080
with a totally awesome minor in math

976
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,840
right i had a previous company exit

977
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,519
before we started denim group i was a

978
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,840
founder i had the cto title like

979
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
nobody's coming to me and saying like

980
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,039
hey you know i know you're the founder

981
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,480
of the cto but do you have your security

982
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
plus certification right like for a

983
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,279
person in my position that was not

984
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,519
the the incremental value of that was

985
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,039
not high

986
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,200
but my problem was i also thought i

987
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,480
thought because they weren't important

988
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
for me or for a person in my position

989
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
that they weren't important for

990
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,519
anyone else right and i and i certainly

991
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
would agree and vehemently argue that as

992
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,120
an industry we need to re-evaluate the

993
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,640
way that we

994
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,159
whether we do hiring and our kind of

995
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,679
hiring pipelines and things like that

996
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,600
there's a lot of work that can be done

997
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,600
there to bring more folks in who can all

998
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,279
contribute

999
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,760
but as an individual like trying to make

1000
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,679
a decision should i get a certification

1001
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,559
or not like there are folks where that

1002
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
is going to be much more valuable for

1003
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,519
their career you know folks without

1004
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,279
degrees right who need a way to

1005
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,440
demonstrate some level of expertise to

1006
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,279
get past the gatekeepers in the

1007
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,120
corporate hiring process

1008
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
certifications do have a lot to offer

1009
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,960
for those folks

1010
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,799
and so looking back my dismissive

1011
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,559
attitude was not helpful right it was

1012
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
reflective of my bias that i had because

1013
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,679
of my position you know that i flipped

1014
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,360
around and assume well everybody else is

1015
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
in the uh you know is in the same

1016
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,440
situation right or should have the same

1017
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,760
perception of values that i did you know

1018
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,840
so so why was i wrong about all this

1019
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,440
stuff

1020
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,799
i don't know if folks read the onion

1021
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,240
this is kind of an old onion article

1022
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
right but the tow truck driver has a

1023
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,159
great idea for a tow truck movie right

1024
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,840
you know the reason that i was wrong

1025
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,440
about all this stuff is because i

1026
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,679
assumed that everybody was like me i

1027
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
assume that others had a background like

1028
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,440
me and that they would think like me

1029
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
right that they valued the same things

1030
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,360
that they had the same success criteria

1031
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,240
for their projects for their career

1032
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
all right i was real focused on the

1033
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,120
trees that were right in front of me and

1034
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,919
it caused me to miss the uh you know to

1035
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,480
miss that view of the forest

1036
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,159
and and that's a problem that kind of

1037
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,800
thinking where you're only looking from

1038
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,359
your own perspective

1039
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,159
is

1040
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,079
is really damaging i know it's something

1041
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,000
that made me less effective as a

1042
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,480
communicator it made me less effective

1043
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,520
you know as a person helping

1044
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
organizations uh to address application

1045
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,839
security issues that made me a less

1046
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,000
effective team leader

1047
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,918
and you know and again it's something

1048
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,280
that i've had to look to correct

1049
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,079
um

1050
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,599
yeah so if we look back right like i

1051
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,960
think that application security is

1052
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,560
important oh and by the way i'm selling

1053
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,800
it right uh yeah so therefore every

1054
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
organization should totally think it's

1055
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
super important as well right like that

1056
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,239
type of thinking the well i'm an expert

1057
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,480
in application security everybody else

1058
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,879
probably ought to be an expert too right

1059
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,199
i'm a java developer and i'm awesome so

1060
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,960
therefore you know if you're not a

1061
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,599
developer then you're not useful

1062
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
and i'm too cool for certification so

1063
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,040
therefore nobody should value those

1064
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,480
right they're a tool that doesn't have

1065
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,839
any application like that's the type of

1066
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,359
thinking that i had

1067
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,359
that was not it was deeply unhelpful

1068
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,040
you know and i'm i'm not unique you know

1069
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
i see a lot of folks in the security

1070
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,960
space uh you know a lot of folks in the

1071
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,320
security industry are smart how many

1072
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,320
people were smart growing up

1073
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,560
right either with grades or with well

1074
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
that person's smart but like if they

1075
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,640
applied themselves they would right

1076
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,400
there's a lot of people in the in the

1077
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,240
security industry who are even worse

1078
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,280
clever

1079
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
right

1080
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,640
uh and i think a lot of folks feel like

1081
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
they need to be right

1082
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,440
right

1083
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
and uh you know and again this is you

1084
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,599
know something that

1085
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,280
plagued me for a long time and continues

1086
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,200
to plague me

1087
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,000
so

1088
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,680
you know it's it's a

1089
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,440
i think that

1090
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,240
it's important to look at like what are

1091
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,800
how do we identify situations where

1092
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
we're wrong all right you got to be able

1093
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
to put yourself and you know from other

1094
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,760
stakeholders point of views because they

1095
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,359
might not value certain parts of the

1096
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,040
outcome in the way that you do right you

1097
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,720
got to seek out viewpoints other than

1098
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,160
your own you can't be in your own just

1099
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,000
like self echo chamber or talking to

1100
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,119
folks that think exactly like you do

1101
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,560
and and you've really got to process

1102
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,839
negative feedback and that's something

1103
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,520
that's really hard to do

1104
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,720
uh i am exceptional at justification

1105
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
right and so i'll hear like feedback

1106
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,599
that reinforces what i think and i'm

1107
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,880
like that person's smart that person's

1108
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
smart that person's smart that person's

1109
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,760
smart then i'll hear something that

1110
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
doesn't agree with me right and i'll be

1111
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
like well you know that person doesn't

1112
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,079
know what they're talking about or like

1113
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,920
well that person doesn't understand this

1114
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,599
problem in the way that i do right so

1115
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,359
that's a real challenge is to take that

1116
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,599
negative feedback or or feedback that

1117
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,079
goes against what you got your kind of

1118
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,839
preconceived notion and find a way to

1119
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,480
digest that and change your opinion

1120
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,079
based on that

1121
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,280
you know it's something i do a little

1122
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,880
bit of work uh you know kind of

1123
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
mentoring startups and things like that

1124
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
and and one of the things that over and

1125
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,880
over again is like go find people that

1126
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,320
disagree with you go find people who

1127
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
think your idea is stupid right because

1128
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,520
your parents are going to tell your idea

1129
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
is great and your spouse is going to

1130
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,800
tell your idea is great and your friends

1131
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
are going to tell your idea is great

1132
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
right you need to find people that will

1133
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,839
actually tell you the truth because

1134
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,000
unless you address that truth you're

1135
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
going to put yourself in a situation

1136
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
where you're not going to be as

1137
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,079
successful

1138
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,040
right

1139
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,280
um and so you know oas has done some

1140
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
things that i think are really great in

1141
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,040
support of this you're bringing in

1142
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
different viewpoints uh you know oau's

1143
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,560
support for the women appsec i think is

1144
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,320
great again to bring folks that aren't

1145
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,839
necessarily um you know just ratio wise

1146
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,280
aren't you know found in population

1147
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,079
absolute folks the way that uh the way

1148
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,320
that others are i love what oas does

1149
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,079
where there are lower membership fees

1150
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,160
for folks uh you know for for supporters

1151
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,359
coming out of the developing world to

1152
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,200
get different perspectives there uh you

1153
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,359
know fantastic stuff and so i'll close

1154
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,920
on a uh on an amusing what i find i mean

1155
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,440
i'm using anecdote

1156
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,960
um

1157
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,440
i was at uh i was at the apsec in

1158
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,920
belfast a couple of years ago

1159
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
and i was given a given a talk uh and i

1160
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,359
don't know if for folks have been

1161
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,560
involved in oas for a while i don't know

1162
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
if anybody remembers tiffany long she

1163
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,160
was running like the oau's community

1164
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,680
outreach at the time

1165
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
uh and they were having a women in absec

1166
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
panel uh and you know at this conference

1167
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and and tiffany asked me she said like

1168
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,960
hey dan

1169
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
you know would you be in a position

1170
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,240
where you could like moderate this panel

1171
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,560
for the women in apsec um and i

1172
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,680
unfortunately had to respectfully

1173
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,359
decline i couldn't it was right after my

1174
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,119
talk and i didn't want to like have to

1175
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,119
heisman people running out of my talk to

1176
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,520
to go and moderate this panel but i had

1177
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
kind of two thoughts like number one i

1178
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,680
thought like that would be really

1179
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
valuable for me i like i wish i had the

1180
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,119
opportunity to do it

1181
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,640
um because

1182
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,920
it's an opportunity for me to ask

1183
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,720
questions and learn things um but also i

1184
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,400
told her i was like well tiffany like

1185
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,079
what message does this send right like

1186
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,960
women in appsec very important right and

1187
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,200
this women in apsec panel is a critical

1188
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,599
part to the success of this belfast

1189
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,680
apsec conference

1190
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
so to make sure that nothing goes wrong

1191
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,079
we're going to put in charge of it a cis

1192
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,320
straight white guy

1193
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,599
to make sure that this goes off without

1194
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,280
a hitch right

1195
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,880
uh and she's like okay i see your point

1196
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,040
yeah maybe we uh we need to do

1197
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,320
we'll find somebody else to manage it

1198
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
right

1199
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
um

1200
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,920
but just kind of in closing like we

1201
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,640
security is so important uh you know if

1202
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
you look at the way technology is woven

1203
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,800
into modern society everybody every

1204
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
day's lives

1205
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,720
you know we have to make it work for

1206
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
everyone and this is a marathon not a

1207
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,359
sprint

1208
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,280
the adage is if you if you want to go

1209
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,040
fast go alone if you want to go fargo

1210
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,920
together

1211
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,520
like in security we've got a long way to

1212
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,520
go um and so again just uh like i'm

1213
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,359
happy that i've been able to make some

1214
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,440
progress in my thinking and hopefully

1215
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,520
this uh puts folks in a situation to ask

1216
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,720
some questions

1217
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,170
as well so thank you

1218
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:54,099
[Applause]
