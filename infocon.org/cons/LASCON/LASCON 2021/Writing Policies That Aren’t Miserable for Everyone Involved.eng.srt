[Music]

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
well hey folks uh good to see all that

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,760
you made it through lunch you're not

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,439
sleeping yet so that's good

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,240
um

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
i'm nick leghorn as you said i work for

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,240
the new york times uh slight disclaimer

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,239
as usual uh this information is

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,360
derived from related to the new york

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
times can i guarantee the format talk to

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
your auditors basically is the tldr

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,960
there

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,840
i

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
i have a pet peeve

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,399
as well and that is policies that don't

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,079
make sense and you can't read uh

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,640
quick show of hands how many people have

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,719
actually read all of their corporate

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
information security policies

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,719
and how many of you actually wrote those

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,800
information security policies

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,239
yeah that's my thought

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,440
um so

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,799
only the people who actually wrote them

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
seem to actually read them is the

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
problem because they're incomprehensible

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,840
um

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,400
this is uh

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,520
university of california i forget where

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
um but this is their information

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
security policy and this is the format

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
it's presented it is a long

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
drawn-out legalese document that

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
describes exactly what you're intended

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
to do

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
and the only people that can seem to

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
read these are lawyers and as a result

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
no one actually follows them

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,510
right um

40
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,880
[Music]

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,799
and it's not just information security

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,640
policies it's policies in general a

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
small publication called the new york

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
times went through and looked at uh 150

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,000
privacy policies which also intended for

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,399
people to read and understand and learn

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,720
from and follow and realize that you

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
basically need a college degree to

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
understand what's in any of them like

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
these are services that are intended to

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
be used by average people that

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,640
these policies are intended to inform

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
them of what's going on and what their

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
rights are but they're incomprehensible

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,639
it takes hours to go through these

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
things and a high degree of skill to

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
understand what's actually in them so

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
there's a reason for this right there's

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,560
a reason that policies are terrible and

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
the reason is that the policies are

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,599
written

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
for the drivers of the information

63
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
security policies and the privacy

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,160
policies

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
and the drivers are

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,640
three things there's legal obligations

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,280
so lawyers have some requirements on how

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,879
these need to work and what needs to be

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,560
in things

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,080
and they're also looking at reducing

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
legal liability so how can we as a

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,400
company insulate ourselves and make sure

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
that we're not liable for stuff

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
uh there's compliance right your

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
compliance team

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,360
has hipaa ccpa gdpr soc2 pci any number

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
of the word supes

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
for compliance requirements that have to

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,599
be in these things this is where

80
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,800
the uh password rotation stuff comes in

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
because password rotation is a pci

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,040
requirement and until it's not a pci

83
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,879
requirement you can't take it out and so

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
that's one of the the problems of uh

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
just being adherent to the the standards

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,400
themselves

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
and then hr is your last driver usually

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,280
hr wants to be able to

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
if someone has gone off the deep if

90
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
someone has exported all of your user

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
database to pastebin to be able to go

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,959
and terminate said employee or have some

93
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,640
disciplinary action so they need to be

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,519
able to

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
point to chapter inverse of why this is

96
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
happening

97
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
and so those are usually your drivers

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
and so your policy

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
reflects what your drivers want

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
legal compliance hr are very

101
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
very technical very in-depth very hard

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,360
requirements that lead to a lengthy

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,959
complex policy

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,400
that requires a legal degree to

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
understand

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
but this policy this this problem isn't

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
unique to just policies um policies are

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
one area that we get on a daily basis

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
that we run into this thing where

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,319
there's a bunch of lawyers that have

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,000
dictated what a thing needs to be like

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
that we read on a daily basis

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
but that's not the only one this is

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,519
where being a pilot comes in so

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,519
14cfr 91103 uh pre-flight action

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,600
within within being a pilot there are a

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
set of regulations that you must follow

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
and if you don't follow them that's how

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
you get your license taken away 91-103

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
is specific to pre-flight action and it

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,479
says each pilot in command shell before

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,479
beginning a flight become familiar with

123
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
all available information concerning

124
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,840
that flight

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
the words all available information are

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
very very specific here

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
uh and so for airline pilots what that

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,600
means is you get a book printed out

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
before every flight that details all

130
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
available information that could

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
possibly be pertinent in any portion of

132
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,800
the flight

133
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
and what that results in is something

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
that

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
there's no way like there's there's no

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
way that i'm gonna sit there and read

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
the entirety of this thing before every

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,400
flight or before

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,039
even every day

140
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
but the problem is there's some actually

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
important stuff in there there's some

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
things that actually matter

143
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
and when you skip reading it because

144
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
those things are

145
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
lost in the sea of stuff you also need

146
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,199
to learn

147
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
you get things like this where like a

148
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,880
legion takes off and flies to an airport

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
that's closed because the closure notice

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
was a nodum that was part of the packet

151
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,840
that they got but they didn't read

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
or you get a situation where a pilot

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
crashes because he didn't get a weather

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
briefing a weather briefing is a shorter

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
version of this for for uh private

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,720
pilots

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
um that also is a giant chunk of text

158
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
and understanding all the components of

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
it are complicated and it takes time and

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
it's

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,680
dense and so finding the specific piece

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
of information you need to accomplish

163
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,880
your job

164
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,520
is difficult

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
the faa actually understands that this

166
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
is a problem though

167
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,400
um earlier this year in march uh they

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
put out this advisory circular which is

169
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,800
basically like a a note to pilots that

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
says

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,960
in essence

172
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,639
yeah these things are terrible like

173
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
pre-flight briefing is broken um the

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,880
sea of unimportant garbage is hiding all

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,960
the things you actually need to find and

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
it's making it so that it's an unsafe

177
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
situation for pilots

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,600
and they said that they're working on

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,520
fixing it and in the meantime kind of

180
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,759
gave absolution for pilots who don't

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
read the entire thing

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,360
they recommended going off and finding

183
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,600
other sources to brief themselves on i

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
use a an app called garmin pilot that

185
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,039
highlights the specific things that i

186
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,319
need to worry about for my flight and

187
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,319
does that thing for me rather than

188
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
having the giant pamphlet so other

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,240
sources that are more

190
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
focused summarized specific to the thing

191
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,199
that i need the information that i need

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,400
in my

193
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
to accomplish my task

194
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
is what they're advising me to go do

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,440
and that's i think what we should do

196
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,639
here as well with policies

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,919
so

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
before we do that let's

199
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,759
go back to basics so what is a policy

200
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
and why does a policy exist

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,960
right

202
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,840
a policy is a statement of intent by the

203
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,240
business of how they want employees to

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
operate and how things should function

205
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
uh it's trying to set a standard

206
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,160
a a baseline of expectations for people

207
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
of how you should act

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
and in doing so the op the the output

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
should be a risk reduction for the

210
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
business because if everyone's doing the

211
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,759
same thing in the same way that's been

212
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
pre-approved theoretically uh the

213
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,240
business isn't so risky you don't have

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,599
someone

215
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,199
if you have a policy against using

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
password as your default password

217
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
theoretically people won't do that

218
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,639
anymore

219
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
and you reduce risk business

220
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,639
so

221
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
in reality

222
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,120
we have been crafting policies to meet

223
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,639
stakeholder requirements we've been

224
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
crafting policies to meet the lawyers

225
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,960
requirements but really we should be

226
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
crafting employees for employ crafting

227
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
policies for employees it should be

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
designed in a way that employees are

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
able to understand and read

230
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
to get the information that they need

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,919
quick and upfront

232
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
with compliance hr and legal as

233
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
stakeholders

234
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
they're not unimportant

235
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
but they're not the core audience that

236
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
we're going for

237
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
so

238
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
let's let's deconstruct a policy real

239
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
quick look at the parts and and try to

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
build it a little bit better

241
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
uh scoping applicability so

242
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
in a standard policy these are the the

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,640
general building blocks you'll see are a

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
scope and applicability

245
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,519
who needs to care where does it apply

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
um what employees are under it that sort

247
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,959
of thing

248
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,160
usually also it's like some like

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,240
discipline reaction sort of thing

250
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
um objectives what do we hope to achieve

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,279
we're hoping to do x y and z

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,640
uh references

253
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,519
um

254
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,839
pci standards

255
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
law references

256
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
where these requirements are coming from

257
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
so you're not just saying

258
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,519
all laptops must be pink because i like

259
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,800
the color pink you actually have a

260
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
reference stating that i want pink

261
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
laptops because

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,880
uh pci 2.1 says pink is the color to be

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
a policy statement so you said what the

264
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
objective is now you say this is the

265
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,040
thing we actually want you to do a

266
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
statement of intent for management how

267
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
they should behave

268
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,399
uh standards

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,200
uh

270
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399
implementation agnostic uh usually set

271
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
of requirements around okay you told me

272
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
what you want to do how do i do that how

273
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
do i know that i've achieved that goal

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
and when i've gotten to that place

275
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
and then guidelines more implementation

276
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
implementation specific sets of

277
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,160
requirements for

278
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,839
how to meet the standards so if you

279
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
could think about it as like a

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,839
hierarchical model right the the

281
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
objective is the large part of it

282
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
um

283
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
uh policy statements are the specific

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
thing you're trying to do standards are

285
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
the

286
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,399
set of

287
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
objective statements of how you get

288
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,600
there implementation agnostic and then

289
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
guidelines are implementation specific

290
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,640
how do we get to that point

291
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
and then procedures are the last part

292
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
that takes that whole thing and boils it

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,360
down to step by step here's how you

294
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,920
achieve that

295
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,839
so

296
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
typically how this all works right is uh

297
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
the top bunch are are slammed into one

298
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,959
giant document that no one ever reads

299
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,279
again um and then you've got a bunch of

300
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
procedures that are generated by the

301
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
business or

302
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,320
uh engineering teams or who has it um

303
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
that describe what they do on a daily

304
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
basis and aren't really tied to anything

305
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
right there's no um

306
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
there's no way to reference them

307
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
properly or

308
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,440
uh when an audit comes up there's no way

309
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
for them to be brought into the process

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,440
in a a meaningful way

311
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
because they're really just disjointed

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,120
there's no consistency

313
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
but what if we take all those things

314
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,079
and we decouple them so instead of it

315
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,600
being one

316
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
giant uh

317
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
monolithic policy

318
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,839
we take

319
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,920
those create new things by the audience

320
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
because really

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
when you boil it down the first three

322
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
are really what hr legal compliance

323
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,560
those folks care about they care that

324
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
you have scope and applicability you

325
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,600
have objectives you have references

326
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
that's where they're able to go back to

327
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,079
their auditors and say this is why we

328
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,440
are doing these things this is where we

329
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,079
got it and make them happy

330
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
policy statements and standards are are

331
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,440
more for upper management for

332
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,959
especially when you're doing kicks off

333
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
kickoffs for purdue projects why are we

334
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
doing this thing what do we care about

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
what is the intent for this it's it's

336
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
more about uh task prioritization

337
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
um and just setting up expectations for

338
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
why this is a thing

339
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
guidelines are where you start getting

340
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
into okay you've told me to go

341
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
build a cloud solution that does xyz

342
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
what does that actually mean guidelines

343
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
are where that

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
more general guidance

345
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
comes and is more implementation

346
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,320
specific

347
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
so where a policy might say build a

348
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
compliant aws

349
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,519
or build a compliant cloud instance the

350
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,839
guidelines would be aws specific gcp

351
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,920
specific azure specific for how you do

352
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
those sort of things

353
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
and then procedures are for

354
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,079
specific tasks within that umbrella

355
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
for the individual employee to go

356
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
reference

357
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
now not only do they understand exactly

358
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
what it is to do x y and z they can tie

359
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,519
that back to the guideline where it came

360
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
from they know that ties to the standard

361
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,839
where that guideline was derived they

362
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,240
can understand how that flows from the

363
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
top from the scope and applicability and

364
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
objectives all the way through the

365
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
policy to their specific point and they

366
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,519
don't really care about the rest of the

367
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
stuff right if i'm

368
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,680
some l1 employee that just got hired the

369
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
other day spin up a cloud server i have

370
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
the procedure

371
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,040
i have the specific part of the policy

372
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
that matters

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
i don't need to read the rest of the

374
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,600
policy because i know that it all flows

375
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
together and it has some backing to it i

376
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
have the portion that is important to me

377
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
so

378
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,519
uh the way to break it down then is the

379
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,120
first three go into what i call a policy

380
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
overview uh so it's a one single page uh

381
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
document

382
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
one single document probably multiple

383
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
pages um where it talks about these

384
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
things and puts all the stuff together

385
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
this is like the if you think about this

386
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,639
like a book right this is the

387
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,120
introduction uh this is the opening of

388
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
the book where it talks about what is

389
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,160
going on and why the things matter

390
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,800
uh statements and standards are where

391
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
you go into details so these are the

392
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
chapters of the book this is the the

393
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,680
meat and potatoes of what you're doing

394
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
and why you're doing it

395
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,160
you don't need to do a new uh scope and

396
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,760
applicability objectives and references

397
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
for each of these things because it's a

398
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,440
reference right you have one document

399
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
that sits at the top

400
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,519
each policy details document references

401
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
those documents

402
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,199
and so you only have the portions that

403
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,120
you need

404
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
guidelines become guidance docs

405
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
and procedures become procedures

406
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
and the way you make this hierarchical

407
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
like i said one policy overview for the

408
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,360
whole thing so one understanding of

409
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
where these requirements are coming from

410
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,000
uh what the overall requirements are uh

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
that ties to different policy details

412
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,240
documents of okay there's a network

413
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
security policy coming off of this

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,680
security policy there's a cloud security

415
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,279
policy here

416
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,279
each of those has multiple guidance

417
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,120
stocks referenced under it

418
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
each of those guidance docs have

419
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,240
multiple procedures referenced under it

420
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,399
so it's a hierarchical process that

421
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
flows from the top and makes sure that

422
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,279
you

423
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,360
uh isolate the portions of the policy

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,240
you actually care about

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,079
so what does this look like in practice

426
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,519
so um

427
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,199
this is what a policy overview would

428
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,160
look like

429
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
uh and the the best way i've seen to

430
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,360
uh to actually implement this is if you

431
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
put this

432
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
um

433
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
i want to make a note here right um

434
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
the best way to display this stuff is on

435
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
a web page of some sort right we're all

436
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
remote these days we're all in tech

437
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,399
companies probably we're we're dealing

438
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,920
with people who have used a website

439
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,199
before

440
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
displaying the stuff on a website makes

441
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
the most sense having a linked

442
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
note from page to page allows you to

443
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
have that tie from each page to the next

444
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,880
one it allows you to link back up

445
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
so at the top there if it says

446
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,399
information security policies overview

447
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,759
that could be a single document you

448
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
write once and you don't have to worry

449
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
about updating it for every single one

450
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,360
or duplicating it or having a portion

451
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
that people skip around on if you really

452
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
want to read it go for it it's up there

453
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
but the thing that uh you really care

454
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
about is is what's on the page there

455
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
uh and so creating something like this

456
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,519
where there's a an overview page

457
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,680
that links to all the policies and has a

458
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
a quick hit a single sentence that

459
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
clearly describes what each policy is

460
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
doing and why it exists

461
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,800
uh is is critical right because that's

462
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
that gives us the ability to hand this

463
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
page to a new employee they're able to

464
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
scan it really quickly understand the

465
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,839
gist of okay there's these policies that

466
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,360
say these things

467
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,440
and if i need more information i now

468
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,120
know exactly where i need to go i don't

469
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,079
have to read the whole thing to

470
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,759
understand what it's asking

471
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
i know that there's more information in

472
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
there if my job requires me to do these

473
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
things

474
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,199
but if i as a network engineer uh don't

475
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,959
need to touch uh

476
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,480
servers at any point in time i don't

477
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,759
need to understand the system pardon me

478
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
guideline it's not something i need to

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
read so you don't have to force me to

480
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,560
read the entire information security

481
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
policy to get there

482
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
um so it's easy to read easy to see

483
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,519
understandable

484
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,320
um

485
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
and like i said i'm making a note here

486
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,160
that the the easiest way to read it as

487
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
an employee is in a website format but

488
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,639
that doesn't necessarily mean that the

489
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,359
auditors like that format right

490
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,720
so if you uh if you create policies like

491
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,839
this having a printed version of it

492
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
is really the the best way to do it you

493
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
can just roll it into a single pdf you

494
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
just have all these pages zipped up into

495
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,439
one big uh binder

496
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,359
and that usually satisfies requirements

497
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,640
they don't really care

498
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,760
um

499
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
they don't care how big it is they just

500
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
care that the content is there

501
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,720
and so if you have a lot of these extra

502
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
navigation stuff in there it's it

503
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
doesn't really matter to them

504
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,720
uh policy details page so right once you

505
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
once you get to the point where you say

506
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
okay we have a network security policy

507
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
we are going to do these things we shall

508
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,760
ensure that all data and systems on our

509
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
network are properly secure right that's

510
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
the intent that's the policy that we're

511
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
saying how do you know that you've

512
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
gotten there

513
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
policy uh a policy and standards are

514
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,720
supposed to be implementation agnostic

515
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
so if you take a look the

516
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,799
the bullet points here all connections

517
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,720
must be encrypted doesn't say ssl

518
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,039
doesn't say vpn doesn't say

519
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,799
uh have to have an f5 load balancer in

520
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,080
there with an apm

521
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,160
that's the standard is you have

522
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
encryption of some sort

523
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
and then underneath that you can link to

524
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,600
okay what does that actually mean for

525
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
the thing i'm trying to do so if i have

526
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,520
a sas application how do i secure that

527
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,760
with appropriate encryption uh or if i'm

528
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
filing up a gcp uh

529
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,840
system how do i turn that on and make

530
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,960
sure that it's enforced all the time

531
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,360
so this is direct actionable

532
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
implementation agnostic things if i'm

533
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
going out and setting up a new system i

534
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,360
know what my expectations are if as an

535
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,080
application security engineer i now or

536
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
sorry as a developer i now understand

537
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,679
what the apps like people are going to

538
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
be looking for i know what the

539
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
requirements are that checklist looks

540
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
like uh for for setting up my new system

541
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,039
before i even uh flipped a single switch

542
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,799
this is great for

543
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,559
quickly providing requirements to teams

544
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,320
and a great quick reference sheet for

545
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,520
just making sure you've hit all the

546
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,760
things

547
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
and then guiding stocks are really where

548
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,720
we get into meat and potatoes of

549
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
what do you expect so when you're

550
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,799
setting up

551
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,559
so this one is like a secure application

552
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,440
development guideline right so for this

553
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
sort of a document

554
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,760
um

555
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
what i would expect to be in here would

556
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,960
be like okay here's a template of what

557
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,720
it looks like to set up a go application

558
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
in a secure way here's what a good

559
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,559
terraform document looks like for

560
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
setting up your environment

561
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
what does the paved road look like and

562
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,360
how do i follow that paved road

563
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
so we're gone we've gone from

564
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,240
implementation agnostic where it just

565
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,679
needs to be encrypted needs to be

566
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
secured you need to do these things to

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
specifically this is how you do that

568
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,240
this is what the paved road looks like

569
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,960
uh so if you are just an engineer who

570
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,880
needs this information this is all you

571
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
need to do to go to this is the only

572
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,760
document that you need to reference you

573
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,039
don't need to look at the rest of the

574
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,360
security policy to understand what's in

575
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
it

576
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
so

577
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
benefits

578
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,200
so uh

579
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,039
what we just talked through right is a

580
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,320
way of breaking up and deconstructing

581
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
much like the uh uh highly paid chefs

582
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
downtown and austin do

583
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
when they deconstruct like a cheesecake

584
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
or something um we've deconstructed what

585
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,039
a policy is we've taken the parts and

586
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
the components we've figured out a

587
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
little bit better what

588
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
components are for what audiences and

589
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
we've thought about

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,400
what do we put in each document and

591
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
where does it go and how does it work

592
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
so there's a couple benefits to this um

593
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,840
the big one

594
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,720
as a former person who ran a grc team is

595
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,480
that it's decoupled

596
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
so now every time i go and update one

597
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
component of the security policy i don't

598
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,240
need to go and revalidate to the

599
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
security policy if i want to change that

600
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,080
uh i'm no longer requiring password

601
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,559
rotation every 90 days i only have to

602
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,240
update the password rotation part of the

603
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
policy and that's the only document that

604
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,600
changes i don't need to touch the

605
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
overview i don't need to touch anything

606
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
else i just have specific stakeholders

607
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,120
for that little document and that's all

608
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,880
that changes which makes my life a lot

609
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,960
easier

610
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,919
common components are reused and

611
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,600
referenced on each page so you can move

612
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
up and down the chain if you want to

613
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
look at

614
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,679
if you really care about what the

615
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,360
references are you can go and look at it

616
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,039
but as 90

617
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,760
of the employees will never do that you

618
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,200
don't have to burden them with that kind

619
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
of information

620
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,760
and the documents can be compiled for

621
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,039
auditors

622
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,679
especially putting it in a

623
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,600
a format like this

624
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,679
actually somehow or somewhat makes a

625
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,880
little bit better like it's going to

626
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
make the policy document look bigger

627
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
because it's going to be a bigger book

628
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,679
of stuff

629
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,520
but because you have clearly defined

630
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
where the requirements are for each

631
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
specific section auditors will now know

632
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,120
where to go to look for those things so

633
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
it makes it a lot easier for them to

634
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,159
come in and just check the box that yep

635
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
i've got that section in there that's

636
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
all good to go

637
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,760
uh in terms of use building

638
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
comprehension only the necessary

639
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,120
information at the appropriate level of

640
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,840
resolution is there so if i walk into a

641
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,080
meeting with a bunch of c-level

642
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,400
executives i can whip out that high

643
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,919
level here are just the basic

644
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,760
requirements of what we need i don't

645
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
need to give them the guidance document

646
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,200
the procedure document that stuff they

647
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
don't care about right i'm slicing it to

648
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,840
just the stuff that they need to

649
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,919
see links to further documentation

650
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,600
and can be used as a checklist so now

651
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,360
that we have the requirements clearly

652
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,520
defined we know what the expectations

653
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
are you can use it as your checklist to

654
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,879
figure out how do you do these things

655
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,679
so

656
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,280
this isn't the end right

657
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
just slicing out your stuff into

658
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,679
different documents is isn't the end-all

659
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
be-all of creating good policies and

660
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
good stuff right

661
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,039
the format doesn't really matter if your

662
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,880
content is terrible

663
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,720
so

664
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,080
ways to write better policies i've found

665
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
keeping policy standards short

666
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,799
readable and implementation agnostic is

667
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,600
is critical if you write a policy that

668
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,760
states you must use a gcp function that

669
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
google then deprecates then your policy

670
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
is basically useless and people have to

671
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,840
violate your policy to actually do

672
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,360
things

673
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
so if you keep all of your policies at a

674
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
high level where it's implementation

675
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,480
agnostic you don't care whether you're

676
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,400
using gcp aws whatever some uh openstack

677
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
cloud that you created internally

678
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,840
doesn't matter as long as you're meeting

679
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,280
the requirements that's really what

680
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
matters and that's really what good

681
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
security is is meeting the requirements

682
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,679
and expectations

683
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,200
uh

684
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,039
once you've got that stuff written down

685
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,159
and figured out

686
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,200
making sure you have appropriate

687
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,520
management buy-in for policies uh not

688
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
just going ahead and like slamming in an

689
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
information security policy because your

690
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
auditors say you have to do it but

691
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
actually talking to the right people

692
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
talk to the engineering teams to make

693
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
sure that they're on board with these

694
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,919
changes and these are actually

695
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,320
supportable

696
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,279
and then a good poor a good thing to do

697
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
is to actually make sure you're tying

698
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,240
each of your policy requirements to

699
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
specific controls

700
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,159
so even if

701
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,679
even if you're just using pci

702
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,600
cis 20 oauth top 10 like those

703
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,240
handful of high level things you can

704
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,919
pretty well tie a lot of your

705
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,360
information security policies directly

706
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
back to those

707
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
it's

708
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,720
a lot of help when you're fighting with

709
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
engineering teams or users who say i

710
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
don't want to do a thing

711
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
to be able to tie directly back to this

712
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
is why we're saying it we're not saying

713
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,080
it because we're the bad guys we're not

714
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,760
saying this is a policy requirement

715
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,919
because we feel like it's a good idea

716
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,039
we're saying this is a policy

717
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,679
requirement because xyz standard says

718
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,279
this is how it happens this is what

719
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,520
happens for that

720
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,400
so it's uh

721
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
yeah

722
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,880
so thanks to to work for that regulatory

723
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,360
frameworks work well hipaa gpr ccpa pci

724
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
whatever

725
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,960
industry standards are great backups

726
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,559
if there's something that doesn't fit

727
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
those other things having uh even just a

728
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,120
list of risks that you're reducing and

729
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,720
being able to tie those policy

730
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,000
requirements to the risk that you're

731
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
talking about will let you

732
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
have that discussion a little bit better

733
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,720
we don't know we don't allow vpn uh

734
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,080
we don't allow people to connect to the

735
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,400
data center without a vpn because this

736
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
is a risk we've identified on our

737
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
register and we're not doing it it's a

738
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,120
lot better conversation then we're not

739
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,000
going to let you do it because we don't

740
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,240
want to

741
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,760
making your guidelines useful is also

742
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,790
really important

743
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,919
[Music]

744
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,200
making sure your documentation actually

745
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
matches your environment a lot of

746
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
policies are written once and put on the

747
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,240
shelf

748
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,679
so making sure you go back and update

749
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,799
your policies and your guidance

750
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,159
documents to make sure that they

751
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,080
actually meet what you're doing uh if

752
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,600
you've just shifted from an on-prem

753
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,760
deployment to a cloud deployment going

754
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,440
in and updating those things is super

755
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
important

756
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
um

757
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,679
providing useful information for

758
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,559
engineers uh is is one of the big ones

759
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,760
um so it's

760
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
one of the nice things

761
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
uh about creating good documentation and

762
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
good policies in this way is that you're

763
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,480
able to tell engineers that information

764
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,840
is in the policy you should read the

765
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,159
policy this is a thing that you should

766
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
go do because it trains them that

767
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,840
everything is in the policy

768
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,600
so if the policy is useful and they'll

769
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,679
actually go read the policy they'll more

770
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,520
likely go back to the policy rather than

771
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,840
bugging you in the first case and will

772
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
consistently follow the policy because

773
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,039
it's written out there

774
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
so making it useful means that they

775
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,919
actually get something out of it they're

776
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,200
actually going to read it rather than

777
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,919
just ignoring it

778
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
making sure you have paved roads so if

779
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
you don't have a template for how to

780
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,640
stand up a gcp environment or if you

781
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
don't have

782
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
a code example for how to set up a go

783
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,039
environment or what a

784
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,440
standard application would look like

785
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
providing a paved road

786
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
allows you to to point to those things

787
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
that already exist

788
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
so you're able to give the developers a

789
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,159
starting space

790
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,840
that already is compliant so rather than

791
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
having to guess at will this or will

792
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,200
this be okay

793
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
having them start from that framework

794
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
allows them to

795
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
be able to riff on it and start to

796
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,799
develop and actually build useful things

797
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,000
rather than having to go back to the

798
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
security requirements every single time

799
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,960
and figure out if it's okay or not

800
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
and then reaching out uh uh adding a way

801
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,760
to reach out for for questions um i like

802
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,480
including an faq section on on my policy

803
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,399
documents um that gets constantly

804
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,559
updated with just things that are are uh

805
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,960
coming up all the time um

806
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,360
and it's a good way to not only

807
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,200
um make sure the questions that are

808
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
getting asked a lot are getting answered

809
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,640
in a consistent way but it's a way to

810
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,760
keep yourself honest if you've said

811
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,240
x y and z is banned or we want to do

812
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,320
this this way instead having a

813
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,919
documented place where you've answered

814
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,520
that question before allows you to make

815
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,960
sure you're consistent in how you apply

816
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,640
it so you're not just

817
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
spouting out stuff when you think when

818
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
you think it's a good idea off the cuff

819
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
you actually have a consistent answer to

820
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,919
things

821
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,039
this is really it this is the key like

822
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,399
uh that it's

823
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
i'm not gonna lie it's a super short

824
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,960
presentation uh because it's it's a uh

825
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,520
uh i think it's a

826
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,880
it's a pretty simple concept

827
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
that you should be providing the right

828
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,159
information at the right level of detail

829
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
with the appropriate audience and that's

830
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,679
what policies have been missing

831
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,679
uh for the last

832
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,480
ever right we write them

833
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
for lawyers because lawyers ask us for

834
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
them and uh auditors ask us for them but

835
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,120
we don't write them for security and or

836
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,559
for engineers we don't write them for

837
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,880
employees and as a result when an

838
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
employee actually has to use it

839
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
it is a it's a cluster it just doesn't

840
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
work

841
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,240
so

842
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,720
this is my format that i use uh for

843
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,159
writing policies to make sure that

844
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,760
they're

845
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,000
in bite-size chunks

846
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,840
i found it works pretty well

847
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
and i think as long as you follow the

848
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
principle of just

849
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,120
making sure that you're writing to the

850
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,640
audience that you're expecting and not

851
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,559
your auditors it's just a better

852
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,440
solution um so the nice thing is

853
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
if you're

854
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
chunking all these things into

855
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
individual documents right

856
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,919
you're able to change and rev one

857
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,360
specific portion of the document you

858
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
don't have to rev the entire thing

859
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,559
uh so you can actually put all your

860
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,320
policies into git

861
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,080
and and have it all sourced there

862
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
especially there's a way to uh there's

863
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,039
some templates where you can like

864
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,440
automatically create pages in gcp on

865
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,679
websites based on git repo that pushes

866
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,960
there um super easy to do uh so even if

867
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,559
you just do it that way where you just

868
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
rev things and get you just have a web

869
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,240
page that has all the information in it

870
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,399
uh super easy to maintain

871
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
the more complicated thing that you

872
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,159
might be asking about is like how do you

873
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
ensure that the approval is there for

874
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
the right

875
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,399
document at the right place

876
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,640
having uh

877
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,559
for each document having a set of

878
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,039
stakeholders even if it's just teams

879
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,200
that is important for that document it

880
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,039
doesn't have to be every stakeholder for

881
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,600
every document right hr might want to

882
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
be a stakeholder for everything legal

883
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
probably wants their fingers and all the

884
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,279
pies

885
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,399
but the engineering team probably

886
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,559
doesn't really care about like

887
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,399
desktop hardening requirements

888
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,200
um making sure you you keep uh at least

889
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,720
at a team level

890
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
responsible for signing off on these

891
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
specific

892
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
these specific changes

893
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
helps you cut down the number of people

894
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,320
that actually have to do anything on it

895
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,559
and enable you actually to

896
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,559
to publish things quicker

897
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,480
one nice way of

898
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
of handling those sort of things is is

899
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,320
making a distinction between

900
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,279
um

901
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,039
policy like for uh a formal policy so

902
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,399
policy overview policy details standards

903
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,240
and guidance documents

904
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,640
having those set up and described as

905
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,320
like these are the official documents

906
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,679
right these are the things that we

907
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,520
actually publish and we send out to our

908
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,519
auditors typically you won't really give

909
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,399
like uh procedure documents or uh or sub

910
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,760
documents to an auditor unless they

911
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,360
really ask for it at that point there's

912
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
an understanding that this isn't really

913
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,080
part of the policy like this is an

914
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,240
implementation of the policy you've put

915
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
out

916
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
so giving the faq document that level of

917
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
understanding that this is this is an

918
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,120
interpretation of the policy this is a

919
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,960
document off of it but this is not the

920
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,559
legal policy

921
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
helps them differentiate those things

922
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,320
like you still roll it up you can still

923
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,960
see how it derives from the rest of it

924
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,840
but it doesn't give it that same

925
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,600
it gives them some wiggle room like if

926
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,360
i've said something in the faq that's

927
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
wrong i have the ability to go back and

928
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
edit that because it's not officially

929
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
part of the policy

930
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,039
one of my previous bosses

931
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,760
who doug is going to laugh at

932
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
once told me he wants the policy to be

933
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,559
no longer than one sentence

934
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,120
and i uh struggled with that for a while

935
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,240
until he realized that he was actually

936
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,399
right like the policy statement itself

937
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,000
is supposed to be one sentence that you

938
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
can understand what is implied by the

939
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
rest of it

940
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
and so when i do attestations

941
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,480
or like when i

942
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
my suggestion for doing attestations to

943
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,480
the grc team that we have

944
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,559
is

945
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,559
to attest to this

946
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,240
this is the page that says these are all

947
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,679
the policies that exist these are all

948
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:16,880
the things that are out there this is a

949
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,320
high level understanding of what there

950
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
is

951
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,200
i don't expect that an engineer would

952
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,919
sit there and read all 130 pages of

953
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,120
whatever uc santa santa clara's

954
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,360
policy is i would expect you to go and

955
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,880
read that like that's i think it's a

956
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,320
reasonable understanding that you know

957
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,840
this is a one page thing you understand

958
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,120
what's in there

959
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
and that's a more useful

960
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,039
um piece of information that i

961
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,880
understand where the location is to get

962
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,360
this if i need it rather than having

963
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,159
them read the literal thing

964
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,279
all right folks

965
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,919
i appreciate it

966
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,918
you
