00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,439
application security so i've been on

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
both sides of making and breaking

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
applications

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,759
a little bit of a little bit about my

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
inspiration for this talk um

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
so in my previous employers

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
you know during that decades worth of

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,199
time that i talked about i

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,720
i worked at

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
large corporations

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
berkshire hathaway insurance company a

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
worldwide data provider cable services

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,200
conglomerate

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,640
these places had

64
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,480
between three and five thousand

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,520
employees

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,640
and

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,319
uh now

68
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
i work at a smaller

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
company with a startup culture there was

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,920
about 150 employees when i was hired and

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,840
there's

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,680
uh 350 now

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
we're we're growing but we pale in

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,400
comparison to the numbers

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
of my previous employers and and when i

76
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
joined

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,640
contrast

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,440
uh it

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
there was just a lot of things i saw

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,239
that um i thought wow this is something

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
that we can do better and it was such a

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
struggle at these large bigger

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
corporations and so i wrote out this

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
outline for this talk and i started

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,720
filling it in and i realized that i had

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
a lot of good

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
um a lot of good things that i learned

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
from working at these big organizations

89
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
these large enterprises on their

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
internal application security teams that

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
i could bring and you know hopefully

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
help people solve

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,319
so

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,879
you might be wondering why

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,360

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
mountains

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,519

ned ned's directives

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
from his management right he has to

133
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
ensure all code bases are secure

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
including all open source software

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
that's utilized

136
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,120
ensure future development is secure so

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
they want to shift left with future

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,919
development his his e staff heard the

139
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,520
term shift left

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
you know

141
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
five years after it was first brought up

142
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
and now they think we need to do it

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
he also is tasked with training software

144
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
developers and secure coding practices

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
and minimizing attack factors in

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
external facing applications those are

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,240
his initiatives from you know his

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
e-level staff that that ned gets day one

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,639
start a team

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,560
meet these objectives

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
so uh

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
there's challenges right away right out

153
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
of the box

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
um

155
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,039
two out of three applications fail to

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,120
pass initial tests on the oau's top 10

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,479
and sans 25 standards

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
171 days is the average time to

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,160
remediate an application vulnerability

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
and bsim recommends that one

161
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
software security specialist to every 73

162
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
well bsim actually excuse me vsim

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
actually says that there's one software

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,360
security specialist to every 73 software

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
developers and engineers

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,720
that's like i want to

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
talk about that last stat there because

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
that's insane right

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
if you think about it

170
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,319
if i step behind a developer and i

171
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
watched them all day

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
and just to make sure they were coding

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
securely i could do it if i sit behind

174
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
two or three developers i might be able

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
to do that can you imagine

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,199
you as an abstech person watching 73

177
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,479
developers

178
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,080
and trying to figure out all of their

179
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
code and making sure it was secure all

180
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,319
day long every day

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,560
that's impossible right

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
uh not to mention ned's team also has to

183
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
review new library vulnerabilities

184
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
new oss phones they're being released

185
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,400
every day you know uh developers are

186
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
just bringing in new code

187
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,560
and it's it's a it's a

188
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,039
really challenging task

189
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,240
also

190
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,759
um

191
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,520
all the most common vulnerabilities for

192
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,319
the last five years are still prevalent

193
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,360
today

194
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
uh

195
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
there's 65 percent of apps still have

196
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
sensitive data exposures 36 percent of

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
applications still have security mis

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
configurations these are all things

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
that jeff talked about uh over at the

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
keynote being around for you know since

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
he started the top ten

202
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,599
and this is the kind of thing that ned

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,840
has to face as a challenge

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
right your typical application

205
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
these numbers are changed slightly today

206
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
is about 20 custom code right but here

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,919
are a couple numbers that i think is

208
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
really interesting

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,560
so

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
of the

211
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
of that uh custom code

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,039
70

213
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,919
of it is unused which is crazy to me

214
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
some of that's framework specific but

215
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,759
the majority of oss code is unused

216
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,280
and 93

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
of all vulnerabilities are found inside

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,039
of custom code

219
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,240
so

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,319
these are these are challenges right

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,919
that but ned

222
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,039
i mean ned being a good apsec steward he

223
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,039
was aware of these challenges right he

224
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,680
was ready for it and prepared he had

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
some climbing gear

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
to summit these mountains he had he's

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
using sas his company already purchased

228
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,720
sas they had das uh tooling they had a

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
waff they had compliance so he's

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
thinking

231
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
you know what

232
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
i'm prepared for anything right

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
ned feels like i i i'm ready for

234
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,039
whatever comes

235
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
right chipotle whatever

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,039
so

237
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
uh but this is hand-me-down climbing

238
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,320
gear right this is something that

239
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
existed at his company already before

240
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
they said ned go create an application

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
security team

242
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,799
so

243
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,880
um

244
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
let's talk let's pivot from ned and

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,800
let's talk a little more about the state

246
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
of application security

247
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
there are hidden challenges right

248
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,920
old tooling m a new products and new

249
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
technologies workplace shifts inflexible

250
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
developers those those are all

251
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
challenges that face

252
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
uh large enterprises and i'm going to

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
talk a little more about each of these

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
old tools

255
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
well

256
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
here's kind of a timeline uh

257
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
i'm i'm younger than my boss so i i just

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
put dinosaurs over here

259
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
but here's some of these uh

260
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,040
here's some of these uh tools that have

261
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,600
been developed along the way right uh

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,920
you've got 1999's kind of when pen

263
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
testing became common the wash top 10

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
came out in 2001

265
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
you have

266
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
dynamic scanning static analysis

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
compliance

268
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
i've uh

269
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
by the way i shamelessly stole this

270
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,080
timeline from another team member slides

271
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
but uh it's i think it does a really

272
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
good job of talking about kind of

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
the way that security is

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
uh changed or or new things and new

275
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
features that have come out in security

276
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
um so

277
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
talking about ned right most large

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,720
enterprises already had these four

279
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,640
things in yellow they've purchased them

280
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
they've already existed i mean in ned's

281
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,920
case these existed as hand-me-down tools

282
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
before

283
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
ned came aboard

284
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,480
so

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,839
if you look

286
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,440
dynamic scanning

287
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,160
sas tools compliance wafts they've been

288
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,519
around for

289
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
almost 20 years right this that's about

290
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
the time they became popularized so

291
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
they're

292
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,600
they're

293
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
they're a little older security tooling

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
what's wrong with that well it could be

295
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,519
slower

296
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,800
scanning

297
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
and remediation can also be slower

298
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,880
you can miss vulnerabilities um i knew

299
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
one of my sas products at one of these

300
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
large enterprises uh it was it took

301
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
uh

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
days to update so we'd get an update

303
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,560
and we'd create a ticket

304
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,640
we'd fight over who had to do it

305
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
and uh then the loser would have to go

306
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
and uh figure out okay well i need to go

307
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
update this so i need to actually get

308
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,160
this machine id of the server i don't

309
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
own and then i need to send it over to

310
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,560
to them so that they can put it inside

311
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
of their binary and then send it back to

312
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
me and then i can do an update and so

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,959
that would take days sometimes to get

314
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,040
all that completed well in that time

315
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,720
frame right you could be missing

316
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
vulnerabilities they just had an update

317
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,560
maybe they just put in brand new cves

318
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
and detection

319
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
and so while you're waiting on that you

320
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
could end up missing

321
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
vulnerabilities

322
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
and some of these tools

323
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,600
alert fatigue that's a big one who in

324
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
here has experienced alert fatigue

325
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
that's in yeah that's the majority of

326
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
hands that's insane

327
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
alert fatigue in these old tools you're

328
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
going to get notifications on every

329
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,360
little thing that you're going to have

330
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
to figure it out

331
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
what's that mean to ned right ned has to

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
spend hours

333
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,480
looking over alerts to figure out which

334
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,560
ones are valid which ones aren't that's

335
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
that's time he could be spending

336
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,800
improving the company's security posture

337
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,680
but instead he's working on

338
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,079
like reading alerts and figuring out is

339
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
this a valid finding

340
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
is this a false negative false positive

341
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,160
excuse me false positive

342
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
uh and

343
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,279
often they don't often offer the best

344
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
protection against attacks

345
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,079
but

346
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
that's a little foreshadowing i'll talk

347
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,240
a little more about this later

348
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,600
so let's

349
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
let's also let's talk a little bit about

350
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
mergers and acquisitions

351
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,920
um

352
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
if you've never worked at a large

353
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
company this is referred to as m a this

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
happens all the time at large companies

355
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
right my they go out and they

356
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,880
they just they buy companies and their

357
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
strategic reasons for buying companies i

358
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
worked at a company one time that bought

359
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
another company because they had

360
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,519
printers that they wanted

361
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
i'm dead serious

362
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
dead serious so

363
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
this is something that

364
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,639
really happens

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,279
and when m a happens

366
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,240
uh

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,000
that really affects your internal

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
application security team i remember

369
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,360
this company that they bought because

370
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,959
they wanted their printers they came to

371
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
us and they said we need you to do m a

372
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
on this company's application security

373
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,720
posture and we said hey uh let's put a

374
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
stop gap on this because i broke their

375
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
whole thing with a single tick mark

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,279
and their whole application is shut down

377
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,680
and re restart everything from scratch

378
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,880
because they aren't doing any input

379
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
validation

380
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,880
and why do we want to take on this risk

381
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,639
and my company said

382
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,839
we really need those printers

383
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
so

384
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,639
they bought them

385
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
and you know we inherited these like

386
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
terrible applications that we

387
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,519
immediately

388
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
had to secure

389
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,959
and uh

390
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,480
you know it's that's the kind of thing

391
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,519
that ned

392
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,120
here has to deal with too working at

393
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,959
this large enterprise now if you look at

394
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,000
this mountain

395
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
it's getting bigger right it's got old

396
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,639
tooling

397
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,079
mergers and acquisitions are causing

398
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,040
problems

399
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
i mean every business

400
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
this is a famous quote

401
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,639
and i think it's attributed to

402
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,600
satya from microsoft but every business

403
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
will be a software business

404
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,079
um

405
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,560
and that's true right i mean this

406
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
company bought a company because they

407
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,760
wanted their printers

408
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
and uh

409
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
and they had software that ran these

410
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,360
printers and

411
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
chose out their customers i mean they

412
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
had customer data on this application i

413
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,440
could break with a single tick mark

414
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
and now we now we owned it

415
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,199
so

416
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
this is like i said this is a natural

417
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
thing especially if your company is

418
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
publicly traded

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,680
you don't know what you're inheriting it

420
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,279
could be terrible software garbage

421
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
servers etc

422
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
it's a huge problem for internal

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
application security teams

424
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
uh not to mention the application spread

425
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,839
okay i'm gonna uh put both both of these

426
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,199
up it's a little easier to talk about

427
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,480
here so industry-wide that uh let me

428
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,839
describe these pie charts because

429
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,600
they're a little confusing so

430
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,440
industry-wide about 54 of the industry

431
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,399
has

432
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,519
between 1 and 200

433
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,120
applications

434
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
all right and

435
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,959
industry wide

436
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,440
23 have between 200 and 500 applications

437
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,279
but if you talk about

438
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,760
large organizations 5 000 plus employees

439
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
right the majority of that have over 1

440
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
000 applications

441
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,199
that they

442
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,880
actively manage

443
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
and that's i mean

444
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,120
that's everything right you have your

445
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
internal software that

446
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,759
i don't know tells you what days off you

447
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,480
get

448
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,199
or

449
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,279
you know managers or vacation days you

450
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,800
have your software that uh

451
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,399
that tells

452
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,199
your

453
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,560
that tells your employees which

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
envelopes to fold and send out yeah i

455
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,880
mean that's everything a thousand

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
applications

457
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,880
that's insane

458
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
and you also have to worry about

459
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,079
new products and new technologies

460
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,839
another concern right when you think

461
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,360
about software it's ever changing

462
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
do all of it can can anybody name all of

463
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
the uh logos on here

464
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,440
yeah

465
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,759
there's a lot right

466
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
but uh you've got

467
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,600
you know your micro services kubernetes

468
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,560
docker

469
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,839
you've got your automation your

470
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,360
continuous integration here you've got

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,279
your cloud environments

472
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
you've got your agile your devops

473
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,959
everything's changing and you saw that

474
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
timeline earlier there's new things

475
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,279
coming up all the time

476
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
and what's that mean for

477
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,120
what's it mean for ned right well his

478
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
mountain's getting bigger again

479
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,000
uh

480
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,519
when he thinks about like what's the new

481
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,759
hotness is it rust does it go

482
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
does he now have to plan around new

483
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
languages are his developers

484
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,160
really eager to try a new

485
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,680
uh technology or language that will

486
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,399
you know affect ned i mean ned's here

487
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
and he's like i'm a java expert i'm a

488
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
php expert and i'm a net expert oh

489
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you guys become a go expert and a rust

490
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
expert and a

491
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
node expert like all at the same time

492
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,959
too

493
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,880
that makes it really difficult

494
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
um and chances are his existing tools

495
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,480
aren't going to necessarily cover all

496
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,000
these new languages and new hotness

497
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,119
right because

498
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,360
people like me vendor we've got to

499
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,559
figure out and

500
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
and write code you know write our

501
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
products to

502
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,520
account

503
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,039
for these new languages and new

504
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
technologies

505
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,760
so

506
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
now it's starting to get nervous that's

507
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
that mountain's looking a little bigger

508
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
now and he's thinking

509
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
this this is kind of a difficult job now

510
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
um

511
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,600
i don't wanna

512
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
i wanna i wanna be clear here though

513
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,080
like we don't wanna

514
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
discourage

515
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,280
innovation from

516
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
developers

517
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
but we want to encourage

518
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,240
consideration

519
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
right

520
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,960
uh workplace shifts when you're talking

521
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,760
about large corporations happens all the

522
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
time

523
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,919
it's hard to you know it's hard to

524
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,679
swallow a fact but

525
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
there are still workplace shifts that

526
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,240
happen

527
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
especially now during this covid

528
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,280
pandemic too

529
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
older developers retire and move on to

530
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,000
new roles

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,520
layoffs uh um sometimes layoffs are

532
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
accompanied by like overseas hiring

533
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
right and workplace shifts so

534
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,080
you don't always have the same staff

535
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,799
you know that that are in your building

536
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,280
ready to help you um

537
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
all the time

538
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
ned's got to spend some of his time

539
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,080
training

540
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
and that

541
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,640
that makes him you know even more i mean

542
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
look at this guy he's getting nervous

543
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,840
now right

544
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,679
he's got to train to employees i mean

545
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,840
sometimes remote locations different

546
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
time zones

547
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,320
uh

548
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,919
language barriers

549
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,919
and then retaining knowledge of the

550
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
departed staff like that's crucial how

551
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
how do you make sure

552
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
that you continue to meet your

553
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,360
application security standards

554
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
um

555
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
and then the last little hurdle

556
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
inflexible developers

557
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,520
uh

558
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,880
this

559
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,640
uh

560
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
sometimes security is seen as a blocker

561
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,919
this is unfortunate right sometimes

562
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,480
sometimes

563
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,919
yeah uh this is unfortunate right i mean

564
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,160
as an application security team

565
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
it's my goal to be a service oriented

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
group right we want to

567
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,760
service the uh

568
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,160
uh the the

569
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,240
enterprise we want to provide services

570
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
to the enterprise where they come to us

571
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
and

572
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,200
in order to do that we need to

573
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,679
get around these inflexible developers i

574
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,720
mean

575
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
when you have problems with development

576
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
teams

577
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,720
that security and tech debt grow

578
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
right

579
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
engineering fights

580
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,559
to

581
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,120
backlog security

582
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
sometimes

583
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
security teams report up through

584
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,120
engineering how backwards is that right

585
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
when you report up through engineering

586
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
that they can just

587
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,120
sideline whatever you're doing

588
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,919
and findings can get swept under the rug

589
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,159
i mean band-aids you get put into code

590
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,760
and forgotten about

591
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
i mean this this happens i don't need to

592
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,679
tell you all you all know this happens

593
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,840
and that's that's a problem

594
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,039
and ned

595
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,320
knows it

596
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,640
that is a huge amount now he looks super

597
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
nervous and he's worried about taking on

598
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,720
this task of starting this internal

599
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
application security team at this large

600
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
enterprise it seems impossible right

601
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
this mountain looks big but not only is

602
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,039
it a big mountain he's got to push all

603
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,960
these boulders and juggle all these

604
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,679
things and get to get up the mountain

605
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
but let's talk about solutions okay

606
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
cause ned he's still at base camp all

607
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
right this is one of my favorite mitch

608
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,320
hedberg jokes so i'm gonna pause for

609
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,400
people to read it but he's still at base

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
camp uh so he's

611
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,799
you know he's just hanging out

612
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
all right now i need to climb the

613
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,760
mountain

614
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,320
um and base camp's fun

615
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
so

616
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,159
but but but ned he you know ned wants to

617
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
climb up that mountain

618
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,120
and uh he is so starting out he's got a

619
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,520
lot of energy to tackle the big things

620
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
just a repeat i'm not gonna do this all

621
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
the time but just repeat you know he

622
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,120
needs to ensure all current code bases

623
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,159
are secure

624
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,240
ensure all future development is secure

625
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
trained software developers and secure

626
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,000
coding practices and minimize attack

627
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
vectors and external facing applications

628
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
this was handed down to him by his

629
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
e-suite right at the beginning

630
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
so let's talk about that shift left uh i

631
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,400
i

632
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,919
put this slide in but most everyone

633
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,919
knows what this means at this point uh

634
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,520
shifting left means

635
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,480
where your security scanning sits here

636
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
and shifting left means they want to

637
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
bring in security earlier on in the

638
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,840
process

639
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
um

640
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,080
so you have a waff right here

641
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
um this is usually left on a monitor

642
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
mode uh because of all that alert

643
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,159
fatigue that we talked about earlier

644
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,559
so

645
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,200
let's uh that slide might have been out

646
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,559
of order let's uh review these

647
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,880
challenges real quick um

648
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,120
i i just did old two-lane mergers and

649
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,320
acquisitions new product new

650
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
technologies workplace shifts inflexible

651
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
developers so security tooling

652
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,679
can new security tooling really help

653
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,720
with speeds

654
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,039
the answer is yes right

655
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,000
here's two options i asked and rasp if

656
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,280
you haven't heard of these acronyms

657
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,360
that's interactive application security

658
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
testing and runtime application

659
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,158
self-protection

660
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
if you went to jeff's talk yesterday

661
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,360
about

662
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,120
jot

663
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,919
his

664
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,640
java observability toolkit

665
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
instrumenting code bases can really help

666
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
with speeds and

667
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
detecting vulnerabilities

668
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,159
agents instrument the code bases to

669
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,240
provide security against attacks and

670
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,559
allow for more expedient remediation by

671
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
pinpointing issues

672
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
this is kind of how they work

673
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
uh detected iest will detect

674
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,440
vulnerabilities with instrumentation to

675
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,120
observe applications as they run during

676
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,720
testing so is an agent that sits on your

677
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,840
um on your big monolithic app let's say

678
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
and

679
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
anything that you exercise a route that

680
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
you exercise will

681
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,840
it will track from source to sync and

682
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
determine if there are any you know any

683
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
ways that it's trying to escape a sync

684
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
boundary or anything vulnerable in

685
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,520
between

686
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
these are really popular amongst like

687
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,279
financial institutions and health

688
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
institutions because they don't really

689
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,880
care if it takes you

690
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
you a few extra seconds to get your

691
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
health information you're not going to

692
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,279
go anywhere else

693
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,799
you can't get it anywhere else kind of

694
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,080
thing so

695
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
these are really popular um this is

696
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
usually run like on

697
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,200
on a developer's machine essentially uh

698
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
and

699
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,159
and developers can use it to determine

700
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,760
vulnerabilities before they ever push

701
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,000
this code um and

702
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
testing suites help with this right

703
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,440
because you're exercising all these

704
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
different routes so the better qa you

705
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,679
have the better your eye ass is the more

706
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,279
routes you can test

707
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,960
um the more the you know the more um

708
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
vulnerabilities you can detect and the

709
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,320
more um

710
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
remedia and the more things you can fix

711
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,120
it's it's it's providing continuous and

712
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
real-time assessment throughout the sdlc

713
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,799
and devs get immediate feedback with

714
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,200
that uh there's also rasp solutions

715
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,520
which that they sit in production

716
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
uh and they detect and block

717
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,480
exploitation

718
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
like live okay and there's a there's a

719
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,919
difference between

720
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
a waff and a rasp tool set

721
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,360
um because it can actually differentiate

722
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
differentiate between attack attempts

723
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,559
and attacks that have actual impact

724
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,679
because

725
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,320
let me give you an example here

726
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,919
here is

727
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,880
okay there's a ctf running

728
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,279
by one of the sponsors uh today you

729
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,600
could name your team anything you want

730
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
sometimes people use

731
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,720
clever team names like or one equals one

732
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
you know the little bobby tables uh

733
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
thing

734
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
and somebody might name their team

735
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,000
script alert one okay now on the back

736
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,919
end this might be some of the code that

737
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,440
you see

738
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
this goes and it takes the takes

739
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,440
whatever team name you put in the input

740
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,720
and it it grabs it saves it to the state

741
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,840
and then

742
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
it uh

743
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,600
it prints it out to the screen okay

744
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,960
well

745
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
this code right here is susceptible to a

746
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,120
cross-site scripting attack right

747
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
um because if i put in the second input

748
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,240
and i put it out on the screen it would

749
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
there it would pop an alert right now

750
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,480
i've got no sanitization i've got no

751
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,679
safe html or anything like that i'm just

752
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,679
taking whatever the input is

753
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,520
sticking it on the screen

754
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,559
but

755
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
that first one

756
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,159
that that won't really affect anything

757
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,200
right

758
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,279
i could print that on the screen easily

759
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,400
i but it's a very blatant sql injection

760
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
attempt if i had a database

761
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
you know but in this tooling with a waf

762
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,840
it would block both of those and say no

763
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,600
can't name your team that no i can't

764
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
can't do that

765
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,159
but with uh rasp solution it's able to

766
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,679
differentiate by tracing from the input

767
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,799
to the sync

768
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
the sync being right here where we're

769
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,799
printing it back onto the screen and it

770
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,679
says

771
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,440
that one's allowed number two isn't

772
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
and that's the a rasp solution has that

773
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,799
advantage over a waff solution

774
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,640
yeah it protects application runtime

775
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
environment from unwanted changes and

776
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
tamperings

777
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,640
and again it can give you trace uh

778
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
attempts from source to sync

779
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,039
now

780
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,480
does it actually help you remediate

781
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,720
faster the answer is yes

782
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,799
this comes from contrast and varicode

783
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,840
but

784
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,799
the percent of

785
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,320
sas remediations

786
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,360
versus the percent of rasp remediations

787
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
within one month

788
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,600
60 percent

789
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,080
of of uh vulnerabilities are closed if

790
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
they were detected by rats

791
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,559
only 30 by sas

792
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
but um

793
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,159
the percentage of vulnerabilities

794
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,279
remaining

795
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,039
right that are still there after three

796
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,679
months you know in the backlog or

797
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,960
uh that become

798
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
huge security issues eventually uh 55

799
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,679
was sassed and only 32 with rasp

800
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,039
so again

801
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
we're still not remediating fast enough

802
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,080
but this definitely will help

803
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
shifting left

804
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
let's talk a little bit about shifting

805
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
smart this used to say shifting out but

806
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,520
i went to jeff's talk yesterday and he

807
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
was wearing a shirt that said shift

808
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
smart and so i took a creep shot photo

809
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,960
of him and i put him in my slide deck

810
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
and i changed it from

811
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,760
shifting out to shifting smart

812
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
so

813
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,480
but yeah let's talk a little bit about

814
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
that right if you

815
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,279
um

816
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,640
shift smart

817
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,799
uh let's talk about that laugh and that

818
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,039
rasp over here okay remember that waff

819
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,440
was in monitor mode um what i'm

820
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,679
recommending is let's put that sucker in

821
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,600
block mode and

822
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,159
let's really uh let's really narrow the

823
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,640
scope right we're only blocking super

824
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
egregious stuff that we definitely know

825
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,919
is an attack

826
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,159
and we're also instrumenting with rasp

827
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,720
right there at that level and then we're

828
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,840
gonna shift left over here too with an

829
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
is and we're gonna involve that in the

830
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,279
in the testing and that's gonna be we're

831
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,080
gonna uh we're gonna have uh a testing

832
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,320
suite exercise all of our routes

833
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,039
so

834
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,679
shifting out is we're shifting smart in

835
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,120
this case um definitely helps provide

836
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
newer tooling that

837
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
provides better remediation

838
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,600
and shorter

839
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,000
shorter remediation cycles and

840
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
better findings

841
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,399
so let's check on ned

842
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,399
uh that's kind of solving this old

843
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,360
tooling

844
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,840
he identifies the need for new tools he

845
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,480
says look we can accomplish this whole

846
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
shift left approach and

847
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,840
get new tools at the same time and

848
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,760
provide better results and remediations

849
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,600
so he's made progress but there's still

850
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,919
a long way to go

851
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,039
let's talk about mergers and

852
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,559
acquisitions

853
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,799
ned convinces his executive staff level

854
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,520
to get appsec more involved in m a

855
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
discovery okay this is a

856
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
this is a big deal um

857
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,200
because

858
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,559
it's hard to do

859
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,600
but

860
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
money talks okay after that printer

861
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,360
fiasco we calculated how many hours we

862
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
spent fixing the apps

863
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,640
and we said we spent so much time

864
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,159
fixing these apps

865
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,960
that

866
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,360
you could have used that

867
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,120
to lower the price of this company you

868
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,159
just bought

869
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,080
we're buying your software so we

870
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,919
need to lower the price

871
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,279
of your company

872
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,320
um

873
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,159
it can only be a positive to involve the

874
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,559
application security team so this is a

875
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,480
hard conversation to have

876
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
but um if you can start providing

877
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
numbers and metrics

878
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
uh that'll help convince an e-level

879
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,559
staff member

880
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,080
so

881
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,039
uh

882
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,559
i'm gonna check that box ned ned did it

883
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,039
uh it's hard to do but ned did it in

884
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,240
this

885
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
scenario so let's talk a little bit

886
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,640
about

887
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
new products and new technologies again

888
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
ned does not want to discourage

889
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,399
innovation

890
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,080
he wants to encourage consideration

891
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,039
so

892
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,960
one of the things that ned could do is

893
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,679
create an acceptable use policy

894
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,960
um basically a list of things

895
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
that

896
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,279
um

897
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,320
that we that people can download and use

898
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,399
uh it's it's not going to go well if you

899
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,000
tell developers you're taking away their

900
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,880
admin privileges but you can

901
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
put this on compliance now and say hey

902
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,960
this is something that we're going to do

903
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,760
where

904
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,320
these applications are approved through

905
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,360
security and and others um and the

906
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,039
mission statement right

907
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,720
of the erb

908
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,440
well so adding to the policy is easy

909
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,279
but it does need to be reviewed by an

910
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,880
enterprise architecture review board or

911
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
er board

912
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,720
and their mission is to provide a

913
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,320
strategic approach

914
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,279
to innovate technology-based solutions

915
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,600
and maintaining an optimal consistent

916
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,159
set of standardized best practices

917
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,679
so their goal right is to allow you to

918
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,159
innovate but just make sure that the

919
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,360
stuff that you're bringing in meets

920
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,840
their best practices and so this is a

921
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
good way that you can get

922
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,039
security architecture you can get

923
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,640
the development architecture groups you

924
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,919
can get uh

925
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,320
engineering managers and then security

926
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,760
all in a room

927
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,919
and say hey is this a new technology

928
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,519
that we're comfortable with and if one

929
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,960
person says no

930
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,799
then you don't do it

931
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,919
um

932
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
and then compliance enforces this right

933
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,120
you have to do an asset management and

934
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,720
determine if people are installing stuff

935
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,519
that's outside the acceptable use policy

936
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,159
let them know hey this isn't allowed

937
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,399
um but the reality is

938
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,760
uh take

939
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,000
throughout he is uh taking away admin

940
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
privileges and locking down workstations

941
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,559
uh makes for a bad work environment for

942
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,480
developers so if you can

943
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,799
do this and say you all agreed to this

944
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,799
when you got hired here

945
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,720
um now this is enforceable what

946
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,840
compliance

947
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,720
uh it still allows them to innovate but

948
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
also uh requires consideration

949
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,679
so ned now is he's checking off some of

950
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,120
these he's getting a little higher on

951
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,840
the mountain this is mad over

952
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
here he's working his way up the

953
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,080
mountain

954
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
let's talk a little bit about

955
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
workplace shifts okay

956
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,039
uh

957
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,919
continuing my my movie posters

958
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,720
um this happens it's not always fun

959
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
and not without much notice

960
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,440
there's a couple things that ned can do

961
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,600
if he does if he doesn't have advanced

962
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
warning

963
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
he can be prepared ahead of time

964
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
a couple things that

965
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,440
we do we have burn lists

966
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
which is basically a list of all things

967
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,279
that users need to do

968
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,080
that users need to get wiped

969
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
any account

970
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,159
that's that has user credentials

971
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,840
it could be vast and take significant

972
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,440
time to make this list

973
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,120
but the sooner that net can automate it

974
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
the better right if you have a single

975
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
sso

976
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,399
it's way easier than if you have a bunch

977
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,120
of places worth credentials

978
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,039
uh and then the other thing this is this

979
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,159
is something that people don't think

980
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,440
about that often

981
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
default cred sweep

982
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,960
how many of you have staging or test

983
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,359
environments and then have test

984
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,079
credentials on those uh that people that

985
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,159
all of your developers know and use

986
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,560
right and unless it's locked down where

987
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
they can't physically they can't access

988
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,440
that

989
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,679
they still remember those you know i

990
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,119
still remember i worked in an auto

991
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,560
insurance company

992
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
and the default password there was web

993
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,159
raider for you

994
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
and i still remember it to this day you

995
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,719
know and yeah there was like an eight

996
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,520
instead of a b and the four was

997
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,760
uh it was just a four and the u was

998
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,159
capitalized but i remember it

999
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,839
like to this day and i work i only i

1000
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,280
worked there three years

1001
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,679
and i could still pull up their default

1002
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,399
the default accounts and so as an appsec

1003
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,159
person you need to be periodically

1004
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
testing this

1005
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,918
are there known test credentials can i

1006
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,720
can you do something can i provide sso

1007
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
to my test and staging environment so

1008
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
that you don't have to worry about test

1009
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
accounts or service accounts

1010
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
uh can you make a service account that

1011
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,359
has credits that rotate automatically or

1012
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,480
stored in like a a key base uh type of

1013
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
thing

1014
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,480
i mean that's that's the that's the kind

1015
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,880
of stuff that you have to do there

1016
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,760
and

1017
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,400
what about the new the new people right

1018
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,200
um so ned has to train all the new

1019
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,079
people

1020
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,680
so one of the things you could do here

1021
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,800
is use a training platform that's remote

1022
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
and easy to distribute anybody can do it

1023
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
from home doesn't have to be an

1024
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,960
in-office type of thing

1025
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
it's important that any new employee

1026
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,800
goes through secure software development

1027
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,359
training before they ever touch code

1028
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,480
so i put a moratorium on development

1029
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,400
until you do your training

1030
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,240
and it also creates documentation around

1031
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,320
standards best coding practices one of

1032
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
the things that you could do here is you

1033
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
could stub out authentication

1034
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,599
best practices uh session management

1035
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,920
basic api requests

1036
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,240
you know database connections and more

1037
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
right and he says these are our best

1038
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,000
practices these are best practices for

1039
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
php these are best practices for java

1040
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,640
these are our best practices for net and

1041
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,359
then when the developers has to build a

1042
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,960
new app or gets confused about something

1043
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,680
they can just go to the best practices

1044
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,800
and say hey

1045
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,880
i need to create authentication

1046
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,040
net already stubbed this out for me copy

1047
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,119
paste move it over i know it's secured

1048
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,800
ready to go

1049
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
and i know that it's best practice we're

1050
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,079
using the right

1051
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
you know uh

1052
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,400
authorization

1053
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
all right so ned he's working his way to

1054
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
the top he's nearly there

1055
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,480
this is one of the the biggest

1056
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,119
challenges in flexible development right

1057
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,359
he's ned's high enough to appreciate the

1058
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,599
view but he's not comfortable yet

1059
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,160
uh i i pulled this photo up i was gonna

1060
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,480
go visit this this is in hawaii i was

1061
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
gonna go there um before my wife got

1062
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,400
co-fed

1063
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,599
uh and uh we were heading to hawaii and

1064
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,280
and i pulled this up this is a hiking

1065
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
trail that she wanted to go on and i

1066
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,960
sent her this picture i said are you

1067
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,280
sure look there's mountains on either

1068
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
side of this trail right here

1069
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,640
cliffs

1070
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,040
look it looks dangerous to me but anyway

1071
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
so how do you handle those inflexible

1072
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,920
developers

1073
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
application fighting

1074
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,599
engineering is a fight where everybody

1075
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,640
loses

1076
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,680
the if you recall the ferris bueller uh

1077
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
war games movie uh matthew broderick i

1078
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,640
should say not ferris bueller uh the

1079
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,040
their old quote the only way to win is

1080
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,880
to not play the game

1081
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,599
all right so when you're

1082
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,960
combating with these inflexible

1083
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
developers don't engage right

1084
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,119
there's several things that can improve

1085
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,599
improve the relationship first i

1086
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,520
mentioned earlier application security

1087
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,000
should be housed outside of engineering

1088
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,320
it should be under a ciso cio cfo

1089
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
ideally reporting to the board would be

1090
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
my

1091
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,960
you know my my uh if i had my druthers

1092
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
it creates a separation of priorities

1093
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,720
among engineering management

1094
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,040
and it's important that

1095
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,280
to reiterate like application security

1096
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,760
is a resource not a hindrance after all

1097
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
developers don't want to push vulnerable

1098
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,040
code

1099
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
i mean it's bad for business right it's

1100
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,119
bad for their careers bad for job

1101
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,720
security everything if they're pushing

1102
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
vulnerable code

1103
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,359
and application security engineers uh

1104
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,280
i'm one of those people i do believe

1105
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,440
that having development experience is a

1106
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
positive is a plus because as an apsec

1107
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,240
engineer

1108
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,200
uh if i can um commiserate with um and

1109
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,359
with the actual developer at my company

1110
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,400
it it makes that bond a lot easier to to

1111
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,440
develop

1112
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,880
and

1113
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
make sure that you make friends with the

1114
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,359
developers

1115
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,640
they're going to be who you spend most

1116
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,000
your time with

1117
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,320
maybe visit their office do joint

1118
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,280
outings you know eat lunch with them

1119
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
i

1120
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,720
i work in nebraska but most of the

1121
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,119
engineers at contrast are in baltimore

1122
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,560
and so one of the first things i did was

1123
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,200
i took two weeks trip to baltimore and i

1124
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,280
stayed there and every day i lunch with

1125
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,400
all the developers and i'd go out

1126
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,920
to their restaurants and stuff like that

1127
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,000
and i'd hang out with them uh there's

1128
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,440
like a chess board and a video game

1129
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,280
system i'd play games with them too

1130
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,240
because

1131
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,320
like th these are the these are my peers

1132
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
they're the people i'm going to be

1133
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,240
relying on and working with on a daily

1134
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
basis

1135
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,480
and

1136
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,200
one of the things that ned does right is

1137
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,880
ned decides he's going to buy all the

1138
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
developers pizza

1139
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
and who attend his monthly security

1140
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,960
briefings he's going to host open door

1141
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,119
monthly security briefings anyone who

1142
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,200
comes gets free food

1143
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,119
so stuff like that can endear yourself

1144
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,160
to developers other things you could do

1145
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,119
training

1146
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,200
training doesn't have to be boring you

1147
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,079
don't have to send them a two-hour

1148
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,760
powerpoint deck right

1149
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,839
gamify your competitions

1150
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,640
uh capture the flag contests are a ton

1151
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,480
of fun and

1152
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,440
they help

1153
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,520
that they help them bond together

1154
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,960
because they form their own teams and

1155
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,119
they compete against other developers

1156
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,839
they help the devs

1157
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,680
bond with you because they have to come

1158
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,599
and ask you questions but it also

1159
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
establishes your expertise here is a

1160
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,839
tough security challenge

1161
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,200
and i wrote it for you and

1162
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,960
if you don't solve it

1163
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,560
uh you can come to me and ask questions

1164
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
and i can help you get there but it

1165
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,240
demonstrates your expertise now now you

1166
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,680
are the expert right and you could do

1167
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,240
secure coding hackathons we did one at

1168
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,319
contrast last week

1169
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,680
we had uh 62 people sign up

1170
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,200
36 people

1171
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
like

1172
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,440
got prizes technically and then you know

1173
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,079
we had 10 we had top 10 finishers and it

1174
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,760
was open to all of our

1175
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,440
developers and

1176
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,200
contractors and everything

1177
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,720
and

1178
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
and i i've heard nothing but good

1179
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
feedback about it lunch and learn

1180
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
sessions

1181
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,280
q a

1182
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,760
pizza et cetera joint outings i mean

1183
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
these are all things that can endear

1184
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,359
yourself to developers because you guys

1185
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,760
should be partners right you shouldn't

1186
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,839
be competing you should be cooperating

1187
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,640
uh

1188
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,000
when i got a speeding ticket when i was

1189
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,319
like 20 i went to one of those stop

1190
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,720
classes where they they they say like if

1191
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,319
you go to the class we'll race the

1192
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,400
ticket and in there the guy said

1193
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,599
something that changed my driving

1194
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,680
forever he said hey

1195
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,280
this isn't a competition you're not

1196
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,640
racing other people on the road you're

1197
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,560
cooperating with them to everyone get

1198
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,160
where you're going

1199
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,520
and

1200
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,359
working with your working with

1201
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,119
developers is like that right you guys

1202
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,560
are all cooperating to get where you're

1203
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,400
going

1204
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,520
so ned

1205
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,359
has summoned the mountain he's gotten to

1206
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,800
the top

1207
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
he's accomplished all of his directives

1208
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,119
feels pretty good to be ned

1209
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,920
so

1210
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,319
uh thank you all for coming uh if

1211
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,400
anybody has any questions or q a i'd

1212
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,079
love to

1213
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,480
take that now

1214
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
i found

1215
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,680
more often than not

1216
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
more than less less often than

1217
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,520
inflexible developers

1218
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,280
it has been inflexible abstract people

1219
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,880
less often you sin

1220
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
inflexible outside people i've seen much

1221
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,680
more often than inflexible developers

1222
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
and i'll give an example of a company a

1223
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
bigger company with a big asset program

1224
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,400
and developers will say oh this isn't an

1225
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,560
issue right like we found this thing and

1226
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
they would walk through it they'd have

1227
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,880
to like

1228
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,800
painfully explain it to the opposite

1229
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,760
team

1230
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,720
and then the opposite team at the end

1231
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,119
was like you're right it's not an issue

1232
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,720
but you should fix it anyway so the tool

1233
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,319
doesn't alert all them

1234
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,880
oh yeah that's that's a problem too that

1235
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,920
that undermines every bit of credibility

1236
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,240
for the entire security program with the

1237
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,160
developers yeah

1238
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,000
when you can walk through that or when

1239
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,720
when you're you know focusing on well

1240
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,839
you have this checklist of things from a

1241
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,000
static analyzer a dynamic analyzer or a

1242
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,880
pdf report that you're you want them to

1243
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,319
fix but they're like well this actually

1244
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,160
doesn't make sense it's not

1245
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,319
viable in the context of how this

1246
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,040
application runs or right the user that

1247
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
this is even useful so yeah

1248
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,680
and that can see more often that the

1249
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
developers are right in that context and

1250
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,800
the abstract people are just kind of

1251
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,400
sticking to the dogma

1252
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,040
absolutely do i mean the developers know

1253
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,599
their code better than you do

1254
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,640
there

1255
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,760
there's a that reminds me of

1256
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,720
any

1257
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,920
they know write node applications uh

1258
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,839
there's a

1259
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,760
npm audit script that you can run on

1260
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,839
your node applications which will go and

1261
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,760
check your package.json for vulnerable

1262
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,280
packages

1263
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,160
we had we had somebody come up to

1264
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,280
uh

1265
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,440
they were new and they ran that on a

1266
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,079
node product and they said oh my gosh

1267
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
look at all these vulnerabilities and we

1268
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,160
went over and we said well you know we

1269
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,720
worked with them but uh it turns out

1270
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,160
that the vulnerabilities uh existed like

1271
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,400
only on developer dependencies and they

1272
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,480
were never actually put into the actual

1273
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,920
product that we you know served uh and

1274
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,000
and having that good understanding of

1275
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,760
what's happening i mean it doesn't

1276
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,599
matter who it comes from but like that's

1277
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,520
the most important thing then

1278
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,720
uh

1279
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
and then you have to address it too so

1280
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,319
you definitely have to be flexible as an

1281
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,400
application security team the developers

1282
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
know their their code and their land a

1283
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
lot better than you do that's why i do

1284
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,400
think it's important that application

1285
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,480
security engineers have some sort of

1286
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,640
understanding of code because when they

1287
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,800
go and they break that down for you like

1288
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,359
you need to understand why that doesn't

1289
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,720
work and why it's a false positive and

1290
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,560
why you need to

1291
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,880
figure out how to correct the tool

1292
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,280
and not them change something in their

1293
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,000
code because this doesn't apply so

1294
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
that's a great point

1295
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,839
i'll touch on that a little bit more

1296
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,680
expand that because i developed that

1297
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,440
same situation recently with a

1298
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
node-based application

1299
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,599
the development team is not an issue not

1300
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,599
an issue not an issue

1301
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,200
but then we step back and look when you

1302
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,040
think about things like solar winds and

1303
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,359
that whole context of your supply chain

1304
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:14,720
being vulnerable

1305
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
the lack of awareness of the development

1306
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
they were laser focused i gave them

1307
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
expertise on the app they were building

1308
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,319
they did not understand that 70 percent

1309
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,839
because of that that they were driving

1310
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,440
with them yeah what else they were

1311
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,680
driving into their environment and i was

1312
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,280
like oh look that's great

1313
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,960
but look i see this port now open on

1314
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,720
your jenkins server

1315
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,800
and it's popping up every six hours when

1316
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,280
you do a build and wow i got root access

1317
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,880
i'm changing folks

1318
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,839
yeah that's how i did all the

1319
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,000
credentials

1320
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,040
yeah

1321
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,359
i i give both sides to it but

1322
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,280
really knowing the who behind it don't

1323
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,119
just accept the developer

1324
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,560
you know on both sides of it don't just

1325
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,920
accept the engineer knows or the

1326
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,319
securities

1327
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,240
i think that that that bond that i talk

1328
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
about you know where you kind of endear

1329
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,599
yourselves to each other i think that

1330
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,960
helps that right

1331
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,200
you you know you have to understand if

1332
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,680
they're the expert about xyz but they

1333
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,800
have to understand that you're the

1334
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,400
you're an expert at

1335
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,880
abc you know and and you guys have to

1336
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,800
come to some sort of understanding and

1337
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,040
and when you're able to show them hey i

1338
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,720
got rude on your box and dumped all your

1339
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,119
creds because you're using this uh

1340
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,640
that's a good way to

1341
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,800
to demonstrate it to them that hey that

1342
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,160
that is a bad thing supply chain is a

1343
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,240
supply chain is a is a beast i actually

1344
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
am talking next week in california about

1345
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,040
supply chain at the linux uh the linux

1346
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,359
foundation member summit uh so it's

1347
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,839
there's a there's a whole mess to go

1348
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,760
with supply chain issues but then the

1349
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,440
scariest thing a lot of the supply chain

1350
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,760
at the moment are on the editor on

1351
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,520
public networks

1352
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,920
that's true

1353
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,839
i did want to hit that's why i pointed

1354
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,359
the 70

1355
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,400
there

1356
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,040
um the next step is that also referring

1357
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,800
to what's in your supply chain setting

1358
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,720
so not used or does that bring into that

1359
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,920
the actual application your outlook

1360
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,839
the application that you're putting in

1361
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:08,960
production

1362
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,839
um 70 percent of anything in there

1363
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:12,720
that's

1364
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:13,599
um

1365
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,480
that was uh custom code is or not custom

1366
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,520
code is not even

1367
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,280
used right

1368
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
oh yeah that's totally possible i mean

1369
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,640
that those numbers could be just based

1370
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,000
on supply chain when you're talking

1371
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,760
about a node application i mean even

1372
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
maven installs and shits on the

1373
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,599
dependencies nowadays

1374
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,520
see yeah it doesn't get it doesn't get

1375
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,079
curse words

1376
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,720
what somebody over here was saying

1377
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,040
something

1378
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
sorry i got wrapped up

1379
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,040
oh okay all right yeah

1380
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,079
yeah but uh yeah that it drives it

1381
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,400
drives a lot of that number certainly

1382
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,920
but i mean

1383
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,079
that's the code that you're putting in

1384
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,760
per you know you're putting in your

1385
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,000
finished product 70 of it's not even

1386
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,599
used so you have to think about those

1387
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
kind of things what's making really

1388
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,359
tough is is trying for the opposite side

1389
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,040
for us to try to figure out

1390
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,119
you know spending the teams don't have a

1391
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,960
lot of time maybe

1392
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,880
i don't know if my situation isn't you

1393
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,400
can't feel like it because you can't

1394
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,040
talk to vendors

1395
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,240
trying to figure out am i in a supply

1396
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,480
chain or some other co-drive issue

1397
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,559
or developer i didn't know the team is

1398
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,920
well enough to figure that out i don't

1399
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,000
have a lot of time

1400
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,520
and a lot of these things like i didn't

1401
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,359
have to know oh this version of angular

1402
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,280
now carries this and all that's there's

1403
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,040
another build process that cuts out but

1404
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,880
none of the tools check them like they

1405
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,040
don't

1406
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,280
we're actually finding our customers are

1407
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,160
scanning the software we make the entire

1408
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,240
deliverable yeah and you know if you

1409
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,319
want to talk about

1410
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,160
ways to have really bad sales

1411
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,760
experiences

1412
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
have the sales team spend the entire

1413
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,680
engagement talking about the vulnerable

1414
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,160
open source software that you bundle as

1415
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,319
part of the thing you deliver to them

1416
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,079
it's a nightmare do you really want that

1417
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,599
to be the focus of the discussion or do

1418
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:24,880
you want it to be about the features and

1419
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
quality of your products right yeah and

1420
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,559
the companies doing that are not the

1421
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,880
it's not jim bob delhi that's doing that

1422
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,040
it's it's the equivalent of ford and

1423
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,839
marriott and boeing and you know these

1424
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,440
these little customers you might have

1425
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,000
there are they're actually doing this

1426
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
and don't have that be a surprise for

1427
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
your sales teams it just doesn't work

1428
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,160
well

1429
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,680
yeah i've been through that by the way

1430
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
that's not fun

1431
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,880
that's only going to grow with the

1432
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,640
s-bomb thing so

1433
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,880
everybody's going to have that

1434
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,640
i thought we decided that

1435
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
uh s bombs weren't necessary last night

1436
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,160
in the speed debate

1437
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,480
well but it's like the other guy said

1438
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,960
it's the recursive spot it's not just

1439
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,319
what you included

1440
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,920
it's what that drags along and that's

1441
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,119
where we see

1442
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,280
most of the vulnerabilities right and

1443
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,520
then the challenge becomes using spring

1444
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,680
is a simple example

1445
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,319
and some like i said some tools

1446
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,480
check that well yeah but the trick right

1447
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,160
is you look at spring and spring looks

1448
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,680
great you go out to the national

1449
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,960
vulnerability database and there's

1450
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
nothing in it and what's happening is

1451
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,280
just grabbing a two-year-old version of

1452
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,880
the patrick commons i o that's you know

1453
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,480
riddled with problems

1454
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,280
and

1455
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,559
how do you know whether it's being

1456
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,000
exposed or not

1457
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,440
do you really want to even you know

1458
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,040
expose your development teams to that

1459
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,280
kind of risk because you know they make

1460
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,520
some innocent change and suddenly

1461
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,440
induce a different section of the spring

1462
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,359
code base they're not spring experts we

1463
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:50,880
are spreading experts

1464
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,559
you know and you're like okay well is

1465
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,280
this likely to occur yes or no and

1466
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,640
you know hey guys you know that

1467
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,240
conversion is trying to release this to

1468
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,160
get rid of these problems

1469
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,520
and you know you can't really

1470
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,680
demonstrate that yeah i think we need

1471
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,280
more supply chain talks at the next law

1472
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,960
school

1473
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,800
all right well i've been told we're out

1474
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,550
of time here so thank you all

1475
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:16,649
[Applause]
