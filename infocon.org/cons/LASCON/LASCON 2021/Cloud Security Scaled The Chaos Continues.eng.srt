1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
so we are doing a cloud security chaos

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,119
part two i know that uh if you've if

3
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,119
you've seen any of these talks before uh

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,480
it's it's sort of a series of talks

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
we've been doing in the uh in cloud

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,920
security in the finance industry across

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,399
the board as we've uh as we've gotten

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,760
through a bunch of different

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
organizations so it's really a

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,840
consolidation of 30 or 40 uh

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,040
organizations that we've worked through

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,719
and the sort of security experiences

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
we've seen through that so i think the

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,800
first thing is you know one it's a

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,960
completely simpsons theme so come for

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,920
the

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,600
come for the gifts and the memes and

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
stay for the content

19
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,440
um and we will hopefully entertain you

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,199
if nothing else so uh i guess the next

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,039
thing is why listen to us

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
you know who are we

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,760
so i'll turn it over to mike first

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
yeah so hi i'm

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,559
mike mccabe

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
so i run a security consulting company

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
that focuses on application and

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
cloud security so i've been fortunate

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
enough to work with some really

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
interesting clients who are going

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
through kind of cloud migrations cloud

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
journeys either

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
on-prem

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
to cloud or just you know maturing their

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,280
cloud

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,040
program overall

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,080
so this talk is kind of um

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
kind of distilling a lot of what i've

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
learned working with those different

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
clients

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
some lessons learned and some trends and

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,320
things that have worked and things that

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
haven't worked

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,840
in one

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,400
talk

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
and i'm ken toler and i've been in the

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
industry for about a decade or so

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,240
and i've been back and forth between

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,759
consulting

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,200
and i spent four years running a

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
security team in a small fintech about

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
200 to 700 employees and so this is my

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,119
life most of the time just taking a lot

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
of punches you know trying to figure out

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
how to make things work and do this

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
systematically and in operations but

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,360
recently i switched back to consulting

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
so now i get to watch from the outside

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,960
and do all this uh do all this again and

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
try to bring some of that experience to

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
bear uh for for these teams uh so i'm

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,520
working a lot in you know devsecops

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,599
cloud security yeah security blockchain

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,920
security and so uh and now i'm back in

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,640
the consulting game and trying to change

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
the landscape

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
so we started this whole series about

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
five well not five years ago it seems

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,840
like five years ago so two years ago

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,160
three finance companies

71
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,680
but recently we've added another so

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
we've gotten up to four

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,959
um and that fourth one is introducing

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
sort of blockchain into this finance

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
with maggie smith so as i said all

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
simpsons theme

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,160
which sort of represents your startup

78
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,319
super startup blockchain organization

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,160
probably like one to three people uh

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,080
bart's bank is like your startup 20

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
people or so and themes that we are

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
facing there lisa's lending is like your

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
small medium size business 200 to 700

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,519
employees

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,599
and kind of how security grows there and

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,680
then homer's homeowners

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
is your super enterprise organization

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
thousands of employees large security

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
programs enterprise scale

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,640
so we'll kick it over to mike to talk

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
about homer's homeowners that's twice i

92
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
got that no that's good i'm not going to

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,120
try to say it because you guys have

94
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
already heard it twice so

95
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,879
uh to talk about to talk about that

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,920
start there

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
yeah so uh homer's homeowners kind of

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
represents it

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
some work that i've done with one client

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
that's a very large fortune 20 company

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
that

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
manages trillions of dollars worth of uh

103
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,680
worth of money and they um

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
they have been in the cloud for a long

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
time a pretty early adopter financial

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
world um but it was kind of they've now

107
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,400
kind of moved to the point where they're

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,159
trying to move completely off of on-prem

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
into the cloud so that's a big jump from

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
just having some stuff in the cloud some

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
stuff on-prem

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
um so they're pretty mature in the sense

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
that they have a lot of experience doing

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,519
uh

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,879
you know using the cloud and having

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
applications run there but there's still

117
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
a lot of complexity both from the fact

118
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
that it's a huge organization thousands

119
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
of applications um

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
they you know have some stuff on prem

121
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
some stuff moving

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
you've got some stuff moving to azure

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
um they're also regulated so that's

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,519
always kind of a facet of it as well

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
um

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,120
so they started out you know typical aws

127
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,720
user very simple architectures ec2 rds

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,600
maybe

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,240
you know some kind of load balancer

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,600
things over time got more and more

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
complex you know

132
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,680
they moved to more kind of api

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
integrations a lot more applications a

134
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,400
lot more aws service use

135
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
to where they are now

136
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,199
hundreds or if not thousands of

137
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
applications uh 300 plus aws accounts

138
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
some stuff in azure

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
and just crazy you know cutting edge

140
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,560
work to kind of control all this chaos

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
so

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
security along you know along with this

143
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
organization trying to

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
keep up with what the organization is

145
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,759
doing

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,120
trying to support it

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,199
without kind of hampering things so

148
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360
security has to keep up with all these

149
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
services everyone knows that

150
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
aws and azure and gcp they release new

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
services all the time

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
so security always has to keep up with

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
kind of supporting what the business

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
wants to use whether that's

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,919
container based stuff or

156
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
ai ml

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,919
or any just you know any other

158
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,240
service that the that the

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
application teams want to use

160
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
also supporting application patterns so

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,479
you know new ways for people to use

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
services

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,479
again this is you know when you're

164
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,039
managing 300 accounts you have to find a

165
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
very strategic way of managing network

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
patterns

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,919
um and on top of that dealing with kind

168
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,919
of inadequate security tooling

169
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
to kind of manage all these things

170
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,919
um

171
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,199
at the same time

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
uh security's trying to

173
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,759
kind of upskill and learn cloud so

174
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
there's a lot of talented apps like

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
people there's talented architects

176
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,639
who've done application architecture for

177
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
a long time but cloud is a very

178
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,919
different world

179
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,199
from those

180
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
from those areas so

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,639
i'm not sure if anyone's done hiring in

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,160
this industry but i've done a lot of

183
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,919
hiring for appsec folks and cloudtech

184
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,280
folks and i found it incredibly

185
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
difficult to find good apps like folks

186
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
now we're in the same spot with cloud

187
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
security

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
just not a lot of people have up-to-date

189
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
and kind of real in-depth experience

190
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
with cloud security

191
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,520
so that's kind of the challenges that

192
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
they're working with

193
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,160
so

194
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
what is working

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
uh they have patterns for how

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,440
applications are are built that works

197
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
well they have an account structure that

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
helps support their network patterns um

199
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
they have baselines to kind of push

200
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,360
those things make sure that they're um

201
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
you know that they're sticking to what

202
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
is the known good

203
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
um what's not working for them

204
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
deployments and what that means is you

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
know things get to the cloud in

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
different ways some stuff is manually

207
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,800
pushed

208
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
or changed some stuff is done through ci

209
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
cd there's not one pipeline for

210
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,479
everything

211
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,639
um the number of alerts when you have

212
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,720
300 accounts you have thousands of apps

213
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,680
you have

214
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,240
thousands of you know pretty much

215
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
everything s3 ec2 rds all of that stuff

216
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,199
you're going to see a lot of alerts

217
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,120
and what that leads to is someone

218
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,479
working to remediate these issues

219
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,840
working with

220
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
services teams trying to fix these

221
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
issues

222
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,319
and that process takes a very long time

223
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,240
and you can never you can never scale up

224
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
to the number of people

225
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
that you need to remediate all those and

226
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
you always are relying on app teams and

227
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,599
infrastructure to fix these issues so

228
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,720
that's kind of the areas that they're

229
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
struggling

230
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,599
so

231
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
they asked you know how do we solve this

232
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
issue how do we make things more uniform

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
how do we inject security at the

234
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,599
beginning

235
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
and so that's kind of the source of your

236
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
infrastructure

237
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
so i'm sure

238
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,560
a lot of folks here are familiar with

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
infrastructure as code if not um you

240
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
know it's basically

241
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,400
writing out code it's usually just kind

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,919
of a descriptive language not true

243
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,479
sometimes it is

244
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,879
and that that is used by either

245
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
something like cloud formation or

246
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
terraform or azure arm to deploy

247
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
infrastructure but just based on your

248
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,240
your

249
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,879
written code for that infrastructure

250
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,479
versus kind of going into the aws

251
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,800
console clicking you know give me an ec2

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
or you using the service catalog

253
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,479
something like that

254
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,760
um so

255
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
now this removes a lot of manual error

256
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
prone work for deployment

257
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
um you can

258
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,279
force code reviews you can

259
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
force linting tools security tools all

260
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,279
those kinds of things on top of this

261
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
process

262
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
and i think it's you know the last time

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
we did this talk i said that i think

264
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,240
cloud in general represents a huge uh

265
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
opportunity for you guys everything is

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
api driven everything is

267
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
you know data you can harvest and you

268
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,000
can action on you can fix things

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
immediately in the cloud

270
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,160
that's kind of the right tool set

271
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
and i think infrastructure's code is the

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,279
next kind of step

273
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,120
for that and that's where security as a

274
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
code comes in

275
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
so with security as code

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,120
you can write

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
you can write actual code

278
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,560
you know a lot of folks are familiar

279
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,959
with sas tools for application security

280
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,720
or even just writing regexes to look for

281
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
common issues

282
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
you know when we do assessments

283
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
using regex for some common issues is

284
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,320
pretty

285
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
pretty um

286
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
something we do pretty regularly

287
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
so this is just taking those kind of

288
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
same sas approaches to infrastructure as

289
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
code

290
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
this is it can scale to your cloud

291
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
program you're not having someone do

292
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
manual code review on your terraform

293
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,880
and you don't have to have you know

294
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
constant security input because you have

295
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
automation to handle a lot of that

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
so some of the common infrastructure

297
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
automation tools like i mentioned cloud

298
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
formation for aws

299
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,279
azure arm for azure and then terraform

300
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,800
which is multi-cloud so you can write

301
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
terraform and use it for aws or azure or

302
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
gcp it's not usually right

303
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
one file and it works across the board

304
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
but you can use one tool set to work

305
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
across the board

306
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,160
so one example

307
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
of how this infrastructure's code works

308
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
i've worked on a project for a long time

309
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,560
that's uh

310
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
using terraform

311
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
which is there it's a paid for

312
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,519
commercial product from hash corp but uh

313
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
it's an infrastructure's code

314
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,519
tool where

315
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,800
you have your you know you have your

316
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,320
terraform sitting in bcs github whatever

317
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,839
you send it out to do

318
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,959
a deployment so terraform does a plan

319
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,640
what that represents is what is actually

320
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
going to be going live or what you're

321
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,440
modifying or what you're destroying

322
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
and then you run these checks

323
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
sentinel checks against that and those

324
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,440
will do all of your security checks your

325
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
compliance checks all those things

326
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,680
against what is about to be deployed if

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
all those you know if all those are

328
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,399
green

329
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,920
you apply it and then you have

330
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
infrastructure

331
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
so some of the benefits

332
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
um you write this once you write all

333
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
your security policies once and they run

334
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,800
against any terraform any

335
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
you know cloud formation whatever your

336
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
whatever you're doing you're not having

337
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
to constantly rewrite a different tool

338
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,880
for a different scenario

339
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
um they're pretty high fidelity i'm used

340
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
to using sas tools

341
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,040
that give you a lot of false positives

342
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
these kind of tools these kind of rules

343
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,399
that you write

344
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,760
are generally pretty high quality

345
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
because you're writing them

346
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
customized to your environment

347
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
and so they're highly customizable

348
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,200
you can you can

349
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
make them as

350
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
you know unique as you need to be we

351
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
write ones that have unique regexes for

352
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
exactly what someone is looking for in a

353
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,760
naming standard for instance you can

354
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,160
make them very customizable

355
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,920
you can build an exception processes

356
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
into them which is really helpful if you

357
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
have

358
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
you know not everyone can always follow

359
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,000
all the rules you can build that in and

360
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
they're very fast we have one of the

361
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
projects i've worked on has 300 plus

362
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
rules and it runs in 10 to 30 seconds at

363
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
most so this isn't something like a sas

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
tool that's going to block your

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
developers from deploying infrastructure

366
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
for hours

367
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,839
so what are what does this actually look

368
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
like so this is a this is an example of

369
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,000
hashicorp

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,440
so um

371
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
this is just blocking kind of what what

372
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
ec2 types you can use so it's very

373
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
simple this is you know

374
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,880
less than 10 lines of actual code

375
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,399
so it's just defining your list of

376
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
what's allowed

377
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,200
ec2 instances from the plan

378
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
basically doing a filter to make sure

379
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,839
everything

380
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
all those things match

381
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
in terms of the instance type and then

382
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,519
checking if there are any violations

383
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,279
if that returns

384
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,600
false then you're good to go

385
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
this is an example of

386
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,920
of cflint which is a tool that aws

387
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,120
actually released

388
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,279
this is actually more of a it was

389
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,200
released as a code quality tool for

390
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
cloud formation but i worked on projects

391
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,760
where they've used this to basically do

392
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
security linting for

393
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,600
cloud formation

394
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,639
and then some folks are probably

395
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
familiar with semgrip which is a

396
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,160
semi-open source commercial product that

397
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
you write you write these rules for any

398
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
language

399
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,399
they have a terraform rule set that's

400
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
out there but again very customizable

401
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,839
and these are very

402
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,760
straightforward to write and again

403
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,200
pretty simple all in all it doesn't take

404
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,959
a huge amount of code to write these

405
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,160
things

406
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,279
so the point is these aren't massive

407
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,000
code projects that uh you know take

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,519
take months to get going you can write

409
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
these pretty quickly

410
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
so one of the things that

411
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,880
i've kind of learned from working on

412
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
these projects is

413
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
uh when you go to scale this and

414
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,519
eventually if you're a big enough

415
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
company you're going to want to scale

416
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,279
this um so

417
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,760
how do you scale out an iec project that

418
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,800
you know works for your large enterprise

419
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
so i think a lot of security projects

420
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
kind of end up or they started skunk

421
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
works and they kind of don't always

422
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
mature into

423
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
a full-on

424
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
project whereas i think if you want to

425
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,160
do this i would start from a very

426
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
security engineering

427
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,440
mindset as in build a security

428
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,800
engineering team

429
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,240
treat it like a development project and

430
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,839
by that i mean

431
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
use you know github or whatever source

432
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
using you have all the best practices

433
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
that you expect your developers to

434
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
to use um so git flow

435
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
peer reviews pull requests all those

436
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
types of things

437
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
then i think one thing um that i think

438
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
some security folks come from a

439
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,279
development background don't think about

440
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,480
they're not

441
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,600
they're not used to being in the

442
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
position of

443
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,800
pushing things to production and

444
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,199
actually having you know

445
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
having the responsibility to make sure

446
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
things work

447
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,639
so

448
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,600
when you write ise code to run against

449
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
people's production deployments your

450
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,120
production is their production and vice

451
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
versa so if you don't write good code if

452
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,040
it doesn't work as expected you're going

453
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,480
to break their production

454
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
and along with that is you know testing

455
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,519
you have to make sure that these are

456
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,240
well-tested rules

457
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
and

458
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
one thing we found is simulating actual

459
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
real-life scenarios is much harder than

460
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,920
just what you think or how you think

461
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,079
people are going to deploy things

462
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,000
and that also requires having

463
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
patterns of how people are going to

464
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,880
adopt this and then subject matter

465
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,680
expertise in those areas

466
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
another kind of philosophical

467
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,920
thing is are you going to give

468
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
developers kind of a playground where

469
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,519
there's loose guardrails and you're just

470
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,639
kind of enforcing

471
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
the worst or you're going to make paved

472
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
paths where there are very strict kind

473
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
of rules about how they adopt iec

474
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
so that's that's kind of two different

475
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
philosophies

476
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
so what can go wrong with these

477
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
um i think the big thing is security

478
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
doesn't always have all the context for

479
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,240
how people actually use

480
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
the cloud so you need to make sure that

481
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,440
you're living in the same world as your

482
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,720
users

483
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
that means writing rules that actually

484
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,920
fit to the models and patterns that

485
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,240
people are going to adopt when using

486
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,920
infrastructure

487
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
you have to be able to kind of root

488
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,959
cause and fix things very quickly

489
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,360
because if you're breaking

490
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
a production deployment you are on the

491
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
hook to fix that as soon as possible so

492
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
people can get to production

493
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
it's also very easy for these projects

494
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,759
to kind of scope creep

495
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,680
and that means kind of

496
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
applying these kind of

497
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
rules onto other facets of your

498
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
infrastructure security that might not

499
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,600
apply it's like patching

500
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
or scanning or kind of things like that

501
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
you might try to use them for too many

502
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
different applications

503
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
and sometimes that can be

504
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
that can be useful and it's a very

505
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,839
powerful tool but also if you start

506
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,440
trying to do everything in one tool set

507
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,279
you're probably just going to fail at it

508
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
overall

509
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
um and again if you don't have a unified

510
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
deployment model for how people will get

511
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,279
stuff out to the cloud you know you can

512
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,720
write a thousand checks but if no one's

513
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
actually using your pipeline and are

514
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,920
forced to go through this then it

515
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,279
doesn't matter

516
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,639
um and then

517
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
lack of integration with runtime so

518
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
terraform and quadformation they do this

519
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
kind of pre-deployment

520
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
check to make sure like what is reality

521
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,520
and what is about to be deployed but

522
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,119
that's only kind of what you're talking

523
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
to and what you're modifying it doesn't

524
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
always apply for all the other kind of

525
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,760
resources out there

526
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
your runtime so some of those kind of

527
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,919
dependencies relationships you might not

528
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,839
have the insight into with these kind of

529
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,959
tools because they're only running

530
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,439
against the code

531
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
so to kind of summarize homer's

532
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,720
homeowners so

533
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
they're a large enterprise they've been

534
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
doing cloud for a long time struggling

535
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,160
to deal with this complexity over time

536
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,520
and they're trying to move to this model

537
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,600
and they've done a lot of work to move

538
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
to this model where they're fixing

539
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
things

540
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,280
they're not allowing things to go out

541
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
the door broken

542
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
behind it and fix them

543
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,880
afterwards and they can also scale up

544
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
this program to meet kind of you know

545
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,720
the next

546
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,280
100 300 aws accounts thousands of

547
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,039
applications that are coming out

548
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,400
uh

549
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,880
from their development

550
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,080
behind

551
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
all right so lisa's lending

552
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,000
uh think of lisa's lending as like your

553
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,480
200 to 700 person uh company um that's

554
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,120
got like a really great finance industry

555
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
product they're

556
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,039
[Music]

557
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,400
filling some like sort of niche in the

558
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,679
market and they're super successful in

559
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,240
doing that they've got devops and uh

560
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,200
these processes that are are mature and

561
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
working and they're really you know

562
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,720
hitting the ground running so if you

563
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,520
were um if you had attended the previous

564
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
talks you

565
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,720
would have realized that we identified

566
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,000
three major problems in these sort of

567
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
organizations the complexity of those

568
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
organizations so what tools they're

569
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
using what tech stacks they have

570
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,679
and then not only that but the

571
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,520
complexity of all of the integration

572
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
that they use because when these

573
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
organizations spin up a lot of what they

574
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
do is outsource

575
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,919
some of the functions that they don't

576
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,600
want to spend time developing so that

577
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,919
can be your identity

578
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,640
your payments your funding sources maybe

579
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,960
some underwriting or

580
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
the world equifax things like that and

581
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
so having to manage all those is sort of

582
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,200
like a supply chain issue

583
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,559
the other thing is regulation is

584
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,679
constantly coming into these

585
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
organizations as well most common ones

586
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,919
you'll think of is like pci socks suck

587
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,160
too but some of these organizations

588
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
don't handle credit cards or they

589
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,360
outsource it so they don't actually

590
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
lean on pci so that's something to

591
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
consider and then

592
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,039
a unique issue is if they are trying to

593
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,640
partner with something that's like a

594
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
bigger bank or like a larger institution

595
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
a lot of times those financial

596
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
institutions have to meet some sort of

597
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,919
criteria for their auditors and are

598
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
asking their

599
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,280
the folks that they are integrating with

600
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,360
to meet the requirements of that without

601
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
actually filling the audit before that

602
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,120
larger institution is actually doing it

603
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
themselves so they don't have to worry

604
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
about it in the future

605
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
and the last piece is legacy hardware

606
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,320
and software and that was how do we

607
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
solve for integrating you know things

608
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,520
like uh react and node.js apps with a

609
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,919
mainframe you know really scenarios like

610
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
that and how we can pass through and

611
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
filter data and what does that security

612
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,159
look like in that cloud infrastructure

613
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
and architecture when we're migrating a

614
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
business like this to the cloud so we

615
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
did work through all of that uh and

616
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
we'll explain as quickly as we can how

617
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
we got there uh but one of the things

618
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,240
that sort of popped up after we've

619
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
gotten through all that and sort of felt

620
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
like we were in a good secure place was

621
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
just comfort with the cloud so we went

622
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,960
from having these organizations that

623
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
were like really uncomfortable with the

624
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
cloud and working on migrating

625
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,200
and reaching this sort of i won't say

626
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
lazy but just like what do we do next

627
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,880
kind of thing

628
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,400
i also want to talk about this image

629
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
because this image comes up all the time

630
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,240
and it frustrates me to no end and even

631
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,159
two weeks ago this came up in the same

632
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
context and i think that it's because

633
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
this is marketed to business owners to

634
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,159
like how what's your responsibility

635
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,080
inside of cloud security and i'm

636
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,440
constantly coming up against this and

637
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,799
they're like oh software as a service we

638
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,159
don't have to worry about any security

639
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,080
like salesforce will take care of it or

640
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
whatever your sas provider is going to

641
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,159
take

642
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,000
but you do have responsibilities for the

643
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,840
configuration of those tools in each of

644
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,679
these sections that is really important

645
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,360
for you to consider so if you're using a

646
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,679
platform as a service like eks you're

647
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,520
still responsible for understanding and

648
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,559
configuring eks at the network storage

649
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,480
layer and aws will provide you with the

650
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
best practice on how to do that

651
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,080
but you're still responsible for that

652
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
security and i think that this sort of

653
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,559
like transforms the shared

654
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,240
responsibility model in a way that's not

655
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,039
great

656
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
so as you're looking at this and

657
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,919
more about that um just be aware that

658
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
this does not relate to uh like your

659
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,679
security responsibility in an

660
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,840
organization

661
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
so the way that we solved the problem in

662
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,559
the initial set of complex complex

663
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,960
issues was through this

664
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,039
enabling and enhancing

665
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,320
application and development and

666
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
operations teams so we have a tendency

667
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,679
in the security to think of how do i

668
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,320
solve the security problem and so we and

669
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
adoption becomes our biggest enemy of

670
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,919
whatever we're trying to implement and

671
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
so every time we implemented something

672
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,000
uh inside of these organizations one of

673
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,440
the things we asked ourselves is how can

674
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
we

675
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,240
have some enhancement to time money or

676
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
effort for development teams or

677
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
operations teams

678
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
the two major initiatives that worked or

679
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
like prove this concept was key key and

680
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
secret management and stability i'll

681
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,799
just focus on one just in the interest

682
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,880
of time but in the key and secret

683
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
management like one of the big wins that

684
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
we had was we were thinking about uh we

685
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,799
need to change our strategy for how we

686
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,400
manage keys and secrets because we know

687
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,240
there's an issue there

688
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
the compliance organization was saying

689
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,280
you need to have you know this

690
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
expiration date this rotation mechanism

691
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
this length of characters in your

692
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,840
secrets or this type of key management

693
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
we were like well how can we use that

694
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
compliance goal to set a bar that's

695
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
going to actually change the

696
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
game for our developers and our

697
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
engineers to make sure that we are

698
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
actually enabling them rather than just

699
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
adding another security control the way

700
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,480
that we did that was through hashicorp

701
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
vault so we used to have this large

702
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,799
process where we would manually rotate

703
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,440
secrets like 30 or 40 people between

704
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,480
database

705
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
admins devops engineers the actual

706
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
security engineers that are working on

707
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
there and the the admins of the

708
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,559
development teams that are doing this

709
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
because they're configuring it in their

710
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,440
apps

711
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,799
we pulled down

712
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,720
vault

713
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
had a goal of aggressive um rotation

714
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,679
times aggressive expiration times we

715
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,679
were enabling things like auto every

716
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,039
time you reboot the application it would

717
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
rotate the secret we had a break last

718
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,159
procedure so all these things were

719
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,080
adding security mechanisms but at the

720
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,440
end of the day we're also trying to be

721
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
considerate of when an application team

722
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,600
needs to access their app how do they

723
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
get that secret and if they do have to

724
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
require that secret for maintenance or

725
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
whatever how do we rotate it immediately

726
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
so it was all configured to rotate

727
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
so it was trying to take that approach

728
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
of enabling them while we're adding the

729
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,919
security control and meeting that

730
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,799
compliance requirement

731
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,960
so uh this is just a sort of an aside of

732
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,720
where we're going with this so regulated

733
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,960
financial services all the complexity

734
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
legacy requirements and all that kind of

735
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
thing can be a cloud hell just like ned

736
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
flanders here going into his own

737
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
personal hell uh but if you spend enough

738
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
time doing it and you set the bar you

739
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,279
can act you know you can become your own

740
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,080
worst enemy

741
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,520
so

742
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
like sort of understanding in these

743
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,559
organizations from having this like

744
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
complete cloud confusion to now we're

745
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,919
confident in the cloud everybody's

746
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,200
confident knowing what the security

747
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,799
requirements are we're hitting our

748
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,919
compliance

749
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,919
goals every single day or every time an

750
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,120
audit comes up we know exactly what

751
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,000
we're doing

752
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,520
easier and easier

753
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,200
and we've getting this we've gotten into

754
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
this sort of rhythm of having this cloud

755
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,039
confidence but then we get sort of

756
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,760
overconfident more like okay everybody

757
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,279
you know we can do this on our own we

758
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,720
know what security wants and what

759
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,039
security is doing and so they start to

760
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
you start to get a bit of shadow i.t

761
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
inside the cloud because people become

762
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,679
more and more confident with it and we

763
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,760
were realizing we had no bar or

764
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,080
measurement outside of compliance to say

765
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,279
even though we were trying to do more

766
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
than compliance and make sure that we

767
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,200
were doing more than checking the box

768
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,679
once we hit that goal we had no

769
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
difference no delta in the measuring

770
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,799
stick and so we couldn't actually move

771
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,720
it forward with any with anything to

772
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,760
show them

773
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,640
so

774
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
obviously that resulted in some some

775
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,559
issues in the cloud and so you know your

776
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
security guard

777
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,279
so what were our failures the biggest

778
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,840
thing was we were focusing on we weren't

779
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
we knew we didn't want to do checkbox

780
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,039
security because nobody wants to do that

781
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,640
but we focused on compliance as our

782
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,559
measuring tool even though we were going

783
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,880
above and beyond and that

784
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,279
inward focus of we still hit the target

785
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,400
and we didn't know where to go from

786
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
there so we had lacks of gap and

787
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,320
measurement that we couldn't really use

788
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,279
to facilitate selling that inward to uh

789
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,360
management things of that nature so we

790
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
needed to change that and the criteria

791
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
we came up with was we don't want to

792
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
drive it with money uh because that

793
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,919
means that we're gonna have to buy

794
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,600
something new and that goes against that

795
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,679
sort of time mechanism

796
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,200
not if we don't want it to be driven by

797
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
compliance because we that was our

798
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,320
failure we needed something that was

799
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
going to create something actionable for

800
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
us to do we wanted to keep that sort of

801
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
enabling mindset of making sure that

802
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,320
we're focusing on team successes

803
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,919
and we wanted to focus on maturity of

804
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,440
the organization over time rather than

805
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
like hitting some metric that we set out

806
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,679
at the uh the beginning of it and that

807
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,200
uh

808
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
flexible and what goals we could set we

809
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
wanted to make sure that uh just because

810
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
the whatever we decide to use says one

811
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
thing we may or may not agree with it

812
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,760
and we wanted to be able to self-assess

813
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,799
we didn't want to have to hire an

814
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,400
auditor to come and tell us what was

815
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
going on

816
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,039
so we evaluated a couple of different

817
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,840
things uh sam ions and the devsecops

818
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,679
maturity model the ins cloud security

819
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,640
maturity model and oauth sam and we

820
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,159
started to go with o-wasp sam and if you

821
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,440
want to talk about sort of why we didn't

822
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,440
decide for something else we can talk

823
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,480
about that

824
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,640
but the oauth sam provides this sort of

825
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
really interesting viewpoint i know it's

826
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,559
not cloud specific but the reason we

827
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,840
really liked it is because it separates

828
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
things into business functions it

829
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,799
doesn't have this like goal that you

830
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
have to hit like maturity level one or

831
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
maturity level two you could sort of

832
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,240
pick and choose what business functions

833
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
matter to you in that moment and it

834
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
allowed you to have this objective

835
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,279
measurement you could self-assess you

836
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,039
can provide these things to teams or you

837
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,400
can have somebody help that with

838
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
somebody more familiar with security to

839
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
help you with that process

840
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
so we really like that it allowed us to

841
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
get that measuring stick

842
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
try to show progress to the organization

843
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
and get everyone back on the same page

844
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
and out of like some compliance metric

845
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
while still meeting those compliance

846
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
goals

847
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
and that turns us right back over to

848
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,400
bart somebody

849
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,520
uh it's like 20 people 20 30 people

850
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
yeah this

851
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
this kind of represents the opposite of

852
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
of homer's homeowner so

853
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
uh during kind of our time working with

854
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,120
different companies we've worked these

855
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
smaller companies that

856
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
you know i think representative startups

857
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
are just kind of 100-person companies

858
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
that

859
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
they have you know decent number of

860
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,960
developers

861
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
but they don't have a dedicated uh

862
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
security team you know they're all cloud

863
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
they were never on-prem relatively new

864
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,840
but still regulated and so a lot of

865
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,159
sensitive customer data

866
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
this could be a fintech or you know

867
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
education tech or you know a lot of

868
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
different kind of companies that are in

869
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,720
this spot

870
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,279
um so they're all adopting cloud

871
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,880
and they don't know where to start with

872
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,279
their cloud security um

873
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,320
so

874
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,399
some of the common issues we see

875
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
uh not technical issues but you know

876
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,919
their security is really driven by

877
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
audits what do they have to do every

878
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
year in order to make their customers

879
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,640
happier

880
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
lack of security tooling and staff so

881
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
they don't they don't put a budget

882
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,000
towards either one of these things

883
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
besides kind of a quarterly or annual

884
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
audit

885
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,840
um

886
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
and just short timelines as well small

887
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,799
business is usually pretty timeline and

888
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,360
financially driven versus kind of we

889
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
want to make sure our security is really

890
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,799
strong

891
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,080
um so what do we see kind of on the

892
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
security side with a lot of these

893
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
companies it's really it comes down to

894
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,880
the basics so

895
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
um

896
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
i was looking at some of the the work

897
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,440
that we've done some of the reports and

898
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
it came down to kind of basic things so

899
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,080
amazingly logging despite it being very

900
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,640
easy in the cloud is one big issue that

901
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
we see um you know

902
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,279
if you can't tell me who did something

903
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,760
in your cloud more than 90 days ago then

904
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
you're not doing a good job of vlogging

905
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,600
and these days you know enabling

906
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,840
cloudtrail takes 30 seconds and it

907
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,200
doesn't cost you that much money just to

908
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,799
put the logs into

909
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,799
s3

910
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,399
and so it's really there's not many

911
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,919
great excuses to not have these kind of

912
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,279
logs enabled

913
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
but it's a pretty common issue that we

914
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,080
see

915
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
another one is encryption so

916
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,240
cloud encryption is is more of a

917
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
checkbox than anything else unless you

918
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
really don't trust aws with your

919
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,000
uh data which you know there's a million

920
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,840
other ways they can access it if

921
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,000
if um you didn't

922
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
even if you're encrypted but

923
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,399
we see a lot of you know unencrypted

924
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,200
uh

925
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,840
data on rds on s3

926
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,399
ebs all these types of things and again

927
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,760
in the cloud these kind of things are

928
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
very easy to address it's as simple as a

929
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,080
checkbox so you don't have to

930
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
go through some very you know complex

931
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,919
way to actually get this data encrypted

932
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
they can do all the key management

933
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
very straightforward

934
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,640
and then lastly uh kind of identity and

935
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,720
user management um a lot of companies

936
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,399
i've worked with they don't have

937
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,240
a strong user management kind of program

938
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
and that spills over into the cloud

939
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
where they might not know who has access

940
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
to what and they don't do a good job of

941
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
managing their users

942
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
and for some of them that you know do

943
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039
have spent some time building out at

944
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,520
least buying you know a security tool

945
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
a lot of these folks buy a tool

946
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,360
their cloud and it's sitting there it's

947
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
you know harvesting data it's throwing

948
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
up alerts

949
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
but it's kind of like a lighthouse that

950
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
no one looks at because

951
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,880
there might be a thousand words but if

952
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
no one's going in to look at them and go

953
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,039
and fix the issues you know they might

954
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
as well not

955
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,760
the money on that tool

956
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,200
another issue i see quite a bit is

957
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
data sprawl where they'll have a decent

958
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,279
amount of sensitive data which probably

959
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,039
just live in like you know an rds

960
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,600
instance or something like that but they

961
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,519
for whatever reason um you know maybe

962
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,519
it's data scientists or just another

963
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,960
project that needs access to that data

964
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
so they copy it to say an s3 or they

965
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,000
copy it to an evs volume and just over

966
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
time that data just kind of goes

967
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,919
everywhere and they don't have

968
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,919
you know a data management program that

969
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,440
says okay where all the places that we

970
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,559
have data

971
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,760
how do we

972
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
you know make sure that it's only

973
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
accessed by the people who

974
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,320
should have access and how do we you

975
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,840
know work on those

976
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,640
uh those unapproved

977
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
that's something you see in large

978
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,120
companies but usually large companies

979
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,360
have you know data custodians and

980
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,039
programs around that so small companies

981
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,559
don't have that but they have the same

982
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,679
issue with

983
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,480
their data kind of going everywhere

984
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,679
um

985
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,200
and multi-process

986
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,039
that's definitely a hot topic in the

987
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,799
cloud world in terms of

988
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,600
large companies trying to

989
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,000
go to multi-cloud some people feel like

990
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
it's a way to avoid vendor lock-in

991
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,360
some people are just looking for a

992
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,679
cheaper service potentially

993
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,120
what i'm seeing with smaller companies

994
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
is usually they start with one cloud so

995
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,799
they'll have most of their applications

996
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,519
on ec2 and aws but they're actually will

997
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,200
pick you know a couple azure services

998
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
that they like for you know some

999
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,399
specific application

1000
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,440
that's all well and good you know

1001
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,000
different clouds offer different um kind

1002
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
of strengths but what you then have is

1003
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,320
you have multiple clouds you have data

1004
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
in multiple places you don't have a way

1005
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,279
to

1006
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,799
you know work on those different clouds

1007
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,080
you don't have a security tool for those

1008
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
different

1009
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,720
managing identity in those two different

1010
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,519
clouds network and so it's just the more

1011
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
the more platforms you adopt the more

1012
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,039
your kind of responsibility to uh

1013
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,799
to secure these and people don't always

1014
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,559
have the skill set or the budget or the

1015
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,519
tools to do that

1016
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,200
so what should you do

1017
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,640
really start with the basics if you're a

1018
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,519
small

1019
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,440
company that is using the cloud really

1020
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
just adopt the basics so what does that

1021
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,840
mean

1022
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
having you know logging for all your

1023
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,880
services set up

1024
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,960
um that's again very straightforward and

1025
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,039
simple one will if you ever have some

1026
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,559
kind of incident or breach that's going

1027
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,640
to pay dividends um

1028
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
for a long time

1029
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,880
uh identity federation so figure out how

1030
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
you're going to manage your identity

1031
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,279
there's a lot of different options these

1032
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,799
days even on the

1033
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
cheaper so you can use something like g

1034
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,760
suite you can use octa you can even use

1035
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,000
azure ad and then federate that into aws

1036
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
um and have a wording i mean even the

1037
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
basic budget awarding is really helpful

1038
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,720
small companies they don't have an

1039
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,279
official security tool to do that

1040
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
and then try to figure out kind of a

1041
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,399
unified deployment process for how you

1042
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,760
get things into

1043
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,840
the cloud and standardize on that so

1044
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,440
everyone is using

1045
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,000
kind of the same method

1046
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,320
all right so now we're at the smallest

1047
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,039
organization uh in the series of four

1048
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,120
maggies mint and

1049
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,279
this is representative we'll call it you

1050
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,519
know five to ten different blockchain

1051
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,600
organizations i've had the uh

1052
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,279
really fortunate opportunity to work

1053
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,799
with over the probably last year and a

1054
00:33:58,799 --> 00:33:59,919
half or so

1055
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,919
and um we added this to the finance

1056
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,159
thing because you know i don't know if

1057
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,559
if you saw the blockchain uh talk

1058
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,280
yesterday uh it was uh it was sort of it

1059
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,480
can be eye-opening if you've never

1060
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
looked at this stuff before and in a

1061
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,320
cloud security talk uh there's a there's

1062
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,679
a footprint here that i really like to

1063
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,399
sort of address so a typical sort of

1064
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,079
organization that we're looking at here

1065
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,399
is uh we'll call maggie's mint maggie

1066
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,199
her new token her doggy coin here about

1067
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,359
santa's little helper uh and she is you

1068
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,079
know ready to to get this going it's one

1069
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,239
uh developer slash engineer uh working

1070
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,040
in working on this uh on this project

1071
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,280
she wants to have not only something on

1072
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,639
the blockchain but she wants to be able

1073
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,639
to have this community that is like

1074
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,040
interactive people can transfer tokens

1075
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
and do all kinds of things with each

1076
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,040
other maybe fund their wallets from

1077
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
banks and things like that so a typical

1078
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,639
organization

1079
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,480
like this is a small team

1080
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
probably like one to three people to

1081
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,040
start out with and we've seen you know a

1082
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
variety of different sizes here but this

1083
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,720
is a you know it there are some that are

1084
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
just like maybe one or two teams or

1085
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
sorry one or two people or a really tiny

1086
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
team maybe like of three or four

1087
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,560
blockchain developers

1088
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,880
there's also this sort of lack of cloud

1089
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,040
knowledge and support so when they are

1090
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,800
doing anything establish any

1091
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
infrastructure in the cloud they're sort

1092
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,079
of doing it how they know they're

1093
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,760
they're not really trained in cloud

1094
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,520
security or cloud knowledge and they are

1095
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,119
doing the best that they can with that

1096
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,640
uh sort of going back to that knowledge

1097
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
gap that that mike had talked about

1098
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,160
between security and cloud same kind of

1099
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,119
thing

1100
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,480
there's also this like really weird

1101
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,400
extreme trust in the blockchain that as

1102
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,760
much as as long as i put it on the

1103
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,240
blockchain it's cryptographically secure

1104
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
so i'll just focus on those things and

1105
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,359
nothing else

1106
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,280
and there's also the sort of uh in that

1107
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
same vein this idea that the client side

1108
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,839
the javascript application in web3 that

1109
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,119
connects to the blockchain we don't have

1110
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,960
to worry about that because as long as

1111
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
the blockchain's secure

1112
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,560
so there's like sort of that mentality

1113
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,599
as well

1114
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,400
the other two interesting things is one

1115
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,079
just open source contributions to these

1116
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,320
projects some of these projects get uh

1117
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,160
you know their development team is

1118
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,760
literally like mozbar right it's just

1119
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
everybody that wants to contribute

1120
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,200
they're chatting they're you know

1121
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,560
they're they're solving each other's

1122
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,760
problems and it's a really great

1123
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
community but at the same time there's a

1124
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,359
security risk that we all know goes into

1125
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,119
open source projects as it is and now

1126
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,359
you're talking about a finance project

1127
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,280
that is public that is allowing people

1128
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,760
to submit code and all the problems that

1129
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,359
come along with that so think of your

1130
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,800
supply chain attacks and things of that

1131
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,680
nature but with a finance institution

1132
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,079
the last thing is sometimes a lack of a

1133
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,240
dedicated security team we see a lot of

1134
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
these organizations focusing on bug

1135
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
bounty programs but they don't have

1136
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
necessarily a dedicated security team or

1137
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,480
their security team isn't uh like cloud

1138
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,160
security or infrastructure security

1139
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,240
they're more like application security

1140
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,560
engineers that focus on a very specific

1141
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
uh nuanced security inside of smart

1142
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,480
contracts

1143
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,800
so that's where we're starting

1144
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
and there's also this sort of leadership

1145
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
persona uh that i've sort of started to

1146
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,160
notice there there's like three sort of

1147
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
i would say like folks that you sort of

1148
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,400
talk to if we had to put them into

1149
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,800
buckets one is like i'm doing the smart

1150
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
i'm doing this smart contract i don't

1151
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,920
really

1152
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,359
everything that the user does if they

1153
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,599
connect their wallet to my my system

1154
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,599
it's their problem if they mismanage

1155
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,200
their funds or whatever it is like i

1156
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,480
don't really care i'm just going to

1157
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
provide it make sure my smart contract

1158
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,520
is secure and everything else is on them

1159
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,760
the other like sort of middle ground is

1160
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,880
folks that

1161
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,800
want to protect their users or want to

1162
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
protect their user base and their brand

1163
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,160
but don't necessarily have the knowledge

1164
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,000
in cloud or

1165
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
maybe the resources to do so and the

1166
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,280
last are like people that are

1167
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
evangelical about protecting their user

1168
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,960
base their market their brand making

1169
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
sure that they're changing you know sort

1170
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
of they're doing this for the future and

1171
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,440
they really want to know all these

1172
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,800
things maybe they don't have the budget

1173
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,440
or the knowledge to know

1174
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,560
so really the the way that we can kind

1175
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
of play as traditional security

1176
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,920
engineers or cloud security engineers is

1177
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
sort of on the right side of this in the

1178
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,520
i don't know or protect them all phase

1179
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
so what's a common cloud security

1180
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,400
architecture for a blockchain

1181
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,960
organization like at this size

1182
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,440
this is really simplified from you know

1183
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
what we've seen but typically you have

1184
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
something like maggie snowball and you

1185
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
know santa's little helper starting

1186
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,560
their blockchain organization they're

1187
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,079
deployed on kubernetes maybe they're in

1188
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,720
eks for the for the ui or something

1189
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,079
but they maybe haven't gone through the

1190
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,720
best practice in aws kind of guide um

1191
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,760
they have rds but that rds instance is

1192
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,599
storing things like user keys or private

1193
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
information and they've maybe enabled

1194
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,119
encryption maybe they haven't but

1195
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,720
they're not necessarily aware of things

1196
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,880
like um the

1197
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
parameter store or secrets manager or

1198
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,119
hashicorp vault like we talked about

1199
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,040
before and so they're trying their best

1200
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,400
to use what they know to fulfill the

1201
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
need that they have

1202
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,839
though i've seen things like ebs for

1203
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,359
file upload

1204
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,240
nfts and stuff but they're not encrypted

1205
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,520
and because they're on the back end so

1206
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
there's this assumed trust behind the

1207
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
wall behind the load balancer

1208
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,119
we've seen the same thing at public s3

1209
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,960
buckets you know all the common problems

1210
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
we go through uh but for things that

1211
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,119
they don't consider necessarily assets

1212
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,720
all those open source contributions we

1213
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,960
talked about and then again no security

1214
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,200
team

1215
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,760
so i think what i want to sort of drive

1216
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
home here is that it's really easy to

1217
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,720
point the finger and be like

1218
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,800
uh they don't know what they're doing

1219
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
cloud security is things that they're

1220
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,320
they're failing at but just like there's

1221
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,240
a gap in cloud security and uh

1222
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,880
application security um i think that

1223
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,079
like they're gonna know things that you

1224
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,440
don't know and we're going to know

1225
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
things that they don't know and we sort

1226
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,160
of need to like cross the aisle a little

1227
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,440
bit here and

1228
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,599
help them understand you know where

1229
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,040
their security footprint and their

1230
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
attack surface actually is and that it

1231
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,920
goes beyond the blockchain

1232
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,880
so

1233
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
how do we do that for me uh in the last

1234
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,320
year and a half i found some real

1235
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,040
models um and really just starting with

1236
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,320
a basic threat model um if you can get a

1237
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,839
blockchain organization in the room or

1238
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,599
if somebody if you are working on an

1239
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,720
organization that is looking at

1240
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,000
blockchain

1241
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,680
start with the basics of a threat model

1242
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,000
ask what goes into the entire ecosystem

1243
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,440
of what you're developing

1244
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,040
stride is okay i've had people ask me

1245
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,160
like

1246
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,720
what is stride and why does it why does

1247
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,000
it matter for blockchain i thought that

1248
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,599
was something for like applications and

1249
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,359
you're like but you are an application

1250
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,200
so you know or

1251
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
you strive for anything so it's like

1252
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,800
trying to describe what it is and how it

1253
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,480
fits their world is a really important

1254
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,599
thing

1255
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,760
draw a diagram get drawing a lot of

1256
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,440
these organizations have really good

1257
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
white papers really good research really

1258
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,000
good cryptographic analysis really good

1259
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
diagrams but they don't necessarily have

1260
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,160
an architecture diagram that tells you

1261
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,839
what is like the holistic view of their

1262
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,760
entire ecosystem and what's their

1263
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,680
infrastructure architecture look like if

1264
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
you draw that for them you're providing

1265
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,040
them with one a threat model and two a

1266
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,960
diagram that they haven't taken

1267
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,079
or do

1268
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,920
it also helps you create an inventory

1269
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,280
that you can continue to walk through

1270
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
threats with and then build on that

1271
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,599
and just assume nothing like even if you

1272
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,200
just take a best practice guide to that

1273
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,960
conversation i think you'll find

1274
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,119
something

1275
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,280
uh so how do you join the crypto party

1276
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,880
and like you know if you're if your

1277
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,119
company is in crypto or you're trying or

1278
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,880
like involved in that conversation

1279
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,520
somehow again document and draw things

1280
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,280
review client applications don't just

1281
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
assume that the javascript is

1282
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
going to be completely safe there is a

1283
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,839
there is an attack surface there a

1284
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,359
threat model at the not only the

1285
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,800
blockchain level but at the component

1286
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,240
infrastructure level

1287
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,760
uh identify and know the trust

1288
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,359
boundaries of where your application is

1289
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,880
and review the security controls that

1290
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,960
are there and talk to security people

1291
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,200
like just pick security people's brains

1292
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,040
and because they spend all time all

1293
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
their time trying to think about how to

1294
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,720
break things and defend things and you

1295
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
know let them let them loose on that

1296
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
sort of organization

1297
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,839
and that wraps up the maggie's mint so i

1298
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,520
guess the next question is what can i do

1299
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
today

1300
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,319
so

1301
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,160
all of these like we said have very very

1302
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,200
common themes across finance and so

1303
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,720
i think that we can sort of break this

1304
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,839
down into four areas the first is focus

1305
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,000
on enabling teams over just attaching

1306
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,280
security

1307
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
make sure that what you're doing is

1308
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,359
changing the status quo of not only the

1309
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,359
security in your teams but also what

1310
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,400
what they

1311
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,920
can do on a day-to-day basis how do you

1312
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,160
make their job easier how do you enable

1313
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
them faster

1314
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,440
and enhance the speed you know i think

1315
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,880
is measurement i think that you know

1316
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
we've we're always sort of having these

1317
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
really crappy kpis and security like the

1318
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,839
number of vulnerabilities or you know

1319
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,760
all these kinds of things so

1320
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,839
it's like find a measurement that works

1321
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,920
that will allow you to

1322
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,200
establish trend lines in your

1323
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,520
organization for your security uh and

1324
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,640
measure like we were talking about with

1325
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,119
the oauth sam like a delta between what

1326
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,520
you're doing set a goal get there you

1327
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,359
know set your next goal be able to

1328
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,440
actually show improvement over time and

1329
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,680
i think that over time is the key there

1330
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
uh and mike you could talk about the

1331
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,480
other two

1332
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
yeah the other two are kind of deep

1333
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
winds which we mean by that uh can coin

1334
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,359
that over whiskey so

1335
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,200
not understanding it but

1336
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
where can you where can you solve an

1337
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
issue that you know

1338
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
you solve at one place and it kind of

1339
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,560
has a domino effect across multiple

1340
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,400
areas that's what we saw with homer's

1341
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,240
homeowners with kind of addressing

1342
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,680
security at the root of where uh

1343
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,839
cloud resources are deployed and that

1344
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,280
kind of gives you benefits in a lot of

1345
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,040
different areas

1346
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,720
and then for smaller companies or just

1347
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,040
kind of less mature places just cover

1348
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,520
your basics you know a lot of people

1349
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,720
we focus on zero days we focus on

1350
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,480
the attacks but really the basics are

1351
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,920
still not covered in a lot of places so

1352
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,520
make sure that those are

1353
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,800
are covered first

1354
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
so what have we learned um you know i

1355
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,800
think what ken and i have learned from

1356
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,160
kind of our experience doing this is

1357
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,440
cloud security

1358
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,200
scale uh small or large or medium size

1359
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,280
it's just a hard challenge

1360
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,680
so you have to plan early and adapt

1361
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,560
often

1362
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,400
so have a plan and then be ready to

1363
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,760
adapt that as

1364
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,319
you know new services or new strategies

1365
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,640
or just new patterns are adopted and

1366
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
then just be comfortable with complexity

1367
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,359
and acknowledge your risk trade-offs

1368
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,800
anything else you want to add

1369
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
no but if you do bring down production

1370
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,800
and you'll be in bart shoes here

1371
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,040
um the uh

1372
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,520
basically just uh you know

1373
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,880
kind of see the common themes across

1374
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,560
finance in no matter what technology

1375
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,400
stack you're looking at if you uh want

1376
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
