00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:18,800
[Music]

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,080
so the main step we're going to talk

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
about today is uh devsecops and shifting

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
security left

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,840
how to build your development muscles

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,519
getting good at writing software design

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,519
docs and then making engineering and

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
security partnerships repeatable

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
i think

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
at this point most attendees are bought

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
into the idea of

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,120
working with and enabling developers and

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
moving beyond the department of no we

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,399
saw this work really well with devops

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
because this led to software teams being

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,079
able to ship

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
products faster and safer and it also

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,320
led to software engineers learning more

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
about infrastructure

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,559
as well as infrastructure folks becoming

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,079
more like software engineers to things

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,160
like infrastructure and code and moving

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,319
away from just a bunch of like random

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,040
scripts and actually uh codifying things

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
and having it be version controlled and

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,439
being able to track who's making changes

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,439
devstech ops is really a similar idea

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,000
let's continue to shop to ship software

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
quickly but let's also do it securely i

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,640
think devsecops is great for security

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
because it lowers the barrier to

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
shipping new software

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,560
a lot of security teams

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,439
you know

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
historically have thought that that's

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
counter-intuitive because there's less

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,119
checks it's you know you don't have time

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,840
to to review everything but uh to me the

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,439
faster you can ship software the faster

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,200
you can fix things there's always going

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
to be vulnerabilities in software and if

42
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
you lower the barrier to fixing p3s p4s

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,040
p2s

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
the more likely somebody is going to do

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
them because people like it when things

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
are easy

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,079
as part of shifting left security has

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,240
really jumped on the opportunity to have

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,719
devs sharing in the security burden

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,640
um we know that developers are always

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,479
going to outnumber security folks and

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,079
security can't be a

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
tech technological expert on everything

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
that your company uses

55
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,598
um

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,360
shifting left also means that security

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
is just a component of good software and

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
devs want to build good software they

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
want it to be scalable they want it to

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
have a good user interface they want it

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
to be reliable having software be secure

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
is just another foundational component

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
of building a good piece of software

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,680
but to do that devs need to be security

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
minded and it's security's job to help

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
them uh these people may not have had a

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
lot of experience in the security space

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
and your team should be enabling these

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
people to make good security decisions

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,000
without you that should be the goal

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
i think the natural intersection of

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
security and engineering is actually

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
security features

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
security features allow you to better

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
serve your customer and unlocks

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
additional revenue especially in the b2b

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,879
space

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,239
and i think these two bullet points are

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
something that are really a priority for

80
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
every business uh your business exists

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
to serve its customers your business

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
also probably wants to make money um

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
historically security has been seen

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
but luckily customers care more about

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
security than they have ever before and

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
so you can start to change that

87
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
by getting involved in this type of work

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,080
this is also a really good opportunity

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
to transfer knowledge between these two

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
teams which is really a core concept in

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
my mind for

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
devsecops everybody needs to be learning

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
from each other

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
devsicops is not just about software

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,560
engineers fixing vulnerabilities it's

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
also about security engineers learning

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
from software engineers i'm not saying

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
that everybody needs to be a senior

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,599
full-stack engineer to be a security

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
engineer but being able to write

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
software will help you solve problems

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
and make you more relatable to your

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
partners in the engineering organization

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,799
you're going to be more confident doing

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
design reviews you'll write out better

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,480
vulnerability tickets you might be able

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,000
to even look through the code base and

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
figure out exactly where that problem is

109
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
introduced and when you write up better

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
tickets they're more likely to get fixed

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,040
because it's less work for the other

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,319
person who's supposed to be fixing them

113
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,159
this also gives you an opportunity to be

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,720
part of the business's overall success

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
two tenants of our security team is that

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,920
you should be part of the overall

117
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
business's success and that you should

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
partner really closely with engineering

119
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
the importance of being part of the

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
business's success is obvious without

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
segment there is no security team your

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
business doesn't exist to be secure it

123
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
exists to serve your customers part of

124
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
that might be delivering a secure

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
product but you should really be part of

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
the business's overall

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,840
success

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,080
um this also translates to making

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
practical security decisions for

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
employees helping sales and marketing

131
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,560
and always keeping the customer in mind

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
working closely with engineering is

133
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
important because the cumulative number

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
of choices decisions lines of code

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
written

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
bugs avoided by engineering is higher

137
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,960
than the security team working

138
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,639
collaboratively with engineering allows

139
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
us to learn from each other and help

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
everyone be a better security champion

141
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
we believe that making good software

142
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
requires making good security choices

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
and our team is here to help engineers

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
do that

145
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,560
if you haven't written any code before

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
that's okay i'm not going to talk about

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
how to get started coding in this

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
presentation there's people that are

149
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
significantly more qualified than i am

150
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
to get you going in that area but

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
assuming you've got some basic

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
development skills a great place to

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
start is fixing some small bugs

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,600
for context before segment i had written

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
a decent amount of code but i had never

156
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
written anything i was custom facing

157
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,759
uh if the tools i wrote for work broke i

158
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,280
could typically fix them on my own

159
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,679
schedule

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,919
if you're looking for a place to get

161
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,880
started take a look at your

162
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
vulnerability backlog

163
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
try to find a couple lower priority

164
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
issues that seem like they would be easy

165
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,560
to fix and if you're not sure which are

166
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
going to be easy to fix

167
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
pick a couple try to do your research

168
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,320
and then engage with somebody at your

169
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
company who's a lot more experienced

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
than you are

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
uh if you're having a struggle finding

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,680
somebody to help you out um learn about

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
your team learn about other teams by

174
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
reading through

175
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
their documentation attend some

176
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
engineering onboarding sessions go to

177
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
all

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,960
if

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,000
that's a great way to meet people too

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
donut will just randomly pair you with

181
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
people in a similar channel

182
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
and this is a good way to meet people

183
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360
that aren't on your immediate team

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
as a security engineer you also might be

185
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
doing some things like threat modeling

186
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
sessions engineering training design

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,720
reviews all of these are a way to meet

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
people if you've been a security

189
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
engineer at your company for a while and

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
you don't have friends in engineering

191
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,199
you might want to rethink your approach

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,800
to some of your existing interactions

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,759
so you found a bug you decided this is

194
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,120
the one you're going to fix

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
uh spend some time researching it the

196
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,400
goal shouldn't just be to fix this as

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
quickly as possible and be like okay i

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
fix one thing i'm an expert take some

199
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
time to figure out where is this thing

200
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
used how well does it visit

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
that's a really important one because if

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
you make a mistake

203
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
and the component is really well tested

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
the test will probably catch your

205
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
mistake but if this is something that

206
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
just doesn't have any tests and you kind

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,080
of don't know what you're doing uh

208
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,319
you're a lot more likely to break things

209
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,400
um once you have a good understanding of

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,599
how this works

211
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
uh you know go back to the person who

212
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,360
said hey this is a kind of an easy thing

213
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
to fix and

214
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,199
confirm your understanding

215
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
this will help you avoid breaking things

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,840
uh if you do break things that's okay uh

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
i once made a mistake deploying code to

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
two services which made customers not be

219
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,759
able to log in for 20 minutes with new

220
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
sessions so it happens uh everyone's

221
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
gonna hear something eventually the

222
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
important thing is to learn from it help

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
your team learn from it and then use

224
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,039
this as an opportunity to improve your

225
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,960
processes documentation and tooling

226
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
fixing small bugs is a great way to

227
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
learn how your organization ships tests

228
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,440
and deploy software

229
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,280
all of these things are kind of the same

230
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
regardless of how big the change is

231
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,319
you're still going to go through the

232
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,080
same deployment process you're still

233
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
going to have to go through the same

234
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
testing process

235
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,360
obviously the scale increases but it's a

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
good way to learn how your org does this

237
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
thing does these things

238
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
and you'll quickly learn that that

239
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
removing a vulnerability from your code

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,759
base is much more than just fixing the

241
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,520
code you need to spend time

242
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,039
understanding the various places the

243
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,879
code is used testing it writing new

244
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
tests responding to pr comments getting

245
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,479
approvals and then actually deploying

246
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
the software

247
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,200
um

248
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
this will really help you build empathy

249
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,320
with developers you probably thought

250
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
like oh that just seems like such a

251
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,760
quick fix like why doesn't somebody fix

252
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,479
that

253
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,599
uh after you fix a couple

254
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
vulnerabilities you'll realize that it's

255
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
never just a quick fix it's always more

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,240
time than you think and you probably uh

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
will have a little bit more empathy when

258
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,240
you're talking to developers next time

259
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
they say they haven't had time to fix

260
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,720
something

261
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,880
even at an organization like segment

262
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
where unit tests and i guess just all

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,959
tests pass within a couple of minutes

264
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
and the deploy is automatic it still

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
takes time to do all the other stuff

266
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,120
for example most of our repos ci can

267
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
pass and deploy within like probably six

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,080
to eight minutes and it still takes a

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
long time just to like

270
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
uh you know make sure that you're

271
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,279
confident in your changes

272
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,800
this is going to make you more relatable

273
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
to engineers the next time you're

274
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
talking with them about vulnerability

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,839
you're going to know a lot more about

276
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,920
what they go through and

277
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
what it takes to actually fix something

278
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
here are some qr tips if you haven't

279
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
written a lot of pull requests before

280
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,040
think of your pull request as a

281
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,640
historical document

282
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
future engineers including yourself are

283
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,279
going to look look back at this

284
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
looking at the codes one thing looking

285
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,360
at the git blame is one thing but

286
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,880
going back and actually looking at the

287
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
pr's context to figure out why the code

288
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
you're looking at is actually super

289
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,399
underrated and something i think a lot

290
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,040
of people don't necessarily think to do

291
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,519
um keep your pr short this might mean

292
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,200
that you have to do multiple pr's to

293
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,279
accomplish what you're trying to do

294
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
but you should be optimizing the pr for

295
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
the reviewer not for yourself

296
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
uh if a pr is easy to review it's more

297
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
likely that somebody's going to catch a

298
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
mistake

299
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
it's more likely that they are going to

300
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
give you some insightful feedback if a

301
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,040
pr just becomes overwhelmingly long

302
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
it's a lot harder to find people that

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
want to take the time to review it and

304
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,160
it's also going to make it worse if you

305
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
need to revert something and it's going

306
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
to make it more likely for you to run

307
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
into merge conflicts

308
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
if you have a brief summary and a

309
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
thorough description make sure that

310
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,079
you're including the why the why is

311
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
really important if there's jira tickets

312
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
or other pr's try to have all the

313
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
information that somebody could need and

314
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,800
pretend that they're looking at it three

315
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
months in the future because they

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
actually might be um

317
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
spend a lot of time writing good tests

318
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
writing good tests is a really good way

319
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,079
to show engineers that you know what

320
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,279
you're doing and that you've thought of

321
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
corner cases

322
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
detail your manual testing process

323
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,920
it's great to have tests that are

324
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,600
automatic but it's also good to show

325
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,279
them like hey here are all the different

326
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,959
flows that i tried in the app to try to

327
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
break this this is why i'm confident

328
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,279
that this software is going to work

329
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,279
and if you have screenshots or gifs that

330
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,560
makes your

331
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
pr even easier to understand people can

332
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
see the delta between what you're trying

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,959
to do and what what was there previously

334
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,720
and then before you merge make sure you

335
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
know how to revert it's much better to

336
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
figure out how to revert something

337
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,120
before you need to do it than when you

338
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
actually need to do it and you're

339
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
freaking out because you just broke

340
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
something in production

341
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,200
um so yeah fixing small bugs this is a

342
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
great way to make friends in engineering

343
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
generally people are happy to have you

344
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
helping them fix stuff that was on their

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
backlog

346
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
this is an opportunity for you to teach

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
them about security uh and then to teach

348
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
you about something about software

349
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,880
engineering if you learn something

350
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,519
this person is helping you you can help

351
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
them by having somebody on your team ask

352
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,320
them the same question

353
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,279
so

354
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,200
your next quest is to contribute to a

355
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
new feature and you might be thinking

356
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
you know why does this matter why should

357
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
we be writing these features

358
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
um for better or worse customer

359
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
sentiment about your

360
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,720
product security is largely shaped by

361
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,639
breaches and the security features that

362
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,639
they interact with

363
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,560
at the end of the day this is probably a

364
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
reasonable process since it's unlikely a

365
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,880
company that has an under-responded

366
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
security part it's going to invest a ton

367
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
of money into all security features

368
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
uh some folks on your vendor secure on

369
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,880
your customers vendor security teams

370
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
might review compliance certifications

371
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
but unfortunately a lot of the other

372
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,160
hard work that goes into a security

373
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,000
program isn't going to get appreciated

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
by customers other than the fact that it

375
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,800
helps prevent security breaches which is

376
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,480
huge but it's not something that

377
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
customers are actively thinking about

378
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
usually customers aren't thinking like

379
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
wow i'm so glad this vendor didn't get

380
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
reached today

381
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
luckily security teams uh or luckily for

382
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
security team security is becoming a

383
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
bigger part of the vendor review process

384
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
every year which means that it should be

385
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,760
easier to get your team funded to work

386
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
on uh cool stuff

387
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
here are some highlights from some of

388
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
the stuff we've built at segment

389
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
partnership with engineering

390
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
we built a password strength meter

391
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,600
that's powered by the dropbox zxc vbn

392
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
password library and troy hunts have i

393
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,959
been pwned api

394
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,519
these allow you to align with nist's

395
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,920
password guidance because it

396
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,279
allows you to do

397
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
realistic password strength checks and

398
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,880
then also checks for passwords that have

399
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
been part of other breaches

400
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,600
um

401
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
we also built mfa this was actually one

402
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
of our future sorry this is one of our

403
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:42,720
early

404
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,839
uh

405
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,920
security engineering partners security

406
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,839
and engineering partnerships and we

407
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
learned a lot about the process

408
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,399
uh i was no way in no way excluded from

409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
the team i was partnering with i just

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
don't think i made enough of an effort

411
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
to actually make myself a part of that

412
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,160
team and so this project felt a lot more

413
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,920
like a relay race where i did the back

414
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,360
end and then somebody else did the front

415
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
end and we kind of just made it all work

416
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
and ultimately is a very successful

417
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
project in terms of the deliverable but

418
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
we learned a lot about how to make these

419
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,680
partnerships better in the future which

420
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
i'll get into in a little bit

421
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,279
we also

422
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,959
have rebuilt our authentication and

423
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
authorization services

424
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
as well as built scim

425
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,040
skim is really cool

426
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,600
skim allows your identity provider like

427
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
azure active directory or onelogin or

428
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
octa to provision nd provision users map

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
groups

430
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,880
if you're

431
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
if you have a b2b app

432
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
and you don't offer skim you should

433
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,639
really look into this i think the job of

434
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,320
it and enterprise security folks would

435
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,880
be a lot easier if everything supported

436
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
skim

437
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
if you're not sold on writing a whole

438
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,680
feature what about a secure library

439
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
are there any vulnerability types that

440
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
keep popping up in your pen test or bug

441
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,360
bounty program a great way to eradicate

442
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
those is to make changes to the the

443
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
tools that your engineering team are

444
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,360
already using and make things easier and

445
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
more secure

446
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,880
if this is the category that you find

447
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
yourself in i still think most of this

448
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
presentation will apply to you even

449
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
though its focus is actually on security

450
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,040
features

451
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
a quick example from segment is we had

452
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
gotten a couple bug bounty reports about

453
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
user-supplied javascript hrefs there's a

454
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,680
couple places in our app where

455
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
it does make sense to allow users to

456
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,519
create links and we didn't want to deal

457
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,680
with this anymore and so

458
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
we partnered with our engineering team

459
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,399
to

460
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,639
create an allow list of url schemes so

461
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,759
automatically to links and this is

462
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
something that every link automatically

463
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,720
gets if you're using ui box this is open

464
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,079
source if you want to go take a look at

465
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
what we did

466
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,199
totally cool

467
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,279
of course there's a way to ignore this

468
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
if there is for some reason you you want

469
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,880
to be unsafe

470
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
there's a way to override it but the

471
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
default is we make a good choice for you

472
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
and uh almost nobody uh

473
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
i mean i don't know how other companies

474
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,959
are using this but i can't imagine

475
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,880
there's very many that are overriding

476
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
nervous um couple things to keep in mind

477
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,440
you actually have a lot of value even if

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,279
you haven't written any of these types

479
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,480
of features before because you've

480
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
probably used them as the person who

481
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,040
turns on 2fa in every app and you have

482
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,880
some good ideas in your head about what

483
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
is really well written and what's really

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,800
annoying to use and so you can be that

485
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
initial

486
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,360
initial customer research for your uh

487
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,519
product and engineering teams they're

488
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,199
going to learn a lot about what you

489
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,040
think about as a consumer of these types

490
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
of features and you're going to be able

491
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,360
to influence the design

492
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
how many times have you set up 2fa

493
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,279
probably a lot more than the average

494
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
product person

495
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,519
so okay so you're sold

496
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,720
you know you're not nervous anymore

497
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,920
you're ready to start writing some

498
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,359
features but you think your boss might

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
be a hold out

500
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,199
here's a couple tips to convince your

501
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,280
boss that this is a good idea

502
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,480
you're going to be getting hands-on

503
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
experience working in the code base

504
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,599
you're supposed to be protecting if

505
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,919
you're an apsec person and you are

506
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,119
actually

507
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,039
you know capable of fixing things and

508
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,400
and you know maybe even building some

509
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
small things it's going to make it a lot

510
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
easier for you to

511
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
find issues and

512
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,080
help engineers avoid issues in the

513
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,440
future

514
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,960
it's also going to make you better at

515
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,799
writing tickets as well as improve the

516
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,360
security for your customers and unlock

517
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,880
revenue from security conscious

518
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
customers these are all things that

519
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
should be important to a security team

520
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
it's also a good way to make friends uh

521
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
if you partner with the engineer

522
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,120
on the security team

523
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
um the next time they have a question

524
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
they're not gonna be like oh like i

525
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
don't know who to ask i'm just you know

526
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,679
not gonna do this uh they'll just shoot

527
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
you a slack message and uh you know even

528
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
if you're not the right person to answer

529
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,919
it

530
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,200
they feel like they have a friend on the

531
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
security org

532
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
all right so let's talk about how to

533
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
make your project successful

534
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,919
as you might expect it actually starts

535
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,440
in the planning phase way before you've

536
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
written any code

537
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
the easiest way in my experience is to

538
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,400
build something that customers have

539
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,039
asked for so go through those vendor

540
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,400
security questionnaires that you love

541
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
filling out and figure out what

542
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
customers are asking about or you know

543
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
if your product team has a good way to

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
track customer requests

545
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,360
that's another great place to look for

546
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
it and then if possible you should

547
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
always jump on the moving train and what

548
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
i mean by that is have an awareness of

549
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,840
what your company is building and if

550
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
there's something in an area that

551
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
they're already working on try to sneak

552
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,799
some security features into that

553
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,840
existing work it's a lot easier to get a

554
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
team to build like one small extra thing

555
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,640
that they're already working on than

556
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
going to a surface that nobody is

557
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,240
committed to in nine months or

558
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,679
two years or whatever and being like hey

559
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
i want to make a bunch of changes and

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
everybody who's written that service

561
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,120
doesn't work at your company anymore

562
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,960
once you find a team that's willing to

563
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
partner with you get them to commit to a

564
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,160
shared goal

565
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
um if your company does okrs this could

566
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,640
be an okr if your company does something

567
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
else it's something else

568
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,080
but for this first feature you should

569
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
really optimize for a win even if it

570
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
isn't the most important feature to

571
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,679
build at that time

572
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
if work is already happening

573
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
once both teams are committed to this

574
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
goal

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,360
agree on long-term ownership if it's you

576
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,520
working with a couple of engineers on

577
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
something that they already own it

578
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,039
probably makes sense for them to own

579
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,520
this long term

580
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,679
having one security person supporting a

581
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,679
feature isn't sustainable you know you

582
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,760
want to be able to take vacations you

583
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
have other things going on that doesn't

584
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
mean like abandon them like hang out in

585
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,240
the slack channels help them if stuff

586
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,520
comes up be willing to contribute but

587
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,120
figure out what is a sustainable model

588
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
for ownership before you go down the

589
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,840
building

590
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,679
route um when you're trying to get your

591
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,080
proposal funded start with existing data

592
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
or start tracking data to show the value

593
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,440
of this work

594
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
maybe you're proposing building single

595
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
sign-on look through those security

596
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,480
questionnaires and figure out what the

597
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
total contract value is maybe only five

598
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,720
customers have asked for single sign-on

599
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,400
but they represent five million dollars

600
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,679
of business

601
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,799
generally

602
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
your engineering org

603
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,159
is very happy to build things for

604
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,600
customers that are paying you millions

605
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
of dollars

606
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,679
maybe you're working on 2fa

607
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,200
work with product to figure out what are

608
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,280
some reasonable success metrics what

609
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,960
percentage of users do you expect to

610
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440
activate in the first month or year

611
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,039
talk to friends at other companies i

612
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,720
think the security industry can be kind

613
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
of guarded but generally if you can

614
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
talk to your peers at another company i

615
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
found people to actually be super open

616
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,919
about uh you know their stats and like

617
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:56,960
what their

618
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,039
current numbers are for things so

619
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,960
um i would say just reach out to people

620
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,159
and see if they'll share some

621
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,840
information

622
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
security metrics i think can be pretty

623
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,960
hard i think it's something that a lot

624
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,200
of security teams struggle with but

625
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,960
luckily they're a little bit easier in

626
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
product land and your company is

627
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,039
probably already reasonably good at

628
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,320
coming up with product metrics

629
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,520
if you're somebody who's into metrics

630
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
i can recommend a talk tomorrow a couple

631
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,679
of my co-workers are are giving a

632
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,440
presentation so if you want to learn

633
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760
more about infosec metrics that your

634
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
boss will love

635
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
check out their talk

636
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
when you're creating metrics or even

637
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
just writing software sql is super

638
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
underrated

639
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
sql is kind of weird because a lot of

640
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,240
times i struggle to do something that i

641
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
know how to do very easily in typescript

642
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
but uh it's

643
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,760
really really valuable to writing

644
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
efficient software and it also helps

645
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
making

646
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
supporting arguments a lot easier

647
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
if your company has a bi tool like or

648
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,640
business intelligence tool like looker

649
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
or mode or snow site

650
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
get access to it and start playing

651
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
around with it

652
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
if your company has an analytics team

653
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
that's even better they can probably run

654
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,200
circles around you in sql and they have

655
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,640
a lot of knowledge and they are

656
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,120
generally very happy to help you figure

657
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,640
out how to harness the data that they've

658
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,200
spent time cultivating

659
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,880
being able to quickly query for things

660
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
like percentage of workspaces with

661
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,679
forced mfa is super valuable

662
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,360
you can also use these tools to create

663
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
time series data and this type of thing

664
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,360
is great for end of quarter grades blogs

665
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,919
and conference presentations

666
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,000
you might be wondering what happened

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,520
here why is there this huge spike

668
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,200
i know i didn't include the y-axis

669
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,240
numbers but

670
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
this hasn't been like skewed in any way

671
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,679
but um

672
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,880
uh

673
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,720
this was the result of

674
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
a project by our intern

675
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,880
uh our intern for summer built a modal

676
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,559
that periodically would just nudge

677
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,039
workspace owners and say hey do you want

678
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,240
to turn on forced mfa for your workspace

679
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
and over the course of about a month we

680
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
had a skyrocketing number of active

681
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,799
workspaces with forced mfa so this is

682
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
really the power of building

683
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
these types of features is it can really

684
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,600
help you get good activation for stuff

685
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
that might already exist we had mfa in

686
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
our our platform for a few years um and

687
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,400
we've had a huge increase in users

688
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,280
as a result of this

689
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,880
so once you've

690
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
you know built your feature

691
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,799
revisit your original proposal were the

692
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
original metrics you established useful

693
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
maybe not that doesn't mean you should

694
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,799
keep doubling down on these bad metrics

695
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
choices but it does mean you should try

696
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
to figure out like what makes a good

697
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,360
metric for next time

698
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
how many customers are using this what's

699
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,960
the cumulative value of those customers

700
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
these types of things make it easy for

701
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,120
people outside of security or even

702
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,440
outside of engineering to understand why

703
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
we're devoting engineering and security

704
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,679
resources to building these things

705
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,679
if customers ask for this do you have a

706
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,840
way to notify those customers are go to

707
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,279
market teams aware of what you just

708
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,200
built maybe they've been dancing around

709
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
the fact that you don't have sso for two

710
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
years and if you build it and you don't

711
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,159
tell them they're going to keep dancing

712
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,400
around a question that is now actually

713
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,760
going to make it easier for them to sell

714
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,000
so

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
writing software design docs

716
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
the number one rule is follow whatever

717
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,799
company process is already in place

718
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
uh if you're on the security team do not

719
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,400
try to reinvent

720
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
your engineering design doc process

721
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,240
unless you're somebody who's written a

722
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,120
ton of

723
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
software in the past i guess

724
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,360
i'm going to go through an example for

725
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
us building scim

726
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,279
just to kind of give you a feel of you

727
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,799
know what you might want to include in a

728
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,320
design dock

729
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
but you know feel free to adapt this as

730
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
you need and just as a quick refresher

731
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
scim is awesome it allows an identity

732
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
provider to create users remove those

733
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
users

734
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,559
create groups add people remove people

735
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,400
from those groups and the reason why

736
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
this is so powerful is because when you

737
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
join a company

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,520
think back to like all the different

739
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,360
things that you had to request if a

740
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,080
company is using scim they just put you

741
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
in a group you get the same permissions

742
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
as everyone else in that group and you

743
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
automatically get provisioned in all

744
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,039
these sas apps and then in a few years

745
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,480
when you leave

746
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
you automatically get removed

747
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,760
so

748
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,000
the first part of our design dock is the

749
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,520
required reviewers

750
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,039
you need to pick people that are

751
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,400
familiar with what you're trying to

752
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,520
build

753
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
so that you get good feedback these

754
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
people are going to make your proposal a

755
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,640
lot stronger because they're going to

756
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
poke holes in the parts that don't make

757
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
sense

758
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,559
and they're going to offer improvements

759
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,320
based off of their their knowledge of

760
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,720
these systems

761
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,559
include reference docs if you're

762
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,919
building something that's based off of

763
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,440
an rfc like skim include those rfcs

764
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,279
i used to think my boss was a huge nerd

765
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,360
for talking about how he read the like

766
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,720
oauth rfc and how useful it was um

767
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,159
because that just sounded super boring

768
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,400
to me but i guess i'm the nerd now

769
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
because i read the rfcs for skim and it

770
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
was actually super helpful

771
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,679
the people that write these things are

772
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
probably smarter than you or they're

773
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
definitely smarter than me because they

774
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
come up with a lot of corner cases and

775
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
things that

776
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,799
i would have had to figure out through

777
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,000
trial and error

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
um and it was like oh i can just follow

779
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,080
what they tell you to do and it pretty

780
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,679
much works

781
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,559
if you're building something that has uh

782
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,600
like

783
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,679
vendor documentation that's helpful

784
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,279
other references that you found useful

785
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,960
maybe you found some random blog on

786
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
medium or sub stack that does a really

787
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
good job explaining this put that in

788
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,960
there and tell your co-workers like hey

789
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,480
read this if you don't know anything

790
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,000
about this thing

791
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
if there's any internal docs uh

792
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,919
reference those as well in the case of

793
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,880
skim we're heavy heavily reliant on an

794
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,360
existing api that allowed for user

795
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
management and group management and i

796
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
wanted to tell people like hey like

797
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,799
we're using this stuff that is already

798
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,039
partially built

799
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
have a glossary nobody wants to read

800
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,960
your document and be lost

801
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,799
there's a lot of different pieces of

802
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,400
jargon that you know after you've read

803
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
the rfc you just you know see idp and

804
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,799
you know that's identity provider not

805
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,919
everyone is going to feel that same way

806
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,760
um now that you've gotten kind of all

807
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,080
the background information uh you know

808
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,440
references and that kind of thing out of

809
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,559
the way

810
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,559
you need a section that's talking about

811
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
like the current state of the world what

812
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,159
what are you building why do you need to

813
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,640
build it why is now the time to build it

814
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
and this should include a lot of the

815
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,520
stats that you collected during your

816
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,440
research phase don't let those go to

817
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
waste not everyone was you know kind of

818
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
part of the decision to actually build

819
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,360
this now you're actually asking for help

820
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,919
to decide how to build it so bring some

821
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,840
of these stats back

822
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,440
this can also be a little bit of a sales

823
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,399
pitch

824
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,760
i mean i think anything can be a little

825
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,600
bit of a sales pitch but this is a good

826
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,919
way to get people uh bought into why

827
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
you're building this thing

828
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,799
next create your requirements um

829
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,960
having stuff prioritized shows people

830
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,720
that you know you kind of put on your

831
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,159
product hat and you're trying to figure

832
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,440
out like what

833
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,559
things are are absolutely necessary

834
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,399
for us you know adding and removing

835
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,880
users was incredibly important

836
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
another really important piece was

837
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
making it easy for our customers to use

838
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
and sign up the last thing i want to do

839
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
is build something and then just get

840
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,640
bombarded with customer tickets asking

841
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,919
for me to show them how to use octa

842
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,200
so we went through the onboarding

843
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
process with octa one login and azure

844
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,799
and now customers can just click a few

845
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
buttons and they can get up and running

846
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
with skim

847
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
our second set of priorities were around

848
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
groups

849
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,840
just because something is in your

850
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
prioritization lower it doesn't mean

851
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,880
that

852
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
that has to be the order you build it in

853
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,200
the case of skim it made way more sense

854
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,720
for us to build the whole system and

855
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,880
then on board with octa rather than

856
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
build our priority one features on board

857
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
with octa build the priority two

858
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
features go through the onboarding

859
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
process again

860
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,039
it would have added additional weeks to

861
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,520
our our timelines uh it made way more

862
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,799
sense just to build it and then go to

863
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,039
often be like hey we did everything

864
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,360
um

865
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,399
this is not water flow or waterfall

866
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,840
software development just because you're

867
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,679
spending a lot of time planning doesn't

868
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
mean that it is inflexible

869
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,039
your plans can totally change

870
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
software development's hard you need to

871
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,399
be adaptable

872
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,919
but the goal here is to have something

873
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,080
that's roughly going to translate into

874
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
something that can

875
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
track your work as you're moving forward

876
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
whether this is jira or github issues or

877
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,559
whatever

878
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,840
your work breakdown structure is

879
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,279
something that should be like roughly

880
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,480
translated to groups of tickets

881
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
throw in some pictures people love

882
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
pictures uh learn how to use lucidchart

883
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,880
or whatever your your company uses to

884
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,000
draw stuff

885
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,480
um this is a great way for visual

886
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,320
learners to understand what you're doing

887
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,000
in our case it was like hey all these

888
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,799
user management endpoints already exist

889
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,679
for non-skim use we want to use

890
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
them for skim we're kind of just reusing

891
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,159
them and then reformatting the requests

892
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,520
to

893
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,399
work with the protocol

894
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,399
these types of diagrams are also really

895
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,399
helpful for people that

896
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
want to understand what you're doing um

897
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
these docs add a lot of credit or these

898
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
types of drawings add a lot of

899
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,120
credibility to your docs

900
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,720
you can also talk about the technical

901
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,799
details of the implementation try to be

902
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,760
pretty detailed here um if somebody can

903
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
pick something out that doesn't seem

904
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,840
right it can save you days or weeks

905
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,720
later

906
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,480
um if they're able to be like hey this

907
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
isn't uh you know this doesn't make

908
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,960
sense or this won't work um

909
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,480
if you have any risks uh

910
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,000
let people know like what you've

911
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
identified for this project and how you

912
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
plan on mitigating them this also adds a

913
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,760
lot of credibility because people are

914
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
gonna see like oh this person seems to

915
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
have thought about all these things

916
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
they've tried to come up with ways to

917
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,480
avoid them

918
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,919
i think this person knows what they're

919
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:56,720
doing

920
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,960
and hopefully you do

921
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
it's also totally fine that call stuff

922
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,919
is out of scope you're not going to

923
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,679
necessarily have the ability to build

924
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,080
everything all at once it's fine to say

925
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,399
hey we know this is important but

926
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,760
we don't have time for this right now

927
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,840
when you get to the security review

928
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,279
which you probably will because you're

929
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,799
building something that's relatively

930
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
high risk because it has a lot of

931
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
security impact

932
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,240
just because you're on the security team

933
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,840
doesn't mean that this feature is now

934
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
somehow exempt from review

935
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
go through the security review from the

936
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,240
pros or from the standpoint of a

937
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,919
developer have somebody else be the

938
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,080
security engineer in the room uh you

939
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,159
know feel free to argue with them over

940
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,279
things but

941
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,880
really at the end of the day like you

942
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
are

943
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,440
wearing a software engineering hat right

944
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,799
now you're not a security engineer

945
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,880
if this feels a little bit overwhelming

946
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
uh remember that the feedback makes your

947
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,360
design better and avoids problems in the

948
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,240
future

949
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,679
anything that you can

950
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,519
avoid during the planning phase that's

951
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,039
the perfect time to avoid it you might

952
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
have spent a couple hours writing up a

953
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,640
paragraph but that's way better than

954
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,919
having somebody

955
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
uh you know tell you in the prs that

956
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,159
this is not gonna work

957
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,840
um if your company has a standard

958
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,240
template 100 use that and then get

959
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
feedback from people that

960
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,720
have written design docs before

961
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,799
um i didn't go over this in the the

962
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
scien proposal but if you have multiple

963
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
options that you're considering feel

964
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,559
free to write up multiple options and

965
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
get feedback on like what people think

966
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,200
is the best choice if you have ideas of

967
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,480
pros and cons

968
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,960
uh definitely include those too

969
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,480
and then the last thing

970
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,320
um you know you should work somewhere

971
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,600
where your peers want you to be

972
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,279
successful regardless of what team

973
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,480
they're on

974
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,840
we should all be trying to deliver

975
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
something that's great for our customers

976
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,760
and if your co-workers don't want you to

977
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
succeed

978
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
it is definitely an employee's market

979
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,039
right now look for another job

980
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,120
um

981
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,000
so

982
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,720
you've decided you know okay i've got my

983
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,200
idea funded i've got the planning docs

984
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,440
people think the idea is you know good

985
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,480
they think the work breakdown

986
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,120
structure's good uh let's actually

987
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
join this other team temporarily and

988
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,000
build this thing

989
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
um so a couple of things that you can do

990
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,720
to make this successful is try to act

991
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,320
like you're just somebody who got hired

992
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,279
at your company on to this new team

993
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,200
have we have one-on-ones with the team's

994
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
manager attend their weekly meetings if

995
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,679
they do stand up every day or if they do

996
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,840
demos or whatever like you are on this

997
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,039
team

998
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,760
follow the team's adopted process

999
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
for jira tickets planning etc

1000
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,559
there are some things that i've learned

1001
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
from other teams at segment that are now

1002
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,360
part of things that i do for my team and

1003
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,960
i wouldn't have known to do them without

1004
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,559
joining these other teams and just

1005
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,480
stealing their good ideas and and

1006
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,960
bringing them back to my team

1007
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,559
this isn't just

1008
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
about you delivering new features this

1009
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,600
is about you learning from people that

1010
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,279
are really talented in ways that are

1011
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,960
different from you at your organization

1012
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,600
also join their slack channels uh you

1013
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,440
know trade security and non-security

1014
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
tasks with another developer you know

1015
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
maybe have them build part of the

1016
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,559
security stuff and then you work on like

1017
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,000
the logging and the metrics and the

1018
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,399
dashboards or whatever the idea is to

1019
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,639
get like a really good exposure to all

1020
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,159
the things that

1021
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,320
are part of delivering software

1022
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,520
um

1023
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,119
throughout this you'll pick up new

1024
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,719
skills from product and engineering

1025
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,800
managers about how they run products

1026
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,879
projects as well as gain a general

1027
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,800
appreciate appreciation for how things

1028
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,480
are built at your company these are a

1029
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,320
good way to level up even if you want to

1030
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
be an individual contributor for your

1031
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,879
whole career knowing how people

1032
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,639
plan and deliver projects is going to

1033
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
make it easier to get promoted because

1034
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,760
you're going to be more autonomous when

1035
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
you're working on bigger things

1036
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,399
and then if you're if the team event

1037
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,480
that invites you to attend events like a

1038
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,520
cooking class or go-kart racing

1039
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,760
try to go this is a good way to to me

1040
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,599
meet people

1041
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
i still got invited to events after

1042
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,359
showing up and beating everybody at

1043
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,160
go-kart so i definitely recommend doing

1044
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,119
fun stuff with your company

1045
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,880
i'm not gonna go into

1046
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,599
uh the process of like actually building

1047
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
scim

1048
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
um i think it would probably end up

1049
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
feeling a little bit like hey

1050
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,560
here's all this in-depth planning stuff

1051
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,359
and then just like build it um it's

1052
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,880
going to be pretty specific to your

1053
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,200
company how things get built but just to

1054
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,359
go over some things that i think are

1055
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,359
generally applicable uh to most

1056
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,720
companies

1057
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
keep your plan up to date those planning

1058
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,680
docs that you created go back and make

1059
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,040
changes as

1060
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
uh the project advances

1061
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,200
these are things that managers go back

1062
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
and look at it's also something that

1063
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,320
people will probably send to each other

1064
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
as kind of informal documentation when

1065
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,720
they want to know how something's built

1066
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,079
and so it's good to keep these up to

1067
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,880
date

1068
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,480
if something changes you know you think

1069
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,079
part two of the plan was going to take

1070
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,480
two weeks and then takes four go back

1071
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
and try to re-estimate the project

1072
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
estimating how long things are going to

1073
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,160
take is important whether you're a

1074
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
security engineer whether you're a

1075
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,680
software engineer you know

1076
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,760
kind of any role at the company being

1077
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,599
able to tell your boss accurately how

1078
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,960
long you think something is going to

1079
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,200
take is really important and there is no

1080
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,880
shortcut to getting good at estimating

1081
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
its stuff like you just have to estimate

1082
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,079
stuff and be wrong a bunch of times and

1083
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,640
like hopefully you get a little bit

1084
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,359
better as you go

1085
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,200
read up on your company's practices for

1086
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,440
logging metrics testing

1087
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,200
etc these are components of good

1088
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,280
software just like security we don't

1089
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
want software engineers to introduce a

1090
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,119
bunch of vulnerabilities software

1091
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
engineers don't want us to skimp out on

1092
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
logging and all this stuff and then when

1093
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
something breaks it's just a nightmare

1094
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,000
to figure out like

1095
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,839
is this broken you know how did it break

1096
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,839
how long has it been broken

1097
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,839
you want to build good software because

1098
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,079
you want your company to succeed

1099
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,400
um

1100
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
revisit the pull request tips i'm not

1101
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,599
going to go through that again but um

1102
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,560
yeah

1103
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
those are are really helpful

1104
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:57,920
um

1105
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
additionally you want to spend time

1106
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
writing really good tests and

1107
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,079
documentation

1108
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,240
uh docs are really really handy if

1109
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,760
you're the person who's the expert on

1110
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
something because the next time somebody

1111
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
asks you a question you can just link

1112
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,960
them to the docs instead of uh you know

1113
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,079
trying to remember and then like

1114
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,480
repeating yourself people also share

1115
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,079
docs so if the support team or the

1116
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
customer success team is like hey how's

1117
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
this work and you can just point them to

1118
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,440
docs they're gonna tell their friends on

1119
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,000
the team like hey these docs exist and

1120
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
then you won't get asked stuff in the

1121
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,119
future

1122
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
focus on building stuff incrementally

1123
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,280
you should have a working product at

1124
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,119
varying levels of maturity throughout

1125
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,880
the development this doesn't mean that

1126
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,160
this is something that's released to

1127
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,720
customers but it just means that you're

1128
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,079
you have something that's working at

1129
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,280
every stage

1130
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,560
once you get to the point where you're

1131
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,040
ready to roll something out uh your

1132
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
company probably has a way to do feature

1133
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,880
flagging you can do a staggered rollout

1134
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,280
and really monitor what's happening and

1135
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,079
figure out is whatever i just

1136
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,599
rolled out actually working the way that

1137
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,920
i want it to

1138
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
create the dashboards for monitoring as

1139
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,400
you go this will help test your

1140
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
notification infrastructure the worst

1141
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
thing you can do is create a really nice

1142
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,480
dashboard and then forget to hook it up

1143
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,200
to slack and so you have all this stuff

1144
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,040
that is actually trying to tell you that

1145
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
something is wrong but you're not

1146
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
getting the message

1147
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,400
after you've built the feature

1148
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
um you know you've shipped it

1149
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
everything's great uh spend some time

1150
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,320
reflecting on what could be improved for

1151
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,400
next time not just from like the feature

1152
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,920
standpoint but also just the whole

1153
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
process of the embed

1154
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,079
a team has probably spent days or weeks

1155
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,520
or months working with you on this

1156
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,960
project

1157
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,400
help them out by spreading this

1158
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
knowledge to other people on your team

1159
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
can you convert what they've taught you

1160
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
into a mini training can you improve the

1161
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,240
documentations for that for that team

1162
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
how can you show them like hey i

1163
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
actually really

1164
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,920
uh respect your time and i've grown a

1165
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,560
lot i want to give back to you

1166
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,160
try to hang out in some of the slack

1167
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,680
channels um

1168
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,720
we have

1169
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,520
questions channels at segment that go to

1170
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,200
market teams will pop into and be like

1171
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,720
hey this you know

1172
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,119
how does this sso thing work or like

1173
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,280
mfa isn't working or whatever

1174
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,599
um even if you're not the person who has

1175
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,680
long term ownership of these features if

1176
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
you're qualified to answer these try to

1177
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,000
stay in and help out um because it'll

1178
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,440
show the team like hey you know they

1179
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,960
didn't just build it and then

1180
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,280
bail

1181
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,000
use this knowledge to better estimate

1182
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,560
how long fixes will take in the future

1183
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
hopefully this has really increased your

1184
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,320
empathy for developers and you can have

1185
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,240
a new appreciation for how long it takes

1186
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,079
to actually build stuff

1187
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,040
um

1188
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,440
this will also help you make paved paths

1189
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
in the future think back to the react

1190
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,480
secure library i was talking about once

1191
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,760
you have a little bit of product

1192
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,520
experience it's going to be a lot easier

1193
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,119
for you to build things like that that

1194
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,720
just make it so you never have to see

1195
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,680
another

1196
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,920
stupid javascript href vulnerability

1197
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
from bug crowd

1198
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
if this team uh you know helped you

1199
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
build something and you're talking about

1200
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,119
it all at an all hands uh include that

1201
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,800
team in the intro outro slide the last

1202
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,720
thing you want to do is be like i built

1203
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,400
this thing and it's like okay actually

1204
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,839
four people built this thing i'm just

1205
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,000
the presenter um if you're writing a

1206
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
blog throw a quick thank you at the

1207
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,680
bottom if somebody was helpful shoot a

1208
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,280
message to their manager saying like hey

1209
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,880
this person

1210
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,079
was a you know was really useful

1211
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,240
offered to write a performance review

1212
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,440
for them

1213
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
i know writing performance reviews is

1214
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
annoying it takes a really long time but

1215
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,400
it's really helpful to people's careers

1216
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,599
and if somebody helped you build

1217
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,119
something awesome

1218
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,560
you know the least you can do is take a

1219
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,760
half hour to to write them a review

1220
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
and on that note

1221
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,960
i have to say thanks to everyone on the

1222
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,720
enterprise software team at segment and

1223
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,000
anybody else that's helped me build

1224
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,079
stuff we've been able to create some

1225
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,680
really cool stuff and i definitely would

1226
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,160
not have been able to to do without

1227
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,400
without your help

1228
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
and then as we wrap up just a few

1229
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
closing thoughts um

1230
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,480
shifting left of psycho-ops whatever you

1231
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,319
want to call it is at least as much

1232
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,119
about people as it is about technology

1233
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,280
um you need to be able to work well with

1234
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,119
people at your company to be able to to

1235
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,520
build cool stuff

1236
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,920
security is a component of good software

1237
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
devs want to build good software you

1238
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
just need to be there to help them and

1239
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,200
part of that process is also you

1240
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,640
learning from them it's not just you

1241
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,560
teaching them security

1242
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,319
you need to be making yourself more

1243
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,119
relatable to them in the future um

1244
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,000
and a great way to do that is to

1245
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,319
fix some small bugs and then once you

1246
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,960
kind of get your feet wet

1247
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,839
you can make friends and start to to

1248
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,839
work on some feature development working

1249
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,839
with devs is a lot easier when everybody

1250
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,079
speaks the same language and for

1251
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,760
developers that language is generally

1252
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,000
code

1253
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,640
security features are really valuable to

1254
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,119
customers especially in the b2b space

1255
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,119
but even in the b2c space i think it's

1256
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,760
relevant if you make mfa easy to use

1257
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
more people will use it

1258
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,520
i've started using

1259
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,680
web off then the like touch id with

1260
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,000
github and it's amazing it's so fast you

1261
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,520
just you know fingerprint and you're

1262
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,640
good

1263
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,960
i know riot games used to give some

1264
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
people exclusive skins for signing up

1265
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,200
for mfa i think that you should figure

1266
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
out ways to incentivize your customers

1267
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,119
to make the right choices

1268
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,040
and then uh lastly learning how your

1269
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,640
company writes delivers and maintains

1270
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,000
software is just going to make you a

1271
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
better security engineer even if you

1272
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,680
don't see yourself as a software

1273
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,200
engineer long term

1274
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,720
if you're somebody that works closely

1275
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,400
with software engineers this is going to

1276
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,960
make you better at your job

1277
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,280
and then lastly thanks to all of you for

1278
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,400
attending

1279
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,680
this talk

1280
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
this was actually based off of a blog

1281
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,040
that i released earlier this year so if

1282
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,319
you want to

1283
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,760
you know revisit

1284
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,920
some of the concepts in blog format i

1285
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,839
prefer that i don't usually go back and

1286
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,800
re-watch a presentation that i i saw

1287
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,319
most of the stuff is in the blog and

1288
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,599
then if you do want to check out the

1289
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,800
slides

1290
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
as i mentioned there on sketch we are

1291
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,119
hiring come talk to me or

1292
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
the three people in the front left up

1293
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,920
here and follow me on twitter my dms are

1294
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,440
open if you have any questions i'm

1295
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,400
always happy to to chat with people

1296
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,940
and that's it

1297
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:16,000
[Applause]

1298
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,839
is this a like a

1299
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,359
full-time

1300
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,599
position not segment is it a protective

1301
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,240
security engineering or is it doing this

1302
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,040
in addition to

1303
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,599
so it started as in addition to the

1304
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,960
apsec job

1305
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,200
um when i started at segment the team

1306
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,960
was significantly smaller the company

1307
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,640
was a lot smaller and so i was kind of

1308
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,599
doing

1309
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,440
you know some stuff with bug crowds some

1310
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,359
stuff with snick like design reviews

1311
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,680
threat modeling but i was also really

1312
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
interested in becoming a better software

1313
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,440
developer and so

1314
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,599
i would make time at work to

1315
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,359
do all the things that i talked about in

1316
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,720
the presentation

1317
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,440
and then as our team grew

1318
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
we just decided that it made sense to

1319
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,920
split the team into two teams and so now

1320
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
we have

1321
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,599
another engineering manager that is

1322
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,960
focused on

1323
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,520
the type of stuff that i used to work on

1324
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,760
and then i'm actually leading a team of

1325
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
people that are focused on this so at

1326
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,040
this point it is split out but it was

1327
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,680
like a gradual thing that happened over

1328
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,560
the course of a couple of years

1329
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,599
um

1330
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,760
so

1331
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,560
that library is actually a component of

1332
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,400
our design system

1333
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,160
and so we have an open source design

1334
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,760
system called evergreen that you can

1335
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,599
check out the docs are really good it's

1336
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,520
it's really easy to use

1337
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,920
a developer would have to go so far out

1338
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,920
of their way to not use evergreen that

1339
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
it would just like

1340
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,520
it would never be worth it because like

1341
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
writing something in our app without

1342
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,599
using evergreen would just

1343
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,920
be like so bespoke and weird it just

1344
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,800
like would not happen

1345
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,119
all right well i'll be around if anyone

1346
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,839
wants to chat
