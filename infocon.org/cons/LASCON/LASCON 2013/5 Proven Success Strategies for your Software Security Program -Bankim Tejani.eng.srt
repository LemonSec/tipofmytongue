1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,609
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> began kind of my career as a</font>

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,100
software developer so I started

3
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:28,180
programming at the ripe young age of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:31,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked my way up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from Pascal and</font>

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fortran to c and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java and.net i worked</font>

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">for software development companies for a</font>

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
number of years doing everything from

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,420
device drivers too thick client

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,730
applications to some web apps and then

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:47,200
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way I had an opportunity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,989
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my projects was data mining</font>

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,989
software where we were writing code to

13
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:55,839
do anomaly analysis on network traffic

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:58,750
and that you know prior to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font>

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,460
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a hobby and just an interest</font>

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,579
and I was like hey this is a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,830
potential profession and that was that

18
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,710
was back in 2002 so it was quite a long

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,140
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transitioned from software</font>

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,229
development into<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec and I began red</font>

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,659
teaming pen caps training and did a lot

22
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,380
of work at the time I was at Sandia

23
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:21,880
National Laboratories but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,640
transitioned i also got my masters and

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,220
focused on information security and

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,770
information assurance and then I

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,630
transition and I went back towards

28
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,090
application security and software

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,570
security so prior to this role I spent

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,130
five years at fortify software during

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,929
the startup days and then also<font color="#E5E5E5"> post</font>

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">acquisition after we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acquired by HP</font>

33
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I spent those years all of them</font>

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,610
in services working with companies

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,380
implementing both static analysis but

36
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,930
also helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> them figure out how to be</font>

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,710
successful at software security how to

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:59,259
engage their development teams and make

39
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,579
improvements that were tangible but to

40
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,130
do it in a way that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

41
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:06,008
cost-effective either politically or

42
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:09,720
financially politically in the business

43
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:12,129
sense or meet their compliance goals

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate technologies the right</font>

45
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,390
way

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,640
so forth so in that time I'd spent a lot

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,429
of time training developers on secure

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,708
coding because you can't fix it if you

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know it will get more get into</font>

50
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,180
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that further but as well as</font>

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,220
teaching the managers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and helping them</font>

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,349
establish programs that could be

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,690
successful and sustainable on their own

54
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:36,179
so they didn't have to have consultancy

55
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">in all the time to do things they could</font>

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,829
do it sustainably or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you know</font>

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,209
take a small security team with hundreds

58
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,400
of development teams and actually get

59
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,440
that to scale and not have to have each

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,150
team come to the security team to do

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,430
things to empower those development

62
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,120
teams to do things on their own and have

63
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,359
results and then my current role I'm a

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,639
security architect at service match so

65
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:01,409
is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a change in that we</font>

66
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,870
have one development team one product

67
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,358
and I'm part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that development so</font>

68
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,879
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than being the consultant you</font>

69
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,400
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're product security is a</font>

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,510
function of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> development team and so</font>

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,769
there's lessons that I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

72
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,668
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share some of those as</font>

73
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,829
well so the goal today is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

74
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,590
you you know pick up some of these

75
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,410
attributes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take with you</font>

76
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,000
and implement with your own teams now to

77
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,889
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to do a little bit of</font>

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,510
scoping and those of you are familiar

79
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,459
with the development process scoping is

80
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,679
very important and it's as important to

81
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,120
rule out what you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as it is</font>

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are doing so I thought I would</font>

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my hand at that as well and and this</font>

84
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not to say there's anything bad about</font>

85
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've ruled out it's just not</font>

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I can cover or that the</font>

87
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,250
primary focus of today's talk so

88
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,290
compliance and and triage and Incident

89
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,900
Response are very very important for

90
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,448
programs but these are you know live

91
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,370
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exercises it's not something</font>

92
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's they're generally reactive</font>

93
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,030
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have you</font>

94
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,440
know either you failed an audit or

95
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,780
you've got a compliance activity going

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,728
you as a business you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,949
there's no choice and you have to do

98
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,470
whatever you you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

99
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,150
through that audit likewise with an

100
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,159
incident you need to do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

101
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,079
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the incident to get your</font>

102
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:21,659
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your forensics</font>

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,110
it's not necessarily a proactive

104
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:25,729
enterprise you can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in advance</font>

105
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,669
to be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the for that event</font>

106
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,960
but when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the midst of it this</font>

107
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,948
isn't none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tips are going to</font>

108
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,789
help you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in the midst of</font>

109
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:37,159
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> activities and one of the keys</font>

110
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:39,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's important to me is is not</font>

111
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:41,840
punishing development teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

112
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:45,340
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to why that's the case shortly</font>

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,989
and despite my caveat that I was at a

114
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,299
vendor before this talk is not about

115
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,340
tools that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy I may mention</font>

116
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,699
some by name but there's no endorsement

117
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,900
involved there and in truth there's no

118
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,610
tool that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy that's going to</font>

119
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,500
solve these problems this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as much</font>

120
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the process</font>

121

technology that you can you can

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement but some of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

124
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,580
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to help you achieve our</font>

proactive iterative improvement

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:19,068
strategies things in for the most part

127
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:20,210
looking back at them they're very little

help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you structure your program to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

130
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:30,259
more effective and to have demonstrated

131
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:33,099
results over time empowering the

132
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:36,830
development teams to do that and to have

133
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:39,589
repeatability and doing that and as a

134
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,258
result ending up with better software

135
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:45,469
and you may never get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a place where</font>

136
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's completely bulletproof the software</font>

137
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:49,509
applications at your building but you

138
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,800
can get them to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and better and</font>

139
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,199
like with everything else in security

140
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,180
you don't have to outrun the bear you

141
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,189
just have to outrun the guy next to you

142
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,710
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there is a trade-off end</font>

143
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:03,469
and part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is making your</font>

144
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,930
software better than your competitors or

145
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:08,449
the those others that you may be

146
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,080
competing against and finally to

147
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:15,050
whatever tools you decide to use in in

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,389
your process to do a few things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

149
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,839
can try to use them more effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

150
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:23,479
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best value out of you soon so</font>

151
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,120
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the goals please feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free to</font>

152
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask questions during there's also some</font>

153
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,229
time at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here for the</font>

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole day so you can also pay me</font>

155
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,490
afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be here all day tomorrow</font>

156
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:36,980
as well and I'm local<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Austin so if</font>

157
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,720
you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be local in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the region</font>

158
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:46,100
you know he'll feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact me</font>

159
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,200
and just chat or go to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy hour so</font>

160
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,360
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a five-course success strategies</font>

161
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about and and go</font>

162
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,610
through and I'll I also highlight some

163
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,140
case studies without naming<font color="#E5E5E5"> names of</font>

164
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:01,400
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and why and</font>

165
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,380
less successful and also why so start

166
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,599
out with developer education and and

167
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:11,810
learning a<font color="#CCCCCC"> road map integrating to your</font>

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,330
SD LCS and your team's sdlc s using

169
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,070
tools effectively and then lessons

170
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:21,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned from joining the development</font>

171
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:25,390
team<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so first up is developer</font>

172
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:28,010
education so just by a raise of hands

173
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,370
how many of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have taken computer</font>

174
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,820
science courses<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's that's</font>

175
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:38,210
more than I expected how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

176
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,590
remember let's say your first<font color="#E5E5E5"> four will</font>

177
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,219
call it first for computer science

178
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,929
courses you know project that you did

179
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,260
some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the teacher made</font>

180
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,540
you do and through those first four

181
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:55,630
courses how many of you ever heard the

182
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,630
word security discussed in those courses

183
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,429
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is a major challenge</font>

184
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,980
and as developers in those first four

185
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,470
courses you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning the core of the</font>

186
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,300
language generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're learning your</font>

187
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,160
your fundamental data structures and

188
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,190
algorithms you're running

189
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">object-oriented programming and</font>

190
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,370
depending on the nature of your

191
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">curriculum by that point you've already</font>

192
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,480
built several functional applications

193
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,950
now let's say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time later and</font>

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,960
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and you're like hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

195
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:31,520
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

196
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,289
course how would you reuse that that

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,409
design pattern that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you learned well you</font>

198
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:40,339
probably go dig up your code copy it

199
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:42,228
paste it and use it and there's nothing

200
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is this is</font>

201
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,100
how we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> things done in the world and</font>

202
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,540
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a developer or whether</font>

203
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,279
it's an accountant with the spreadsheet

204
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,480
it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

205
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,230
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reuse things that we've</font>

206
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,029
already done but the challenge is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

207
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,589
our developers haven't been taught and

208
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:03,230
integrated into their education the

209
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:06,110
ideas of security and software security

210
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,279
and even down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic design</font>

211
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:15,050
patterns that they use and so in that

212
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:16,759
sense you can't blame<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone for not</font>

213
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,628
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were never</font>

214
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,980
taught to do right so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

215
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,449
being angry at your twelve-year-old for

216
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,129
not knowing how to drive the car well

217
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,930
they haven't they haven't gone to

218
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:31,100
drivers<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID yet they haven't learned any</font>

219
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,040
of the fundamentals and this is still

220
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,189
the case so I in every every so often I

221
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,279
do a review of top curriculums in

222
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:42,170
computer science so just this week i was

223
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,329
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> four in preparation for the</font>

224
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,110
talk I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at curriculum from</font>

225
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:51,138
MIT<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carnegie Mellon UT and Stanford sure</font>

226
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,879
fairly good you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> education programs</font>

227
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,500
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a strong focus in engineering</font>

228
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,879
they've integrated kind of engineering

229
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,100
concepts into their computer science

230
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,769
courses but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font>

231
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,259
curriculums the books they use theirs

232
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,480
you know and then the courses and topics

233
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:07,970
they have they have computer network

234
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,209
security almost always as a junior

235
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,889
senior level course and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them now</font>

236
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:15,199
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mandatory few years ago was</font>

237
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:17,120
still just an option and elective so now

238
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:20,240
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a least a mandatory subject of</font>

239
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,420
that but that's all after you've learned

240
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,850
your design patents and so now going

241
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,529
back and reconnecting those this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

242
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:33,079
pretty difficult likewise<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can still</font>

243
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:36,980
pick up and I happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skim one a</font>

244
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple months ago you can pick up brand</font>

245
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,000
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current edition</font>

246
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:44,508
database programming books web

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,370
programming books and the first you know

248
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,740
half to two-thirds of these books<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

249
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,899
show you how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build functional</font>

250
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,019
applications that work with databases

251
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,059
that help you build websites and then

252
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,709
you get to the back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where you</font>

253
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things about performance and</font>

254
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:02,530
security

255
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,599
and so it's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise when you've</font>

256
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,480
got new and young developers coming out

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,810
and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the design patterns</font>

258
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,430
that we want them to be using so it's

259
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a surprise that cross-site scripting</font>

260
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:20,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and sequel injection for the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

261
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:23,830
years remain the top two issues in web

262
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,710
application security and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> neither one</font>

263
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">for both their incredibly solvable</font>

264
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,600
design patterns they're incredibly well

265
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,660
understood and<font color="#E5E5E5"> research design patterns</font>

266
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,730
they're not you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new floating</font>

267
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,459
point zero day in the JRE right which

268
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,900
which happens now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then but this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

269
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,680
not you know something that's

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,050
extraordinary rocket science but we have

271
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,930
to to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of build that back in to our</font>

272
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,079
organizations so for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you that</font>

273
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,859
have development<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams and so kind of</font>

274
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:01,530
demonstrate the bullet point how many of

275
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you invest more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a day a year in</font>

276
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,140
developer education not including

277
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,140
conferences

278
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,230
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you invest in your</font>

279
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,570
developers I mean you'd send them to get

280
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,270
training technical training not at a

281
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:24,520
conference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than a day / you</font>

282
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a handful and that's a big</font>

283
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal I mean think of any profession even</font>

284
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,820
even for us those of you that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIS</font>

285
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">SPS or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CS LPS or other certifications</font>

286
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,089
right what what's the credit hour

287
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:40,180
requirement that you're supposed to do

288
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:45,970
annually for your certification it's 30

289
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:48,069
I think something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we don't</font>

290
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,880
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> structures for developers</font>

291
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and for the most part companies treat</font>

292
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,070
developers as a commodity right rather

293
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:59,350
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending a developer to a course to</font>

294
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,620
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-performance algorithms</font>

295
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,180
they'll just hire someone who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking a</font>

296
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,100
class in<font color="#CCCCCC"> high performance algorithms or</font>

297
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,979
they'll look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know someone has on</font>

298
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,800
their resume and has done it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over but</font>

299
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't necessarily help you scale</font>

300
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,689
and build the resources that you have

301
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:22,000
available and also often training can be

302
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,380
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> checkbox and and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be okay in</font>

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,510
some circumstances if you've got a

304
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,550
compliance requirement that you must

305
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have security awareness training for all</font>

306
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:33,189
developers well by<font color="#E5E5E5"> golly you better</font>

307
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,949
check the box but that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that</font>

308
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,510
that training will necessarily teach

309
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,240
them everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to teach</font>

310
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,819
them and it so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge to</font>

311
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,339
that there's lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways to</font>

312
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">do training not all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which cost a lot</font>

313
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money some can others but there's</font>

314
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:55,149
various formats but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's also</font>

315
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,520
important to recognize is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font>

316
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,829
for those developers to retain what

317
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,880
they're learning how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

318
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:05,680
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of corporate ethics</font>

319
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,100
CVTs that large companies always have to

320
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,540
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a few chuckles right how much</font>

321
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you actually remember from those</font>

322
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:17,319
besides the bad badly acted videos that

323
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,270
come from them right very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little and and</font>

324
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,059
that's still the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say for the</font>

325
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">majority of</font>

00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:25,108

327
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,149
awareness training that are out further

328
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:28,889
edits<font color="#CCCCCC"> its check the box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training to make</font>

329
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:31,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay every employees receive this</font>

330
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:35,129
but what is the developer taken away

331
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:38,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">from it that's actionable when you get</font>

332
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:40,349
to more specific ones often and then

333
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a great set of courses that are</font>

334
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:44,969
out there from various vendors on secure

335
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:47,669
coding and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have secure coding</font>

336
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:49,379
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or secure coding for Ned and</font>

337
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">the various languages and they're</font>

338
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:54,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a big improvement over</font>

339
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:55,649
generic awareness and there are big

340
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,268
improvement over kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the attack</font>

341
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,499
centric courses or a lot of attack

342
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,869
centric courses that teach you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

343
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:03,869
break web applications not as many about

344
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:06,329
how to build secure ones so there's a

345
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:09,269
spectrum there but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even those courses</font>

346
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:12,539
teach a developer in a very generic

347
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:15,029
design pattern wet so if you're a

348
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,639
developer and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being taught about</font>

349
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:19,619
inline sequel and they teach you about

350
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,759
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to use parametrize queries</font>

351
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,759
and you know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really helpful</font>

352
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,729
except if your development stack is all

353
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,089
with hibernate you never touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

354
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:32,189
so while you've learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> something your</font>

355
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,999
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply that in your own</font>

356
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:37,228
<font color="#CCCCCC">application is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now taken away because it</font>

357
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:40,349
didn't teach you something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

358
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:42,599
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your development stack and that's</font>

359
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:45,419
that makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to retain</font>

360
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:47,339
so because you never now practice it

361
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,218
some years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago it's going to be</font>

362
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:51,359
difficult for you to retain that so one

363
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:54,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the mechanisms that's been really</font>

364
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:58,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful in my career in balancing</font>

365
00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:01,019
that is using the workshops using those

366
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:05,159
courses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the developers own</font>

367
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:08,579
application as the subject for the

368
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:10,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">course now if you're getting a vendor to</font>

369
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,118
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that can cost a little bit more</font>

370
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,039
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor probably has to scan</font>

371
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:16,289
or analyze your your source code or to

372
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">find some examples in it but it can be</font>

373
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,069
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful you can do it internally</font>

374
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:22,579
you've got a senior resource or you can

375
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:26,878
partner with you know a senior architect

376
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:29,279
to do that that's that's even better and

377
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,149
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to be you know kind of</font>

378
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,649
inexpensive all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> endeavor one of the</font>

379
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:36,899
best things you can do is to

380
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:39,209
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with lunch and learns and you</font>

381
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,639
know developers love free pizza so you

382
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,349
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza or in the case of our office</font>

383
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:49,110
everybody loves fireball which is a

384
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:51,929
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> stir fry police so we we bring in</font>

385
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,059
food and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a topic about you</font>

386
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,759
know one or two design patterns we keep

387
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,910
it simple and keep it focused but we're

388
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,709
looking at our own code and so we're

389
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,139
looking at our own flaws in some cases

390
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,549
there's usually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> humor associated to</font>

391
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,970
it because there's some ribbing about

392
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:11,908
who wrote the code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they wrote</font>

393
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:16,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and and how many happy hour beers</font>

394
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:18,600
they had had but it keeps it a little

395
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,449
bit lively but it's also relevant so

396
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,000
everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk about now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

397
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:26,579
directly applicable to new code in our

398
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,100
application stack however complex are

399
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:34,590
simple it maybe it's directly actionable

400
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:38,730
and that makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big difference so just</font>

401
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,408
an example of how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has gone in in</font>

402
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,399
the past with two different companies

403
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I work with and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know with each</font>

404
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,668
of these case studies I'm obviously

405
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:50,279
trying to anonymize a little bit there's

406
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:53,940
many variables there's no one variable

407
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:55,110
that defines everything but I tried to

408
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,390
pick things that were as similar as

409
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,100
possible in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

410
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:03,029
process and performance variables of the

411
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">two companies to make it fair so in the</font>

412
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:06,570
case of the first company they had a

413
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,340
mandatory computer-based kind of

414
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,860
awareness training it's very focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

415
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">awareness there was no code level</font>

416
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,918
examples in that training so everybody

417
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:20,010
took that and then one developer / team

418
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,140
was designated to receive more technical

419
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,890
training but that training was focused

420
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,299
on a generic web application in that

421
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">case I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it was actually web code</font>

422
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,830
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP web code project and we</font>

423
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looked at down to code level</font>

424
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,500
analysis but of web go right so just

425
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,770
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web go technology stack</font>

426
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,289
not what they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> building themselves</font>

427
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,500
with the other organization everybody

428
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,129
got technical train

429
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,620
and that technical training was

430
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,630
primarily from their own code but the

431
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,550
little mixture of web goat baked in so

432
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,460
we're examples couldn't be found in

433
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,330
their own code we use web code instead

434
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,480
for those examples to blend it but there

435
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:07,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a specific focus right rather than</font>

436
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,700
spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> time on the entire OS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top 10 or</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire set of findings that that we</font>

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,800
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there was a specific focus in</font>

439
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,470
taking the top findings in their

440
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">application and talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

441
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,590
remediate those particular findings and

442
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,270
walking them through in design detail

443
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,740
talking that talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and really</font>

444
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,780
engaging in a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the whole</font>

445
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,540
team about the background of that

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,280
particular code the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements the</font>

447
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,560
performance needs and then saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

448
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,750
how could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we change this and what would</font>

449
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to do to do that and so they</font>

450
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that essentially with a plan</font>

451
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,899
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would do to fix those</font>

452
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues now that second team was part of</font>

453
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,670
a pilot it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually three different</font>

454
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,270
development teams we said we did a pilot

455
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,790
with them and the was I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

456
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,350
contract but there was a commitment with

457
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,780
each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> three development teams</font>

458
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:04,959
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in exchange for receiving this</font>

459
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,700
training and<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the company making</font>

460
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,210
that investment in them they would have

461
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> commit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fixing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 issues in their</font>

462
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:16,120
application and it was a reasonable

463
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">request initially that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked was 50 and</font>

464
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,800
they they complained about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

465
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,960
it you know negotiated down to 20 so

466
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,389
they all committed to 20 things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

467
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,640
had choice right there was no it wasn't

468
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security team Russ is the consultant</font>

469
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,870
telling them which ones they had input

470
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,280
into which ones they wanted to fix and

471
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:40,659
they had a month to do it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

472
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,280
pretty reasonable so so from the results

473
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,130
of that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of comparing the two</font>

474
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,320
in that first group that first set of

475
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,850
that first organization the development

476
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">teams kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of continued as normal</font>

477
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,350
nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed for them they had</font>

478
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,840
their awareness training but very few

479
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,010
issues got fixed because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing</font>

480
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,320
tangible about their applique

481
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,030
that they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and change but they</font>

482
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,740
did learn some things and there were

483
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,050
some things that got fixed but it wasn't

484
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">fraud but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest thing was they</font>

485
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,070
from their forward they still relied on

486
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,860
the security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell them what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

487
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to do and they didn't have the</font>

488
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,129
insight about their own code to sort of

489
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,800
say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more important than</font>

490
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,380
others and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and so they you know</font>

491
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,820
they they had a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of findings but</font>

492
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,000
they relied on someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell them</font>

493
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,340
what was more important in the second

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,260
team and this was as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said this was</font>

495
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,590
three different development tools each

496
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked to fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 issues right so the</font>

497
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,209
expectation<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in a month you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 60</font>

498
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:43,070
issues and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a month of developer</font>

499
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:45,890
time the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> results was just shy of</font>

500
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:49,520
600 issues like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 590 something issues</font>

501
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:54,260
fixed and in a sum total from the three

502
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,930
teams in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 development days so they had</font>

503
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a month essentially for one</font>

504
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">person per team you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had 30</font>

505
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available to them to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 20</font>

506
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,699
issues and across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three teams they</font>

507
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,020
only actually used<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten days total and</font>

508
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,310
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was skewed even because two of the</font>

509
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,240
team's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> used two days each and the</font>

510
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:17,870
one used more but they fixed almost 600

511
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,720
issues and the reason was they had a

512
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:23,300
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so and and they actually</font>

513
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed it within about 10 days of the</font>

514
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,540
course because<font color="#E5E5E5"> once they came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

515
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,360
training course they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

516
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,879
to do it was in the terminology that

517
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,709
they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was in the exact you know</font>

518
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,160
architecture that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed and they</font>

519
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:39,680
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to do and from there forward</font>

520
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,110
they were able to recognize things about

521
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,150
their application and so in the next you

522
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,860
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't have follow-up years</font>

523
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,450
later with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next two</font>

524
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">months during the course of our pilot</font>

525
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,770
they would come back and contact us and

526
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,660
say hey we found this other thing or we

527
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,490
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an issue can you give us</font>

528
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">some advice or they would just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go fix</font>

529
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,980
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they started to reapply</font>

530
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,080
those new patterns right away to all the

531
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">new code that we're building during</font>

532
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,750
their new development cycles so there

533
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,639
was a big difference and the cost

534
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,480
investment between the two for the

535
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,590
training

536
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,970
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the same because they were</font>

537
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,580
still sending them all to training

538
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,170
they're paying per person the the

539
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,139
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference was with the pilot</font>

540
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:26,210
they spent a little bit more time on our

541
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,050
consultant<font color="#E5E5E5"> up front to learn about their</font>

542
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,900
application and you know they trained in

543
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,700
that particular application so I mean

544
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,080
yeah sure there was a little difference

545
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,280
but we're not talking hundreds of

546
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,570
thousands we're talking like five or ten

547
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,510
thousand dollars difference which isn't

548
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:46,070
very much for a pretty significant set

549
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:49,580
of results so with that some tips that

550
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can take with you about approaching</font>

551
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,550
training in your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own software</font>

552
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,129
security program so you've got to have

553
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,290
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> by there's no way that you're</font>

554
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get the approval to train every</font>

555
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,250
developer without some sort of

556
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,230
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> volume and that could mean</font>

557
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dev management it could be in</font>

558
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,900
business management but somebody at that

559
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,090
level has say this is important but the

560
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,400
value<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can take to that is to</font>

561
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">say this will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your developers</font>

562
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,950
better and faster and it will reduce the

563
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">time that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes to remediate things</font>

564
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:29,300
and that's that's enough of a carrot to

565
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:32,570
fix things another care to kind of bring

566
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,270
into that is to commit to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up</font>

567
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,860
actions right so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving the</font>

568
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,530
developers training you're helping build

569
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,560
their skills it's fair as part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

570
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:45,230
bargain to say we want it we expected X

571
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:48,290
amount of commitment afterwards you're

572
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply what you learned and that</font>

573
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,730
helps a lot both in terms of their

574
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,370
ability to retain that and reuse it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

575
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,260
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate the value that</font>

576
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for whatever dollars you</font>

577
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,340
spend on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that train whether you you it's</font>

578
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,520
time internally or a vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

579
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:08,360
bring it the vendors can certainly help

580
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,310
but again you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose wisely some</font>

581
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,679
of the vendors use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for training</font>

582
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:16,040
they use an instructor but that's a

583
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,630
teacher not a developer right so it's

584
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,070
not a someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who necessarily is</font>

585
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,140
familiar with the development or the

586
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,480
the specifics of content there's someone

587
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,170
who's trained and skilled at teaching a

588
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:32,880
class and so there's a trade-off there

589
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:34,800
and often you it's a double-edged<font color="#CCCCCC"> sword</font>

590
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,420
it can go really effectively if you take

591
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,419
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a senior architect who knows your</font>

592
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,560
application and you have them teach it

593
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,930
but it can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too if</font>

594
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,460
they're you know if it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

595
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,070
antagonistic or if they're not a good

596
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicator in front of a room of other</font>

597
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:54,330
peers so that's something to keep in

598
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,250
mind and you almost really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

599
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,470
assess who you have available on your

600
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,840
team who's skilled enough to do it who

601
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,960
has the credibility and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

602
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,830
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a room to do it or if you</font>

603
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to bring someone else in definitely</font>

604
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,620
use their own applications and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

605
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:15,750
found is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> productive thing to</font>

606
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,330
help retention and also reuse of

607
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,180
whatever they learned and then finally

608
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know development organizations are</font>

609
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:26,250
very fluid so development developers

610
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,960
move teams they change companies even so

611
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,200
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to have some refreshers built</font>

612
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,700
in on a reasonable basis and those

613
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,590
refreshers don't have to be a full-blown

614
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,500
class it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be a lunch and learn</font>

615
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,020
on a specific topic you know doing that

616
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,910
once a month or you know least once a

617
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,070
quarter is a great way to keep things in

618
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,770
touch and also gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an opportunity</font>

619
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,840
to bring in you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

620
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,430
happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketplace so one of</font>

621
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,850
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do whenever I do a lunch</font>

622
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,440
and learn and our company is I saved the

623
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:57,060
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to ten minutes and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

624
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,060
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are happening today</font>

625
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:03,030
right so either new breeches or new

626
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,429
flaws that have been reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

627
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,800
to kind of keep people a prize of new

628
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,690
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are happening out there and</font>

629
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,190
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be it sometimes it's even</font>

630
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,200
just a new dev framework that seems

631
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting and we might like but</font>

632
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that keeps it engaging and forward going</font>

633
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,689
so that the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of core area is a</font>

634
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:29,439
software security roadmap and this is an

635
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,940
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a roadmap and it's very</font>

636
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,330
similar to ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

637
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,330
past and what this does is it lays out

638
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:39,610
your priorities for what you want to

639
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,600
have addressed now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you notice I didn't</font>

640
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:46,000
have the entire OS top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 year one right</font>

641
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,840
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what your compliance auditor</font>

642
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,930
will tell you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do because for</font>

643
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,790
the large part that's not achievable so

644
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:58,240
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key things about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this roadmap</font>

645
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,820
is that it has to be achievable if if

646
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,830
the OS top 10 for your application and

647
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,429
for most applications that's thousands

648
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:10,560
of issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix that many issues is</font>

649
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:12,940
going to fully derail your business and

650
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,850
whatever that application or product is

651
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,570
so you can't do that it's got to be some

652
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:21,730
measure of things that are achievable

653
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:26,830
but also justifiable from a security

654
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:29,320
perspective and forward-looking but the

655
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,629
there's other reasons why this is

656
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,610
relevant and you know happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick a</font>

657
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:37,000
year and and that goes pretty well for

658
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,800
very large companies if you have a very

659
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,010
small development<font color="#E5E5E5"> team or very agile</font>

660
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,419
process you could set it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for quarters</font>

661
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,400
months just depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what kind of</font>

662
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,680
commitment you have to execute on those

663
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,740
things and if you change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cycle time</font>

664
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:55,390
you could also change the items<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

665
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:56,530
put in each cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to match but one of</font>

666
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,350
the key things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is its</font>

667
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,270
forward-looking so a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> development</font>

668
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,840
team and most development teams are very

669
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:07,810
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have a complete backlog right</font>

670
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,780
of probably one to two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years work of all</font>

671
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,790
the new feature and feature requests

672
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:16,510
defects that they they have to build and

673
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,490
so by having this planned out some years

674
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,890
in advance you know maybe with an

675
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,390
asterisk that says subject to change you

676
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,840
know based on you vulnerable ities that

677
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:28,030
are exposed or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has now</font>

678
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,809
done is given them a new set of

679
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,428
requirements

680
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,639
that they can fold into their

681
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:37,389
development cycle and that now is plan a

682
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:39,370
bulwark rather than being a new

683
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:43,209
requirement brought in you know

684
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:47,799
pre-release post QA that that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

685
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:50,259
emergency fix and so by doing that it's

686
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,269
an opportunity now not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all development</font>

687
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:54,039
teams will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that opportunity but</font>

688
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're good project managers you're good</font>

689
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,830
development teams will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

690
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:59,379
opportunities<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when when can we</font>

691
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:02,110
cycle<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work in when can we plan and</font>

692
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:04,748
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a fluid conversation</font>

693
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,178
right and like with any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature</font>

694
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:10,470
they may plan it in but then ultimately

695
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:13,379
move it out but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that roadmap does</font>

696
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,090
again is making it a plan requirement

697
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:18,850
but also communicating these priorities

698
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,279
to the company it's also very valuable

699
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,230
for the business sponsors because now

700
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,350
they know they've got to incorporate

701
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,840
those in or if there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font>

702
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,240
list that a business sponsor says no

703
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,908
this is more important now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got a</font>

704
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,230
sponsor who says we're going to we're

705
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:37,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do this and now they're</font>

706
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,309
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for helping you fund it or</font>

707
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:42,700
make it a priority in the development

708
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:46,119
organization and then the other key is

709
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce that untimely blocker</font>

710
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:51,850
instead of security being the group of

711
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:53,889
know it's really saying you know here's

712
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,649
what we would we want of you here's what

713
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:59,379
we're asking here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time frame going</font>

714
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:03,248
forward and you know it's up to you on

715
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:05,889
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're here to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

716
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:08,080
then finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> with any development</font>

717
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:10,149
process and most teams already have this

718
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,980
in place they're tracking how long it

719
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:14,199
takes them to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements how</font>

720
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,619
long it takes them how long things are

721
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,269
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backlog and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now you can pull</font>

722
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,928
those measurements from their own

723
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:21,929
development tools

724
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:32,820
so an example of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had two</font>

725
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:34,529
organizations the first one which sat

726
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,960
down and talked about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the key</font>

727
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:39,419
problems that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and they looked</font>

728
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,820
kind of backwards through there you know

729
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,679
incidents and previous compliance audits

730
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,059
and so that they said you know it look

731
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,480
eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the issues that we</font>

732
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that we get dinged for our</font>

733
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,739
cross-site scripting and sequel

734
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,299
injection and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM that was number one</font>

735
00:31:52,739 --> 00:31:56,279
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and we just picked something</font>

736
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,200
else that was pretty reasonable I think

737
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,720
for that when we picked race conditions

738
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,309
or something that you know they they

739
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,710
thought would help out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for with</font>

740
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:07,080
performance as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and then they took a</font>

741
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,239
rough draft at at future years and they

742
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,470
said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a rough draft but</font>

743
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:13,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we expect that we're going</font>

744
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:17,249
to prioritize for the next forward years

745
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:20,129
and they align their training to the

746
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:22,799
priorities so we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> training for them</font>

747
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:24,299
all of the training you know eighty

748
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,489
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the training was focused on</font>

749
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:27,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">the year one priorities so focused on</font>

750
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,820
sequel injection cross-site scripting

751
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,340
and race conditions and that's what we

752
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,980
spent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time on and and digging into</font>

753
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:37,009
different developments tax and different

754
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,549
application architectures that they used

755
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:43,859
in the second organization they actively

756
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:45,539
avoided prioritizing they said you know

757
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,609
there's too much there's too many<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

758
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,769
we have the most top<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten and we can't</font>

759
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:51,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can't make a choice because</font>

760
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:55,080
we don't want to deprioritize something

761
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,789
and have it slip and there was good

762
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,970
reasons for that in terms of their

763
00:32:56,789 --> 00:33:03,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">business and politics so they what they</font>

764
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,659
did was they crafted a metric and what

765
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:08,039
they decided was they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take the</font>

766
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,200
software know the results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from</font>

767
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,408
the static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> software they would</font>

768
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,799
take those priorities which<font color="#E5E5E5"> were high</font>

769
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:20,129
medium low and they waited them on a log

770
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,460
scale so you know kind of 10 for a high

771
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:27,320
one for a medium and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end point one for a</font>

772
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,389
low and then they essentially created a

773
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,059
density metric

774
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:34,309
kind of added up all of those scores for

775
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:37,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the issues and then divided by the</font>

776
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:39,289
number of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lines of code and</font>

777
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:43,039
so it became a density metric based on

778
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:46,129
the weighing and then they they drew an

779
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,019
arbitrary kind of line as to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

780
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:51,949
the pass and was a fail based on that

781
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:52,969
density so the result was for the two

782
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:55,700
organizations the first organization

783
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:59,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that drew out the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap they had</font>

784
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,700
a big drop in their key issues so the

785
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:04,190
ones they prioritize they saw a big drop

786
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,320
for now the other issues didn't get

787
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,059
fixed right away but some of the

788
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,949
development teams that you know either

789
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:11,240
had already fixed their cross-site

790
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:13,759
scripting and sequel injection issues

791
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,888
before they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time and</font>

792
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,960
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start working on future</font>

793
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,940
issues just to be ahead of the curve and

794
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,799
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they would have some released</font>

795
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability in the future are they they</font>

796
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't doing it for security they were</font>

797
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,598
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for their own purposes which</font>

798
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,700
was to have released ability to make

799
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:30,200
sure when we give a target date for when

800
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">worship we're going to ship it because</font>

801
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,480
security is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come down and</font>

802
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:39,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> train the developers on those</font>

803
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,659
priorities the second organization the

804
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:45,529
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams learn to game the</font>

805
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:48,500
system so they figured out that the the

806
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:50,899
scoring was weighted in a certain way

807
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,379
and so they would fix just<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of the</font>

808
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:58,450
high issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get below the line</font>

809
00:34:53,379 --> 00:35:01,880
whatever the density line was and

810
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,950
ultimately then the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process itself</font>

811
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,990
failed an internal audit because they

812
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,220
said you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to have</font>

813
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,479
high<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and you have no assurance</font>

814
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,950
that people are going to fix them

815
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,299
because everything is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

816
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:16,189
metric that everybody can gain and there

817
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:17,180
was no real<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are other reasons they</font>

818
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,190
failed the audit as well but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

819
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,589
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the key ones is that that metric</font>

820
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,980
is there and it was also possible to

821
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:27,049
inflate the metric by you know in

822
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,410
keeping your dead code around because it

823
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:34,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">added to your lines of code count which</font>

824
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,529
they also didn't didn't happen but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

825
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:38,150
organization was stuck as well and this

826
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:40,609
is it kind of a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge in</font>

827
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,080
that they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent so much political</font>

828
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:44,120
capital

829
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,779
behind that metric to say this is our

830
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,279
solution so that that security sponsor

831
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,150
really didn't have any political capital

832
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,820
left to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business to go change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

833
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,880
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> by talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that example</font>

834
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a lesson that you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid and</font>

835
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,840
not repeat because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ultimately didn't</font>

836
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,480
lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to big improvements in their</font>

837
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,280
applications it just led to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

838
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,120
paperwork being shuffled all around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

839
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:20,510
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> checkboxes being checked but but</font>

840
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,710
no real reduction in risk so that some

841
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,350
of the key tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I've mentioned</font>

842
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,370
most of these but got to have buy-in for

843
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,589
management on what the roadmap is

844
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:35,089
another key is that one road map isn't

845
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:37,730
likely to fit all teens and so you may

846
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:40,430
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple roadmaps one for</font>

847
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you know middleware type</font>

848
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:46,069
applications one for front-end web

849
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,750
facing applications one for pci type

850
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,400
applications because there are some

851
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,090
different priorities and different risk

852
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,920
profiles or another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to approach it</font>

853
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,940
is to have one road map but to have

854
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,730
flexibility in negotiating or change the

855
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,190
time periods so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pci</font>

856
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:07,040
applications must be you know at this

857
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,510
point but the the middleware

858
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,210
applications you can be kind of one year

859
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind or six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months or whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

860
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,970
cycle time<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so in having those</font>

861
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,220
negotiations is a good thing because

862
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,350
what it does is it engages the

863
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,359
development and architecture teams with

864
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:26,779
you and you can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the pros and</font>

865
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">cons and and having that discussion you</font>

866
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,200
know now is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve the road</font>

867
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,810
map but it also improve the

868
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,100
relationships that you have with them

869
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:38,180
rather than kind of being dictatorial

870
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:40,400
about and then and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really the</font>

871
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,649
think one of the biggest keys is the

872
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">road map should then drive your</font>

873
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:48,589
investments in training<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also tools</font>

874
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:51,140
and so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide to go purchase</font>

875
00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:53,540
tools or purchase training now you you

876
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,240
have a map of we want training that

877
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,589
doesn't this rather than having the

878
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,939
vendors come to you with a menu<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

879
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:01,520
here's the training options you have

880
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,290
which one would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> like your you're now</font>

881
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,210
proactive in your requirements of

882
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:07,759
purchasing and saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we</font>

883
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:11,060
want and you're also more able to

884
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,780
measure you know does course a or course

885
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:17,089
be better fit what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to teach and</font>

886
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,480
you can run a pilot and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

887
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:26,810
clear criteria of success of which one

888
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:31,720
is better the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step is</font>

889
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:33,830
really integrating into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> FD LCS and</font>

890
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,209
we're a little short of time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font>

891
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:40,400
a little faster here but most often and

892
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,990
often today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know it's getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

893
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,820
over the last few years but software

894
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">security can still be sometimes an ex</font>

895
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,690
post facto activity right it's towards

896
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the release and</font>

897
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,320
development cycle so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

898
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,560
earlier there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different types</font>

899
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,109
of methodologies but the key is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

900
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,549
of empower the development teams to have

901
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:03,259
security be integrated into what they do

902
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:06,680
and there's no shortage of activities

903
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,089
right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is largely waterfall but</font>

904
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,720
it essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same phases</font>

905
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:13,970
in agile and scrum and in other pieces

906
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,770
so there's lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> activities</font>

907
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:21,319
that you can do during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDLC and the</font>

908
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:24,080
the challenge is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to integrate</font>

909
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,050
them in to the process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that</font>

910
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,750
you know requirements discussion early

911
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,550
on which with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roadmap now you have</font>

912
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,320
requirements that are that are clear we

913
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:37,760
want this and here's the time frame that

914
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,920
we want it in having design reviews and

915
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,750
peer reviews and using tools or test

916
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,650
cases these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all important but they</font>

917
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:48,230
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be integrated in to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDLC the</font>

918
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,690
challenge with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and where companies</font>

919
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:54,740
have gone awry with them is when these

920
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:56,730
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checkboxes where your</font>

921
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,770
security process is

922
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,420
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best use of words but</font>

923
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,490
essentially it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you become</font>

924
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,460
process server saying have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> done this</font>

925
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:08,120
yes have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you done this yes no and now</font>

926
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes it away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from being a dialogue</font>

927
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:14,279
and and having these things so in that

928
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,380
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> current company you know one of</font>

929
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,360
the things that you know we wanted

930
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,070
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I came in was we wanted</font>

931
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have threat models for every release</font>

932
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,870
but we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when we do</font>

933
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,420
dot releases that are just essentially

934
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:30,150
bug fixes there's no architectural

935
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,670
change and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a waste of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

936
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,860
effort to take senior architects or

937
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:38,730
developers and sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for a threat</font>

938
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">model for you know every other month for</font>

939
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,710
that release made no sense so instead we

940
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,030
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're we want to do with rat</font>

941
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:49,110
models but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do them for</font>

942
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:51,330
every major release and you know that

943
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:53,160
became kind of a negotiation but we've

944
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,020
got a commitment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that so now we</font>

945
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:58,649
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a threat model for every major</font>

946
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:01,380
release and occasionally we let<font color="#CCCCCC"> one go</font>

947
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:04,440
right so we happen to have a release

948
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,360
recently that really didn't have even

949
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,220
though it was a major release it turned

950
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,720
out we had a lot of bugs in the previous

951
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,870
major release and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was bug</font>

952
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,509
fixes and so there was no new designs or

953
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,580
capabilities to to evaluate and said

954
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes this makes sense let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not do</font>

955
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:24,000
it now and we'll invest in and that you

956
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,920
can't have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialogue if all it is is</font>

957
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,770
a check<font color="#CCCCCC"> box as you lose that you want</font>

958
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,720
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> having those discussions really</font>

959
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:35,640
really drive the value so some some key

960
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,919
tips on that you know treating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

961
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:42,710
security changes as requirements so that

962
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,710
their plan a bowl and actionable

963
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:50,340
negotiating is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing and involves</font>

964
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,530
the processes themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve and they</font>

965
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't change so you can't ask a</font>

966
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,820
development team to just shift what they

967
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,100
do it's got to be iterative so you're

968
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:02,880
going to change one thing at a time over

969
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,890
time and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often not trying to</font>

970
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,480
integrate into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdlc and really</font>

971
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,359
asking the question how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we do this</font>

972
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,910
as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sto</font>

973
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,460
see that alone just asking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

974
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,640
and having the dialogue was as much of a

975
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,559
win for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from security</font>

976
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,078
the development team as it was the

977
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,539
result that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so</font>

978
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:31,730
keeping that dialogue engaged in going

979
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:34,009
forward was a real value a couple of

980
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">things on tools there's lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools</font>

981
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:42,170
out there and and there aren't bad tools

982
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,910
but tools are like hammers there's

983
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,619
ballpoint hammered ball-peen hammers

984
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:48,519
there's regular hammers there's rubber

985
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,839
mallets you know there's jackhammers and

986
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:53,410
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick the right one for what</font>

987
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:55,849
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual otherwise your break stuff and</font>

988
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,710
these tools are the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing or that</font>

989
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,720
are really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same way it's knowing</font>

990
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,819
what you want to solve and that's that's

991
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,950
what that roadmap comes in and tells you

992
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,119
this is what you want to address and are

993
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:09,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">we picking the right tools to address</font>

994
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,109
that the reality is that all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> among</font>

995
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:15,259
stall these tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ability to find</font>

996
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:19,098
vulnerabilities far exceeds our ability

997
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:21,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fix them and so the focus shouldn't</font>

998
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:25,329
be on you know what is this tool find is

999
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,579
you know how can this will help us fix

1000
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:29,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and if</font>

1001
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,569
there's this stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> left on the</font>

1002
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:38,539
shelf that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you fix</font>

1003
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:41,029
the stuff that's the most important so

1004
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:43,249
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real key there is that the</font>

1005
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:46,400
road map drives the selection and the

1006
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:48,529
criteria and you also want to empower

1007
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,279
teams to integrate things into their

1008
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:56,059
sdlc to automate them and then structure

1009
00:43:52,279 --> 00:44:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the usage of the tools around the</font>

1010
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:04,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">roadmap and around the training I think</font>

1011
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,950
for pretty short on time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have a</font>

1012
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,730
couple of slides left but what I'll do

1013
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:13,480
is I'll I'll share them online they'll

1014
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:16,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">be on SlideShare for last time I can go</font>

1015
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:20,350
a little long<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this was kind of a</font>

1016
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,380
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> study on on the tools we had two</font>

1017
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:26,950
teams both<font color="#E5E5E5"> using static analysis the</font>

1018
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:29,860
first team what they they already had in

1019
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:31,359
place a quality focus static analysis

1020
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,510
tool so they had something already in

1021
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,630
place or using it on a on a almost daily

1022
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,580
basis but because the corporate security

1023
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,220
team had adopted the security centric

1024
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:45,130
sac analysis tool they were forced to

1025
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,950
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to their sdlc and to integrate</font>

1026
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:50,770
that in and so they wasted time and

1027
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:54,279
energy to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had such a</font>

1028
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:56,170
marginal you know set of new issues to

1029
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,450
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> reported right they were fixing on</font>

1030
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:01,420
all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the company had said</font>

1031
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,799
were priorities their quality centric

1032
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,510
static analysis tool was already doing

1033
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,000
them they were already fixing them and

1034
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,850
so what it turned into was just a waste

1035
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,130
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and and a reduction in the you</font>

1036
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relationship between the</font>

1037
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:19,300

1038
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,880
this other case the integrated in a tool

1039
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,010
to run every week and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1040
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,980
they reconfigured all the results to

1041
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,320
match their roadmap and then they

1042
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:33,070
measured against that roadmap every

1043
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:35,950
release and so over time the result was

1044
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:37,780
they got better with every release but

1045
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:44,230
they did it in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that was meaningful</font>

1046
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:48,280
and aligned to the virus so some of the

1047
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:50,080
tips with buying and using tools you

1048
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,350
know aligned to the roadmap and and

1049
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">tuned you know don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be afraid to tune</font>

1050
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:57,130
the settings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results to fit your</font>

1051
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:59,140
roadmap and sometimes whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1052
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,880
consultants<font color="#E5E5E5"> or auditors they'll say oh</font>

1053
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:04,509
no you shouldn't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font>

1054
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,880
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a reference source I call BS</font>

1055
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,980
on that because what's more important is

1056
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,660
that you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> priorities that have</font>

1057
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,790
been shared and communicated and then

1058
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,839
you can stick to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and follow through</font>

1059
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:20,529
on that

1060
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:23,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">Teva balet always talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with all</font>

1061
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:26,739
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools are false positives and</font>

1062
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:29,950
false negatives and my advice generally

1063
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:32,019
it on those is get over<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of these</font>

1064
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,819
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> are perfect they're going to find</font>

1065
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:35,890
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like that that</font>

1066
00:46:33,819 --> 00:46:37,329
doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know find the</font>

1067
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickest way to ignore it and move on</font>

1068
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:42,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're going to find stuff and</font>

1069
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:44,109
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1070
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:46,539
didn't realize and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a</font>

1071
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:48,009
plan you have to have understood through

1072
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:50,049
your threat model and the other security

1073
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:52,059
activities there might be a gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1074
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:53,950
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we address it with some</font>

1075
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:58,599
other testing some other you know

1076
00:46:53,950 --> 00:47:01,689
approach and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that you can kind</font>

1077
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,400
of focus the tool to make things

1078
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:06,099
actionable for your developers and

1079
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,910
that's the best goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have</font>

1080
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:12,099
that development cycle be quick and the

1081
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,739
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know developers will write</font>

1082
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:18,430
you know tens to hundreds of lines of

1083
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:21,579
code a day so if it's a week two weeks

1084
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:24,759
three weeks before<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get feedback on</font>

1085
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:28,150
code they've written then that's long

1086
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:31,599
gone and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now any effort to go fix</font>

1087
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:33,400
that code<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now also coming with an</font>

1088
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,989
overhead of where was I at that point

1089
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,119
what were<font color="#E5E5E5"> we thinking what were those</font>

1090
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:39,279
requirements then whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font>

1091
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,130
that feedback within a day or a couple

1092
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:48,509
of days that overhead is much less and

1093
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:51,219
the result is much quicker and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

1094
00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">last set of lessons I've learned is from</font>

1095
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:57,670
joining the development and really being

1096
00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:00,460
in charge yourself and I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1097
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:03,009
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and I hope that OS has a</font>

1098
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,579
community and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking off of</font>

1099
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:07,809
what Nick mentioned is he know that we

1100
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:10,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">all incorporate that and whether that's</font>

1101
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:12,369
bringing developers in 20 oz or us

1102
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,789
joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development conferences and</font>

1103
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:18,519
going there but moving that security

1104
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:22,180
function to be product<font color="#E5E5E5"> feature product</font>

1105
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:24,640
requirement and integrating into those

1106
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,828
goals and there's there's things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1107
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,519
learned from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1108
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:32,849
incredibly valuable prioritizing is as a

1109
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:35,069
continuous balancing act and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1110
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:36,569
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I had on my road</font>

1111
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:38,819
map that I wish would have been done

1112
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:41,430
several months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll probably</font>

1113
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:43,680
be done in six months from now but

1114
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's okay because we got there</font>

1115
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,509
together we got there through a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialogue</font>

1116
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:49,739
said you know yes what this feature is

1117
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,630
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important than what I was talking</font>

1118
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:54,089
about and let's let's have the bigger

1119
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:57,930
win for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> province and that really</font>

1120
00:48:54,089 --> 00:49:01,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought us together as a group it also</font>

1121
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:03,450
improved our credibility before i joined

1122
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:06,689
the development team security was an

1123
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:09,299
external function so there was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1124
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:11,719
of back and forth constantly and once we

1125
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:13,979
had someone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development team now</font>

1126
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:16,289
developers and QA engineers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

1127
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:19,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">almost on a daily basis come see me hey</font>

1128
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:21,089
i saw this is this a concern we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

1129
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,569
would have had<font color="#CCCCCC"> that before who you were</font>

1130
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:26,239
embedded in the development team and so

1131
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:29,640
we have that kind of evolving

1132
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:31,410
organically and even though you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know our</font>

1133
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,618
metrics for the backlog of things that

1134
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:37,440
that were already you know scaled to be

1135
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:40,140
fixed before that backlog hasn't shrunk

1136
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,059
as much as I wanted the thing that has

1137
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,578
happened is we fix more issues and

1138
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:46,739
averted them at the early design and

1139
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:49,650
scoping phases than I could ever count

1140
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:51,180
and so to me that's still the better win

1141
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,229
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though there's some some issue</font>

1142
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,209
that's been there for a while that

1143
00:49:52,229 --> 00:49:55,948
hasn't gotten fixed I'm much happier

1144
00:49:54,209 --> 00:49:59,180
that new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're building are</font>

1145
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:59,180
much stronger to begin
