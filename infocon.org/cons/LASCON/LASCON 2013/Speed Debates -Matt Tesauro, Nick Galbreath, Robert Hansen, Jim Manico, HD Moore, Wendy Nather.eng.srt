wonderful three by five you don't have

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,160
to restart them cards in my hand and we

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,160
have used<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ultimate source of entropy</font>

ie my children to divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> our experts</font>

corpsman in a very small and invisible

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,990
sort of way the way this works is I will

20
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,330
propose a position statement one team

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,490
will have the affirmative the other team

22
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,979
will have the negative and we will go

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,440
team by team taking turns each team

24
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,259
member gets just one minute to explain

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,390
why they are either for or against the

26
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,319
position i'm going to announce<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,569
it'll be each team member will you go

28
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and forth then we did last time I</font>

29
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,440
don't oh you're gonna pick a team<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then a rebuttal person let's do that</font>

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,810
that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the rules are made up</font>

32
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:51,300
like right now by me so this is good I

33
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,009
don't you think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember last year I</font>

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:58,080
don't remember yesterday ok so then each

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,429
team will pick an eight let's that's

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,020
right but that's what we did each team

37
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,520
picks inappropriate and then a rebuttal

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,319
for two minutes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool perfect</font>

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,209
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for the position and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

40
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,340
one-minute rebuttal you will be arguing

41
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,590
for this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm about to mention and</font>

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,650
you will be in the negative for this

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:22,709
point oh this is I love my kids irony

44
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,120
analyst reports are a fundamental RR

45
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,280
excuse me analyst reports are

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,519
fundamental to optimally using your

who's going to run with it the position

51
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,579
is analyst reports are fundamental to

58
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,579
provide you with endless amounts of

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">information many people here in the data</font>

60
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,709
mining the information is there look it

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,389
up that way I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can guarantee you I've</font>

62
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:26,159
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very thorough that's a little</font>

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">short of two minutes I'm sorry I didn't</font>

64
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,700
have a bigger speech prepared but<font color="#E5E5E5"> mano</font>

65
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,290
said he would help me<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with it I</font>

66
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,149
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> manacle will jump in look the</font>

67
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:36,569
reality is whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like analyst</font>

68
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,060
reports or not that many siz owes CEOs

69
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,619
and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-makers who may not be</font>

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">as technical as a lot of us in the room</font>

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,260
lean<font color="#CCCCCC"> on these reports to get sound</font>

72
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:48,268
advice on how to spend money so we can

73
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,220
debate analysts we can say it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for</font>

74
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">play we can say it's research there's a</font>

75
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,989
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> positions that people</font>

76
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,940
have in this industry about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of</font>

77
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,829
analyst reports and we can we can

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,579
critique it in pen test<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all we want</font>

79
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,609
but the reality is if you're a sea level

80
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,799
of a major multinational corporation and

81
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,930
you have money to spend and you don't

82
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,430
have maybe the technical background to

83
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the decisions on your own what do</font>

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do you go read analyst reports you</font>

85
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,858
read 451 you regard nur excute Forrester

86
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,570
and these these analyst firms really

87
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,760
drive the heart of spending this is

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,770
whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it or not so as security</font>

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,449
professionals we have a chance to

90
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,289
influence these analysts to help them

91
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:34,409
make better decisions around what they

92
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:37,010
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and what sees read we do</font>

93
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:39,539
have to care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this so that's my</font>

94
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:42,510
nice nice conclusion

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,160
live with that answer so okay

96
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:50,969
now you guys need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out who's</font>

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:05:08,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to rebut Wendy Wendy who may or</font>

98
00:04:50,970 --> 00:05:09,720
may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an analyst</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because analysts</font>

99
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,340
are not technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what</font>

100
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,320
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing analysts are absolutely</font>

101
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,659
dispensable you can go your whole life

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,159
happily without ever seeing a magic

103
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:26,850
quadrant you can go for happily your

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,340
whole life without seeing a wave the

105
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,620
truth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter is that analysts put</font>

106
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,440
their pants on two legs at a time just

107
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else they usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

108
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:44,790
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a from a failed career as an actual</font>

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,610
technical person they're bitter that

110
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,440
they're confused and somebody will pay

111
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to write about this bitterness and</font>

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,280
confusion all day and and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drink</font>

113
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,260
at conferences that they pay to drink at

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,450
conferences so yes yet you can

115
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,450
absolutely skip all the analyst reports

116
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,799
so what so Wendy Wendy I understand what

117
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,508
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from but the reality but</font>

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,949
no analysts may put their pants on like

119
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,120
everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they at least know</font>

120
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the front and back is so so again</font>

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,990
the truth here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even those of us</font>

122
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,179
who are very technical security

123
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,659
professionals in the know how many of

124
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,620
you have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to analyze and and talk to</font>

125
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:39,810
and discuss what 300 different vendors

126
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,599
are doing in our space very few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

127
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,300
have that have that capability of time

128
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,039
where analysts that's what they do they

129
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,599
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually folks who come from a strong</font>

130
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,389
technical background and a strong

131
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,500
writing background they have the

132
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,509
contextual ability and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,710
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask the right questions and</font>

134
00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:00,210
what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing 24-7 is they are</font>

135

<font color="#CCCCCC">communicating with different vendors to</font>

140
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,409
no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is a process that</font>

141

really drives the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart of our industry</font>

difference they drive purchasing for a

148
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,500
lot of companies it's our responsibility

149
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,719
of security analysts to do our best<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

150
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,940
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> inform different analysts about</font>

what they write about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what decisions</font>

152
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,190
they're making in terms of what we see

153
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,190
in these reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Tim be rebuttal</font>

154
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,150
unfortunately analysts try to take 300

155
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:49,199
for vendors and normalize them so they

156
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,150
somehow make<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apples-to-apples</font>

157
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">comparison unfortunately these feathers</font>

158
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,479
don't compare in the first place I'm

159
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">walking into the building of a large</font>

160
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,589
analyst firm and they just put someone

161
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,389
else in charge of pen testing as a

162
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,830
category<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're discussing kind of</font>

163
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,750
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit does and what we do in</font>

164
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pen testing field and you kind of</font>

165
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,719
went back like what what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

166
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,549
like well that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does we do</font>

167
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,620
network testing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> medication</font>

168
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,779
testing passwords vulnerabilities

170
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,400
but I thought pen testing is just web

171
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,300
apps

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break the rules say one</font>

more thing let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you an example of</font>

174
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,770
of your out of your average analyst you

175
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,330
ready so as a former practitioner I'm

176
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,669

arguing in the positive you will be

arguing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the negative the position</font>

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,720
statement is in the new world of DevOps

222
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,410
and configuration management if layer

00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,600
should consider it compromised period if

226
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,519
you're doing it right right you never

227
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,980
actually log into a server you have

228
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,220
ansible puppet chef salt whatever do

229
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,350
that for you so in this new world of

230
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,709
DevOps and configuration management if a

consider it compromised chuck it away

233
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:40,079
fire up<font color="#CCCCCC"> anew okay that is your position</font>

234
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:43,380
positive your position negative who's

235
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go first all right so yeah I've</font>

236
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,470
actually heard a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

237
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,300
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have such a thing</font>

238
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,370
as a hardened operating system I think

239
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,170
that's that's probably true when it

240
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,449
comes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box when you when you</font>

241
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,469
first get it day one like when it's

242
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:58,229
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the plastic and everything</font>

243
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,930
assuming it didn't come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China or</font>

244
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,259
the other say it's probably it's

245
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,300
probably you know good to go the second

246
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,010
you actually turn it on the second you

247
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,420
actually install the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it starts</font>

248
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,870
making outbound calls the internet

249
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,729
starts pulling in patches

250
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,650
it starts requesting stuff from github

251
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,089
and all this crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff for all these</font>

252
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,100
packages and all these sort of sub

253
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:21,339
dependencies and so on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> making calls</font>

over the internet bgp tcp/ip all this

we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about man the middle</font>

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,779

something that it modifies first time

266
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,670
there's really no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to know what's</font>

270
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,390
and you've logged in it's basically

271
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,920
impossible to know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

272
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,990
computer at that point there's no way to

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,819
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of baseline and make sure that it's</font>

any future vulnerabilities from from

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that original baseline was so go to</font>

carrier pigeon hit area prison who's

279
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">arguing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the negative Robert you</font>

280
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,089
ignorant you you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

281
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,370
there is pure agile or pure waterfall or

282
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,990
in this case pure DevOps that might be

283
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world but that's not way the real</font>

284
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,140
world works what most organizations do

285
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:35,920
is they take<font color="#CCCCCC"> you up so you agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

286
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:38,110
let me finish baby so most organizations

287
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,550
look at DevOps and they take elements of

288
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,160
it that they want to implement in their

289
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,469

there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always exceptions to the rule in</font>

295
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,540
extreme circumstances where you want to

00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:01,150
let a trusted administrator with root

access ma get to that device and handle

298
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,770
some kind of tactical issue so that's

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the real world works do we</font>

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,160
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always an exception to the rule</font>

309

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a tactical situation where</font>

316
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,810
the news recently a company lost 172

317
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,030
thousand dollars every 45 seconds for

318
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,130
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour sorry every second for for 45</font>

319
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,510
minutes straight they did this because

320
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">they weren't using figuration management</font>

321
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,460
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install a new a new</font>

322
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">update to their high-speed trading</font>

323
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,060
platform and instead of doing it through

324
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,980
figuration software like puppet they

325
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,290
mainly had an engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into eight</font>

326
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,940
servers one after another going through

<font color="#E5E5E5">an installing the update unfortunately</font>

328
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,600
the very last server of this cluster

329
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,160
they the update didn't take the engineer

330
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,690
didn't notice it in time it wasn't air

331
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,250
condition that he saw and they kept on

332
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing the business unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

334
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,880
operation to occur which<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost them what</font>

335
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,150
was it like 320 million dollars in the

336
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,370
course of the day 75<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 25 billion</font>

337
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,620
dollars and which they got fine 12

338
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,240
million dollars for doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're</font>

339
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,620
bankrupt and they're gone so that's a

340
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good case for automating your</font>

341
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:37,060
difficult deployments and updates yeah

342
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:46,960
we got we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rebuttal oh hey hey hey</font>

343
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:49,030
Jim 1993 called you<font color="#CCCCCC"> devops show do we</font>

344
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,130
have a rebuttal of course we do well

345
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,360
then please I mean a good one other your

346
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">do any of your other teammates have a</font>

347
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,150
rebuttal I'm the spokesman of the team

348
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,380
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay HD you made a</font>

349
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good point there there are</font>

350
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,330
situations where folks who are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

351
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,280
direct access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a server and then not</font>

352
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,690
doing their diligence due diligence

353
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,939
after the fact that could lead to

354
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,210
significant harm I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that one</font>

355
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,210
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

356
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,600
but but but but the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in</font>

357
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,180
security is not for the sake of security

358
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,700
we are security professionals to enable

359
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,979
some kind of business driver that's why

360
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,660
we're that's why we're here that's what

361
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,940
pays our bills that would make the world

362
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,150
go round there are going to be tactical

363
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,070
situations where not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody but</font>

364
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,079
the right guy in the room the right

365
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,850
administrator with the right level of

366
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,220
privilege and professionalism and

367
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,840
technical capability where they're going

368
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a tactical move and</font>

369
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,490
update a server live to handle something

370
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's hurting the business in some way</font>

371
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,870
now should you stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> there HD no you</font>

372
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:54,670
should you should then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and fix</font>

373
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,920
your puppet scripts drop that server

374
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,709
when you can and go back to the proper

375
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,089
processes if you stop by<font color="#CCCCCC"> just logging in</font>

376
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,060
route making a fixed and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

377
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:06,579
ends that's a problem but I still think

378
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,069
there are cases where allowing that to

379
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,800
happen is acceptable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle a</font>

380
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,899
business driver it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty it could</font>

381
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,490
lead to leave your security events if

382
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,950
you don't do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> due diligence after</font>

383
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,470
the fact but it's still a necessity<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

384
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:25,420
the real world where I live where James

negative the next topic is post-snowden

404
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:46,700
NIST and I st right cipher<font color="#CCCCCC"> suites cannot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">suites and you're arguing you heard of</font>

411
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:09,430
the man yes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm from the</font>

413
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:21,289
come back Jim so NIST standards cannot

414
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,940
be trusted how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you over here</font>

415
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:34,340
tusk trust the standards that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

416
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:36,259
published by NIST enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm like</font>

417
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,928
to line cord for me to write that diner

418
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,580
so so you heard Nick Galbraith this

419
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,499
morning speak about this as well and he

420
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,168
talked about the cipher standard right

421
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:49,519
from 2007 it's been kind of insecure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

422
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:52,669
I think he said it is standard and I've

423
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,379
said again not a few words and take a

424
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:57,049
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at silent circle I mean they</font>

425
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:59,779
recently dropped both missed hashing and

426
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:02,929
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket and symmetric crypto they moved</font>

away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES 22 fish and they moved</font>

428

00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe whirlpool so those who are</font>

the migration away from this standards

433
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,779
if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of the largest</font>

00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:19,249
security companies in the world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

in their products some are even dropping

440
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,939
these standards from their products can

441
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,408
we can we trust them and Bruce

447
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,229
are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to prove in a</font>

450
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,450
mathematics which again is really

a crypto algorithm is secure you put it

455
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:03,229
and let time go by there's no

457
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,710
throw against it to see if it works so

458
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,149
we have to go on trust to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree</font>

459
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,369
with especially the elite of these

algorithms and especially at NIST that

461
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:15,678
trust is broken of boredness standards

462
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,499
thank you so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank the first</font>

the ability to analyze it to find

that the specific miss standard in this

about how poor everyone else's of

generator you can protect against

486
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,360
everybody but the NSA at this point so

487
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:09,369
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is who are you defending</font>

488

you choose as an alternative been vetted

490
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,439
and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like at this point the new</font>

491
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:17,460
standard algorithms really are the best

492
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:24,669
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can't do any better</font>

493
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:27,129
rebuttal we can do better and in terms

there's plenty of other choices that are

have the Shah family yes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

500

better their algorithms again like

504
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:50,529
down to trust and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at</font>

505
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,600
what's happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world look at</font>

506
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,309
what security professionals think look

507
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,619
at what real world security companies

508
00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:00,190
are doing it is time to abort this

509
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:02,619
standards unfortunately thank you buttle

510
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,409
yeah so that's that's an incredible

511
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,490
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud by the way um oh this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

512
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:08,499
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who says crypto doesn't matter</font>

513
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,240
anymore so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you why get</font>

514
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:14,200
that email out why crypto doesn't matter

515
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:18,009
anymore if you if you actually look at

516
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,440
what very large military organizations

517
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:23,169
are doing they're not breaking crypto as

518
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,700
their primary attack mechanism at all

519
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,289
that is not what they're starting with

520
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,080
they start with normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like</font>

521
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:30,850
botnets and you know rubber hoses and

522
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,678
like the traditional type of hacking

523
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,908
into stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you expect because it</font>

524
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:37,120
turns out it's a hell of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper</font>

525
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:40,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that any type of breaking</font>

526
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">crypto is significantly lower on the</font>

527
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,129
value of return on investment type stuff

528
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever consider doing so in</font>

529
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,210
terms of should you which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the which</font>

530
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,429
was the question should you use nist

531
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,020
absofreakinlutely you use every bit of

532
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,870
crypto you possibly can that has been

533
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,970
vetted as long as it has if you're

534
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,399
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a nuclear bomb and</font>

535
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,140
I need to you know protect it yeah but

536
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,420
you shouldn't probably be using any sort

537
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,530
of you know that type of encrypted you

538
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,740
should be using in like one-time pads

539
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,850
you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using any sort of</font>

540
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,490
normal crypto that you'd normally run

541
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:15,070
across so yes go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use it you're</font>

542
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,540
fine your<font color="#CCCCCC"> government's not might not be</font>

543
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,220
fine so they should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using</font>

544
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,510
something different but you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be just</font>

545
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:26,640
okay all right out of frames a shadow

546
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:30,429
and I shot who believes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this team</font>

547
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:41,429
I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> dizzy over there one the</font>

548
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:41,429
speed debate and this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here</font>

549
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:52,690
who feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like giving some mercy to this</font>

550
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:55,450
team over here apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody all</font>

551
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:57,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highly scientific audio kappa yeah</font>

552
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:01,030
so you folks don't trust miss but didn't

553
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:04,479
believe us remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm from the</font>

554
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,700
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm here to help all</font>

555
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,450
right next topic and in this one let's

556
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:14,530
see for you were arguing negative you

557
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">are arguing positive yes yes okay a</font>

558
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,950
little background so we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DevOps</font>

559
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:21,669
world right this is the brave<font color="#CCCCCC"> new world</font>

560
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:25,240
we live in and the prior to DevOps world

561
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,680
where Jim apparently lives there's this

562
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,840
thing of a developer and there's this

563
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,940
thing of a system administrator well in

564
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,070
the new DevOps world titles like

565
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,780
developer and system administrator need

566
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,540
to change and we all just need to be

567
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,070
engineers right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> truly and DevOps</font>

568
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,379
if you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps right you are</font>

569
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,580
just an engineer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be writing code</font>

570
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,110
you may be pushing code you may be

571
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,830
changing server settings it doesn't

572
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:52,600
matter we're all just engineers so a

573
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:54,399
team yes you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the fact that</font>

574
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,929
everyone should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be engineers you</font>

575
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,280
believe there should be developers and

576
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:02,560
sis<font color="#E5E5E5"> admits and positive team goes first</font>

577
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,560
that's that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right yeah yeah</font>

578
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:09,040
pipe down mr. Manik oh yeah good luck

579
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,980
with that one alright so once upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

580
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,590
time in the Pleistocene age there were

581
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,170
actual real system administrators who

582
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,970
understood the entire stack of the

583
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:21,250
systems that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were responsible for</font>

584
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,960
yes they wrote code they they

585
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,850
troubleshooted things that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

586
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,890
developers who wrote the software didn't

587
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,020
understand they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of the network</font>

588
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,030
they took care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then as</font>

589
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,940
time went by people became<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and more</font>

590
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:36,070
specialized usually horizontally so you

591
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,450
have exchanged administrators who know

592
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,659
absolutely nothing about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

593
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,060
operating system you have developers and

594
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,370
you have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who only specialize in a</font>

595
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">very small piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something and if you</font>

596
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">try getting all of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people together</font>

597
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:52,780
to troubleshoot seven layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a stack</font>

598
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,970
to figure out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know</font>

599
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,990
how hard it's become these days so I

600
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,570
personally

601
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,309
absolutely in favor of DevOps bringing

602
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,678
everybody back to the same stack

603
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:05,139
resetting 20 and having everybody

604
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,230
responsible for the same thing together

605
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:16,690
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only get better as long</font>

606
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:19,090
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can spell engineer yes your turn</font>

607
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,770
your turn is DevOps important sure it is

608
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,959
are there a lot of benefits to dev ops

609
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,179
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are should you be</font>

610
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,270
applying the DevOps to every single

611
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:30,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> software that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> building</font>

612
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,020
absolutely not for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

613
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,879
take a case<font color="#E5E5E5"> study of Etsy probably one</font>

614
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,820
of the leaders in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of real world</font>

615
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,940
DevOps so they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> DevOps on their</font>

616
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,669
website they do not do<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps on their</font>

617
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,470
credit card storage infrastructure they

618
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,210
have traditional administrators they

619
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,740
have traditional developers and do more

620
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,260
of a waterfall process because of the

621
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:52,420
sensitive of that application<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not</font>

622
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,150
dissing DevOps is it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty</font>

623
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,660
outstanding thing James but if you apply

624
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:01,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that tool to every single situation</font>

625
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,790
you're going to screw yourself over big

626
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,590
time need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply the proper process</font>

627
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,290
the proper breath addala g and the

628
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:10,659
proper tool to the proper situation and

629
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,450
DevOps is not always the right tool it

630
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">often is but not always and so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

631
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:18,550
cases where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still need traditional</font>

632
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,309
administrators and traditional

633
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,139
developers just like search situations

634
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,910
just engineers or all you need it

635
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:34,450
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> situation thank you very</font>

636
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:37,150
much I don't want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in a dress</font>

637
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,730
I'm sorry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> where who the skirts at epic</font>

638
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,309
at home and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am proud of it Don't Ask</font>

639
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:44,260
Don't Tell if you would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rebut am</font>

640
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I tired of Jim's rhetorical questions</font>

641
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:52,190
yes I am

642
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:53,840
I also like to remind Tim when bue the

643
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,580
question actually was should people have

644
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,260
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> titles or not so I'm not sure</font>

645
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">where he went but I'm not sure with you</font>

646
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,930
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases you</font>

647
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,030
need engineers and developers and some

648
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,640
cases you just title engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good</font>

649
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:10,280
enough that's what I said HD but what do

650
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:15,890
you call them I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

651
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:18,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about developers administrators</font>

652
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,170
in some cases and just engineers and

653
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:24,980
others so I another statement in support

654
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:26,750
of having a run out the same title some

655
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,430
feel you know in every operation every

656
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,110
business someone is stuck holding the

657
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,940
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pooh stick someone has</font>

658
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,280
described the toilet in this case we

659
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,770
usually call them QA or any organization

660
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,389
haha they could be your security guy

661
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,370
that could be your sis admin who is

662
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,750
running for our servers and doesn't need

663
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,090
to old sport what was being stuck with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

664
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,280
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least fun job given his</font>

665
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,540
resource that available it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

666
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the same titles you have to</font>

667
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,389
get them in the same room<font color="#E5E5E5"> you treat them</font>

668
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,620
the same so the poor schlub over there

669
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,630
scrubbing toilets isn't feeling as being

670
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,699
singled out for being so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind the</font>

671
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,990
rest organization for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> role so</font>

672
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,850
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know as when he</font>

673
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">stated giving them the same title giving</font>

674
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,149
them the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a platform really</font>

675
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,160
helps people work better together it

676
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,480
doesn't result in these different schism

677
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,340
different layers you don't have these

678
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,770
devs<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus opposite ops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> words rings</font>

679
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,610
office admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> harder to point</font>

680
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,930
the finger when you point you<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

681
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:16,639
yourself it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually done so so hits</font>

682
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,990
be as much as I respect you man I'm

683
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,030
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disagree with you on</font>

684
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,460
this one so so i think the the the

685
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,440
clarification that needs to be made to

686
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">edit I team over there is it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

687
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,930
about the titles<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people hold but</font>

688
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the roles that they play</font>

689
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,460
behind those titles it's like when you

690
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,380
go down to if you if you're flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an</font>

691
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,060
airplane if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call the flight</font>

692
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,560
attendant the pilot and the pilot the

693
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,530
flight attendant and call them the same

694
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing then in that case you know and if</font>

695
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,950
they don't know what their roles are

696
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,780
necessarily to be then I don't think you

697
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,550
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to land very safely and</font>

698
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,780
I wondered that's probably one of the

699
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,470
reasons why they call these endpoints

700
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,840
terminals<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

701
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that correct distinction then your</font>

702
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,720
software or your systems whatever you

703
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,020
with one of our technology with the

704
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,520
whatever process you have is going to be

705
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:11,158
terminated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be back nicely</font>

706
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">done all right it's time for the highly</font>

707
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,510
scientific voting method once again who

708
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:28,110
believes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this team won this debate</font>

709
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:37,890
round who believes that team won the

710
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:39,780
debate round do we have a judgment team

711
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,890
will first thing so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font>

712
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:46,649
terse team so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now 22 yes tied up</font>

713
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,000
to 22<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right a little background</font>

714
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:53,340
before we get to this i won i should

715
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 404 this question you</font>

716
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,418
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the positive and you guys are in</font>

717
00:31:55,049 --> 00:32:00,510
the negative because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need paper</font>

718
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:02,429
because my brain won't cash anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

719
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,200
so back up a little bit we're in a

720
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,880
software-as-a-service world right you

721
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,770
let software as a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you if your</font>

722
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">gmail to handle all your rail and if you</font>

723
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,020
everything else probably that comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

724
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">email cuz email secure quote quote what</font>

725
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,230
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's not part of the</font>

726
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,460
thing that's me being sarcastic sorry I

727
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,049
couldn't help anyway in a

728
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,470
software-as-a-service world we have a

729
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:23,820
lot of trust and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

730
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,919
a software as a service provider could

731
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,750
provide it could offer as an option is

732
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,659
transparent encryption so they would

733
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:33,270
hold your key and encrypt your data

734
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,039
before they wrote to disk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

735
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,260
what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I say transparent</font>

736
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,789
encryption okay like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just send you</font>

737
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">data and it magically gets encrypted</font>

738
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:46,080
okay so transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption by</font>

739
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,750
software as a service vendor has value

740
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,789
and we do not agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this you do not</font>

741
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,789
agree with this you agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

742
00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:11,090
hey going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and HD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more just leaving</font>

743
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:25,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright here goes positive so we are so</font>

744
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,779
lib I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask a question how many</font>

745
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have found situations where you</font>

746
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:31,980
have internally managed the key and

747
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,509
you've resorted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the development teams</font>

748
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,820
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that key</font>

749
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:39,090
configuration and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and</font>

750
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,639
that software has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploited right</font>

751
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,590
it's found in the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's found some</font>

752
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:45,840
configuration file<font color="#CCCCCC"> its and clear text so</font>

753
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,269
we're relying on our own cell to be able

754
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to manage that key damn I'm saying</font>

755
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:51,350
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it</font>

756
00:33:54,889 --> 00:34:01,070
alright so let's face it<font color="#CCCCCC"> most people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

757
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,600
not good at key management especially

758
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,908
enterprises and it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> M key management</font>

759
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not easy it's been like the year of</font>

760
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:12,089
pki for what 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so absolutely</font>

761
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,069
part of the value is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in SAS</font>

762
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:17,129
providers who understand how to use it

763
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:19,349
and manage it properly and let's face it

764
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,359
for the for the the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the</font>

765
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:24,720
enterprise is just better out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

766
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,909
hands well it's also about thread magan

767
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,290
right every day Bob's team and they

768
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,169
should know this and I'm worried that

769
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other side doesn't know this should</font>

770
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,668
be faced on one major challenge how many

771
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the great maple syrup</font>

772
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:41,368
eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2013 this is the thing it turns</font>

773
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,219
out that there are strange cartels that

774
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:46,530
will come in and with a semi and steal

775
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:49,379
your servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> maths right and at that</font>

776
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">point you don't need massive know</font>

777
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,578
awesome pki systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsm you don't</font>

778
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,800
need all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what you need instead</font>

779
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:57,329
is one guy who remember to use the

780
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,160
encryption key<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should all be</font>

781

<font color="#E5E5E5">defending against the Mexican cartel</font>

782
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,328
with a semi model and this is the

783
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,910
easiest way to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we don't</font>

784
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:08,160
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your expensive pki we don't</font>

785
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,410
your highfalutin security what we need

786
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a card that says I encrypt</font>

787
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,910
it this way and that'll pretty much

788
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:16,500
solve the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that was that was</font>

789
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:22,440
horribly awful and not correct at all

790
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:24,809
but here's Jim so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the whole</font>

791
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,920
purpose of asymmetric cryptography what

792
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:27,930
are the what are some of the

793
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,299
cryptographic benefits that are gained

794
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:33,240
when these are used by individual one of

795
00:35:30,299 --> 00:35:35,160
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> is non-repudiation and when you</font>

796
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,140
give those keys up and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider is</font>

797
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,390
that in charge of managing those keys

798
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,629
when legal situations come up that

799
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,859
non-repudiation goes away let's look at

800
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,109
I don't want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the negative</font>

801
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:47,759
we know plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples of providers</font>

802
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,220
who manage the keys for their

803
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,230
cryptography for you an example of ones

804
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't look at twitter twitter</font>

805
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,849
rolled out probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the best</font>

806
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:58,460
multi-factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication mechanisms</font>

807
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,720
in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

808
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,339
requirement of it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even if their</font>

809
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,859
servers are compromised their

810
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,680
multi-factor system is not so your

811
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:09,869
mobile device generates and stores<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

812
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,720
key and they never<font color="#CCCCCC"> have even a clue what</font>

813
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:14,609
it is and that's in you can read other

814
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,069
article to describe more details of it

815
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:19,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the key is held by us as individuals</font>

816
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:21,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">not by the organization and it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

817
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,539
very effective mechanism for

818
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:27,058
authentication so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible for</font>

819
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:30,329
individual end users to manage their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own</font>

820
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys when a provider does it for you at</font>

821
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:35,369
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lose non-repudiation</font>

822
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:38,009
if not much much worse it makes it that

823
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">much easier for abuse which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

824
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,779
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to avoid in this day and age</font>

825
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:45,150
I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rebuttal of the room at</font>

826
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:47,609
the rebuttal<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok go through your rebuttal</font>

827
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,930
so maintaining the key talking about it

828
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:51,000
like they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the key</font>

829
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,049
that doesn't look if you tweet that key

830
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,029
out like you're taking for example

831
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:59,099
Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's Twitter's multi fat new</font>

832
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:00,420
multi factor system where the private

833
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,430
key that drives the heart of it is

834
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,289
stored on the device and then the push

835
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,288
notification comes back to approve of

836
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,390
that request they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not store the keys</font>

837
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:11,220
it's individually stored so even if

838
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,990
twitter servers are compromised the

839
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,720
authentication mechanism is not that's

840
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible it's one small example of</font>

841
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a large task provider where the keys are</font>

842
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,049
managed by the

843
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:26,558
individual users and not by the

844
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:30,359
organization thank you Jim I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

845
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:34,059
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> inform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you sir you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will put it up</font>

846
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:39,220
like that no but I I read the news<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

847
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:42,730
don't i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> from india is that it for your</font>

848
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:44,529
rebuttal or do we abort yeah well then

849
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,599
the rebuttal of the rebuttal oh we

850
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,760
haven't we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> robe on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're</font>

851
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,430
good the horse is dead don't kick it

852
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,539
let's go are you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to say</font>

853
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,089
anything at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm into you</font>

854
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:58,839
eight please we're and see this point

855
00:37:55,089 --> 00:38:02,319
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right mmm so let me count the ways</font>

856
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:04,119
in which that is a bad idea SQL

857
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,650
injection bad idea you're bypassing all

858
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,220
the crypto it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking</font>

859
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,270
matter cross-site request forgery

860
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,549
cross-site scripting where I can grab

861
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,799
the data out or cause you know conflict

862
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:15,819
on the system or do whatever I want

863
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,559
command injection I just pull it

864
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:20,500
straight out of the system if I'm an

865
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:22,660
administrator a DBA<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

866
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,640
keys and I've access to the data like in

867
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,720
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible attack scenario that</font>

868
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,089
you'd actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data out</font>

869
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,500
you'll get the data out because the keys

870
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:31,150
are stored right there I've actually

871
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,220
walked into a number of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

872
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,839
it's like the key is like literally part

873
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,578
of the data you just once you have s

874
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,160
co-injection you have literally both

875
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,420
things in the same request even yes

876
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,009
they're encrypting it but it doesn't

877
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking matter because you have all the</font>

878
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,819
things you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the data out and</font>

879
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:47,529
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very pervasive it is a terrible</font>

880
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:49,329
terrible idea you should have complete

881
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,859
isolation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key and the data those</font>

882
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:53,079
things should not even be close to one

883
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:56,650
another if at all possible not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even on</font>

884
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:57,910
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but yeah but you can</font>

885
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:00,369
also agree with these people if you feel

886
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,828
like it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our rebuttal now</font>

887
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,750
actually go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like i said the rules</font>

888
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:06,339
over us to started that it likes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

889
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,349
beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and time goes here here so the</font>

890
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:10,270
question wasn't is it the be all and end

891
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:12,760
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was does it have some value</font>

892
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,220
and so story really in volatile memory

893
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,049
right so again it does actually protect

894
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,490
against an actual threat right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

895
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:20,079
people walking into data centers it's

896
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,788
ready to take stuff give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me one actual</font>

897
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,700
threat if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's an actual</font>

898
00:39:21,789 --> 00:39:26,349
threat one right which one the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

899
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,788
still in a bunch of your servers this is

900
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:28,600
actually a threat is nothing called cold

901
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:30,790
boots and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

902
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data again it's not about whether it</font>

903
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,390
provides it a defense against all

904
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,770
possible attacks that wasn't the

905
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,950
question was does it provide it it's

906
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessary to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get out an attack yeah as I</font>

907
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,669
said two<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if people start</font>

908
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,000
dumping liquid nitrogen on everything in

909
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,920
sight we the hackers win right so that

910
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,960
cold boot doesn't happen that often

911
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,200
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because liquid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nitrogen</font>

912
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's expensive and people spent like</font>

913
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">what movie man that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible</font>

914
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,760
we don't have to defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it against every</font>

915
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,140
possible attack we can defend against

916
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,480
the great<font color="#E5E5E5"> people syrup it's our well</font>

917
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,040
again Fanning it I guess data at rest is

918
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,540
going to be compromised and you can't

919
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,090
compromise it if it's encrypted and

920
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,920
stored in volatile memory so we win

921
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,500
because yes something is better than

922
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,690
nothing shocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the if the if the</font>

923
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,300
question was it provide any value<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

924
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:18,490
terms of like above zero that's probably

925
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">true but it also adds a lot of negative</font>

926
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,810
if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat it that way all</font>

927
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,460
right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's voting time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

928
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to bother to even like get behind</font>

929
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:42,460
your aim on this one who believes this

930
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:44,380
team won that round and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> team well</font>

931
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,730
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your mercy i submit your</font>

932
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,930
servers to me so I can hack them all

933
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:51,310
show you why<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not actually true</font>

934
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,740
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right door your key with the</font>

935
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,120
ciphertext<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go you go with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

936
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,830
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> way out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drawing</font>

937
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,790
please put your IP address down and

938
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:05,440
we'll email it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robert Hanson all</font>

939
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:07,960
right last and final question internal

940
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,170
of an identity models you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

941
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,410
traditional a decentralized<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp whatever</font>

942
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:17,320
right are no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer valid in the world</font>

943
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:20,830
of cloud that is the position statement

944
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:25,660
in this case team the far team is the

945
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:28,720
negative and you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the positive it no</font>

946
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:32,020
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> valid so it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not valid so ad</font>

947
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,700
and internal identity bit you are you

948
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,280
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are positive that it does not</font>

949
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">work you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do not believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it works they</font>

950
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:47,619
believe it works

951
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:49,299
uh it's hey man whatever you you believe

952
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:51,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that active directory and those</font>

953
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,000
traditional like my big all my company

954
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,520
day to be an ldap does not work in cloud

955
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,280
does not work in clown you agree that it

956
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,369
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you negative and</font>

957
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:06,490
say you agree it does so we do we not

958
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:11,920
like ad we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ad all right I</font>

959
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:13,328
will stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> here then and go Robert I like</font>

960
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,430
to ask you a question you have a moment

961
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:17,800
have you ever had a chance to audit at

962
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:21,368
Active Directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup did you have any</font>

963
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,890
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually popping it in trouble I</font>

964
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:26,950
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took me like 10 minutes I mean</font>

965
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:29,770
did you get you a would you tell us

966
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:31,270
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AD there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

967
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:33,940
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it i mean it's usually</font>

968
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:36,160
pretty shitty windows credential stuff

969
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,930
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's you know it's there's</font>

970
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing really there's none almost none</font>

971
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:42,759
ever but does windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a security</font>

972
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:47,280
history with problems in general or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

973
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,280
mean only<font color="#E5E5E5"> it since tuesday</font>

974
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,060
so these technologies that you're asking

975
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to to consider for the cloud are</font>

976
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,590
already technologies that have such

977
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:59,530
major historical problems and now you're

978
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:02,770
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to use those in the cloud at a</font>

979
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,440
scale that normal organizations don't

980
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">even have to deal with it's just a</font>

981
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,040
nonsensical thing to debate these are

982
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,260
technologies that had limited viability

983
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,460
in the real world anyways and now you

984
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,440
want to push from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud where you</font>

985
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,450
have to scale at a level that these

986
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,270
technologies can't even begin to scale

987
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:20,799
you want to use ldap in a world where

988
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,050
you're handling millions of concurrent

989
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,380
users good luck<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that you want to</font>

990
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:28,720
handle ad for tens if not hundreds of

991
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,730
million users<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an active service good</font>

992
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,680
luck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that these technologies had</font>

993
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,840
problems in the first place you even

994
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,660
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use them at scale they fall</font>

995
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">apart in many ways they're dead leave</font>

996
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,450
them dead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's move on to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

997
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:44,650
better thank you very much this public

998

I'm here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> teach you a new word it's</font>

1001
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:58,090
called Federation that's worth great

1002
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,660
that's a great marketing term from these

1003
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,180
different providers no doubt evaporation

1004

not at no single ad directory has to do

1005
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,839
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> by itself and in fact in the</font>

1006
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:10,120
enterprise it generally doesn't having

1007
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:13,240
said that I have plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of clients who</font>

1008
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">are using ad on massive massive scales</font>

1009
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,830
and it works just fine it don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1010
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,330
scared by this whole cloud thing oh my

1011
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,060
god cloud we don't know what's happening

1012
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:24,069
in it the fact of the matter is people

1013
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,900
are using cloud people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using hybrid</font>

1014
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:28,390
environments people are still in the

1015
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,180
enterprise and they it it's all working

1016
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,580
just fine now in cases where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1017
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">different layers of governance you do</font>

1018
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,140
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do multiple overlapping circles</font>

1019
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,290
and this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Federation comes in</font>

1020
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:44,379
but there's absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing 80 is not</font>

1021
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:46,660
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> die it is never going to die so</font>

1022
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,180
it absolutely has value and it's working

1023
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,160
today and it's scaling today so your

1024
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,470
clients are using these technologies

1025
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,330
this from the lady who told us just a

1026
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:58,450
few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the whole analyst</font>

1027
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,940
industry is is useless<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nonsensical I</font>

1028
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,589
want to put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

1029
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:07,230
hey you were on this side at that time

1030
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:08,520
by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am NOT and I don't I don't</font>

1031
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,860
think the issue is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether</font>

1032
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,600
ad is by itself a technology that secure

1033
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,130
or not secure it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you</font>

1034
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,150
actually implement Eddie within the

1035
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,220
different environments that you're going

1036
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in in today's world right weather</font>

1037
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,399
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about ad but</font>

1038
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,380
realistically today everything has come

1039
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,090
down to a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign-on whether you you</font>

1040
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,170
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you open an app on your thing and</font>

1041
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,300
then you can use your Facebook or

1042
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,670
Twitter you know API is to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,920

a d as in traditional Active Directory

1045
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,920
stuff now let me ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question Jim</font>

1046
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:41,130

1050
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:55,500
but if you want it if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore</font>

1051
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,180
your own if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your own NDA and</font>

1052
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,400
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inner workings of your</font>

your business buddy I have an India to

1055
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:09,779
myself oh security by obscurity works

1056
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,070
really well Jim I have a contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1057
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,670
I'm gonna honor it because I'm a man<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1058
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrity like unlike late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little air</font>

1059
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:20,130
oh let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1060
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,750
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having an act directory</font>

1061
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,220
server that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually log into</font>

1062
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,810
they require you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually be</font>

1063
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,490
physically present in the office between

1064
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,680
nine and five and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then their website</font>

1065
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,910
goes down so since he won't say anything

1066
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,160
let's just assume you have the worst

1067
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,200
authentication ever right and so again

1068
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,240
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send a Microsoft</font>

1069
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,609
product the question is does identity

1070
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,500
work and like and it should we have

1071
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,870
repositories of some sort of identity

1072
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,850
well yeah we should have federated

1073
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,529
identity we mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> open ID is actually</font>

1074
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:49,380
used even<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of the whipping boy</font>

1075
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:51,930
use ldap what open no but we don't

1076
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,840
defend the ldap it's a issue that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ella</font>

1077
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,310
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually make me pull</font>

1078
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,350
the question on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> by pocket yeah l</font>

1079
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">deposition example I wasn't an example</font>

1080
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:04,910
was that specific technology internal

1081
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,840
off identity models AKA like ad and

1082
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,270
traditionally turn so we're talking

1083
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using it in the cloud yes like</font>

1084
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're what would normally work in your</font>

1085
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,670
traditional company before cloud held

1086
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,140
your identity descent work now so I'm

1087
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

1088
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,940
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using ldap and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ad in the cloud and</font>

1089
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,740
good luck supporting your you know 500

1090
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,170
users but with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us who have to</font>

1091
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,819
support like a million users we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1092
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different and that's</font>

1093
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a reality again I think I think the</font>

1094
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,850
point was it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> AK ldap as an</font>

1095
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,589
example is what he says he stated so

1096
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,810
it's not necessarily ldap even though

1097
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,880
that like ad has 80 Federation services

1098
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:40,020
that you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the you know ad FS</font>

1099
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,820
so it's not necessary that the

1100
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,380
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is what we debating i</font>

1101
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,600
am sure that's about how I Bobby's

1102
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed Twitter's and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Salesforce the</font>

1103
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,779
world who deal with millions of

1104
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,490
concurrent customers I'm sure they're

1105
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,740
racing to use ad for those customers

1106
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:55,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just doesn't work that way these</font>

1107
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:58,259
technologies don't scale for cloud level

1108
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,480
needs they just don't they use something

1109
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,240
else so if you want to use ad for your

1110
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,470
100 or 500 customers you go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

1111
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,129
it's not going to work at true scale

1112
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:11,250
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Federation version of AD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

1113
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:13,350
its limits again Jim I hate to bring

1114
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,530
this back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you it's not ad that we're</font>

1115
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:18,540
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so it is an example</font>

1116
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,790
that he stated that is actually part of

1117
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm from from a</font>

1118
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,320
run on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 that as much as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a third</font>

1119
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:30,870
language so probably not understanding

1120
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:32,670
the question here but I yes whoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1121
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:35,460
it's time for voting we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had enough of</font>
