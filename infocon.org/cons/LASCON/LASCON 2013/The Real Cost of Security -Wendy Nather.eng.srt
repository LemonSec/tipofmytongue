<font color="#CCCCCC">was one branch of the 451 group we do a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of stuff including we have our</font>

we acquired<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yankee Group who you've</font>

00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:49,330
probably heard of either this year or

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,420
last year I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember they</font>

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,519
cover mostly mobility these days and

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,950
underneath 451 research we cover pretty

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,570
much everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what we call the</font>

power all the way up to layer or layer 9

16
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:13,030
maybe so I wrote a paper this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is long</font>

17
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:16,539
paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was I pulled a bunch</font>

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,180
of security professionals people we know

19
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:23,740
and love in the community and I had this

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:26,319
question to ask them I'm a nuisance

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,259
though in a 1000 person enterprise that

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,910
has never done security<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I have a</font>

23
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:32,440
blank check now I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this never</font>

24
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,810
happens in real life but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

25
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,910
rid of the financial considerations and

26
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a consultant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

27
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:44,080
me what<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy and you would not believe</font>

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,580
the range<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reactions that I got just</font>

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,239
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question I got a lot of</font>

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,380
suspicion one person said oh this would

31
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,599
never happen that's a ridiculous

32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,190
situation as a matter of fact that's

33
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what happened to me when I</font>

34
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,020
started at the Texas Education Agency on

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,849
my first day I was the only security

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,090
person and they said we need your<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget</font>

37
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:06,759
request by the end of business today so

38
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,410
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really does happen and I still have</font>

39
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,119
people calling me consultants who say

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,280
i'm working with a new client they've

41
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,379
never done security<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gotta make a list</font>

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them of what they need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy so</font>

43
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,640
they can budget for it tell me you know

44
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,410
can you help me make a list so this

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,290
really does happen and it happens all

46
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,859
the time one of my favorite reactions

47
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:28,480
was this one I hate this survey because

48
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,580
it assumes that everyone and everything

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,239
is the same and it asked me for an

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,460
exhaustive

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,050
list I can't possibly provide and I will

52
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,970
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three-quarters of what</font>

53
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,670
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about and there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way I</font>

54
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,410
can answer it this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> none other</font>

55
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,940
than somebody we know and love Nick

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,810
Selby who was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very first</font>

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,180
research director of the enterprise

58
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,680
security practice at four or five one he

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,950
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one who convinced me to become</font>

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,620
an analyst he's a crappy guy as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

61
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't hold back but you</font>

62
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,300
have to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ask yourself why was he</font>

63
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:04,480
so annoyed I sent him this in writing

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,940
you know it did he not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have google yeah</font>

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,500
why was this so hard I was not on stage

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,380
with him holding a Taser to his butt

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,820
saying you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a list right now</font>

68
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:19,180
why did this annoy him so much why is

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:22,540
this so hard here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another reaction</font>

70
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,790
that I got now I got all sorts of things

71
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">there were some people who suggested</font>

72
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,440
buying a few is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for different</font>

73
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,609
technologies and one person recommended

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,410
as many as 31 separate technologies now

75
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,300
you can tell but this person<font color="#CCCCCC"> was from a</font>

76
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really rich organization and they could</font>

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:44,020
afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy one of everything and they</font>

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,510
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> did everybody's response reflected</font>

79
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,580
their experience where they were what

80
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,739
they were used to so this one said

81
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,680
before i bought anything i would invest

82
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,570
in a BSA and engage a security

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,730
management program for at least a year

84
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,859
and I'm thinking oh this is great you

85
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,380
know we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a program going and we</font>

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,230
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any firewalls up it for</font>

87
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,700
a year how is this supposed to work but

88
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,920
it turned that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person is</font>

89
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,230
actually somebody who sells these sort

90
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,480
of services so that's lens that they

91
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,750
were looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and so I thought well</font>

92
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,269
you know it takes all all kinds there

93
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,579
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person who</font>

94
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,960
responded and said in our organization

95
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,390
we have as many as 50 different

96
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,919
technologies but we really only make use

97
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,349
of four of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so you can imagine just</font>

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,820
how despair it this is it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

99
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,100
know in the military and financial

100
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">services they can afford</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy one of</font>

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,910
everything and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually do in fact</font>

102
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:45,490
if I had a dollar for every vendor that

103
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,980
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> boa hat was a customer bank of</font>

104

<font color="#CCCCCC">america i could stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this for a</font>

105
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,940
living bank of america buys everything

106
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,830
where they're apparently a large

107
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,900
financial institution that everybody

108
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,200
talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the one that has you know</font>

109
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:04,030
tried some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their stuff so it's a huge</font>

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,500
huge range so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

111
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,270
people did answer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,580
emphasize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've not prompt anybody</font>

113
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,010
this this was not multiple choice this

114
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,380
was a completely open question and I cuz

115
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to see what people would say</font>

116
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,100
what they would write down what they

117
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,380
would call it in what order you know

118
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,150
some some of them prioritize them some

119
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,210
didn't some did of you know

120
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">stream-of-consciousness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of list but</font>

121
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,630
this is these are the ones that came out

122
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:33,700
the most often out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the blue</font>

listed that technology in some form or

another and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I have some what would</font>

know bare minimum out of what they

129
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,890
see despite everybody saying that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bee</font>

130
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,200
and firewalls don't work very well

131
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,360
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> listed eighty and firewalls</font>

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,479
those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most commonly listed</font>

133
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,230
technologies and why is this it's

134
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,120
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot not recommend AV &</font>

135
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,280
firewalls you can't say oh no you don't

136
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">need them leave them out nobody does</font>

137
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,640
that if somebody does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come see me</font>

138
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,900
after class because I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> love to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with you about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and IPS now you</font>

140
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,429
can see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some divergence here</font>

141
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,909
between them listening and saying that

142
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,190
it's absolutely necessary so<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs IPS</font>

143
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:28,390
kind of not everybody felt it was really

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary general type monitoring about</font>

half and half encryption the same and

146
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:40,710
sim now if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at these does</font>

147
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,160
this remind you of anything exactly so

148
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,010
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> laundering is</font>

149
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,950
general right so using examples of what

150
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,120
maybe they responded<font color="#CCCCCC"> is monetary yeah</font>

151
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,450
sometimes as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said the word</font>

152
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,470
monitoring some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of monitoring</font>

153
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,849
sometimes they were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more</font>

154
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,100
specific and they said application

155
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring or they said network</font>

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring um basically anything that</font>

157
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,119
did not have to do with collecting logs

158
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,100
or they didn't say the word sim but they

159
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,750
but they said the word monitoring in

160
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:20,750
some form or fashion I counted that as

161
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:28,830
monitoring whines isn't policy-based

162
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:32,910
depart-<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found 34 c is or is not</font>

163
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,590
stuff they weren't terribly specific in

164
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,030
specific you know they didn't write out

165
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,159
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different kinds of monitoring</font>

166
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,869
most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just said some</font>

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,960
sort of monitoring or real-time

168
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,900
monitoring or you know we would have a

169
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,859
sock and we would do some monitoring

170
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,900
this is the sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

171
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,460
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> um if they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually they</font>

172
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,960
didn't specify products that they did I

173
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,900
left them out because I did not want

174
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,120
this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be about vendors just about</font>

175
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,979
general technologies the other problem

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,950
is that again maybe you've noticed this

177
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,310
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of the terms that we</font>

178
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,229
were talking about our going away or at

179
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,630
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new proper vendors that I</font>

180
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:15,480
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to most often are running away</font>

181
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,969
from a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these terms they're saying</font>

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,730
yes we're big data analytics we look at

183
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,860
security events but we're not a sin or

184
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,140
they say oh we're not signature-based

185
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,820
antivirus which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a straw man</font>

186
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,390
because nobody uses just signatures

187
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,750
anymore they say you know we we detect

188
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,080
uh you know advanced persistent threats

189
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,969
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked well how is that not</font>

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,370
IDs and IPS they go oh well that's not

191
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:46,440
that's not yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin Mandia gets really</font>

192
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,890
annoyed when I asked why<font color="#E5E5E5"> his indicators</font>

193
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,540
of compromise or not signatures he says

194
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,100
well you know thousands of factors go

195
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,620
into it and I say okay it's a really big

196
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,440
signature

197
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,740
but you know so that all these terms are

198
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,680
actually starting to go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vendors</font>

199
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,030
are distancing themselves from them so

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,180
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what people recommend they</font>

201
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,069
may not be using the same words in the

202
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,959
other thing that we've discovered we

203
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,660
also have a service inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 451</font>

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">research that interviews IT executives</font>

205
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,350
for an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about what they're</font>

206
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,900
buying and why and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another case</font>

207
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,370
where we don't prompt them we ask them

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,100
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you using for application</font>

209
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,980
security and if they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> SharePoint we</font>

210
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,830
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down and what we and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

211
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,170
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the users</font>

212
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,970
out there do not understand the jargon

213
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,069
that we use in security they are

214
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,960
completely confused even<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside of</font>

215
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,640
security people are confused about the

216
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,560
difference between a web application

217
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:49,470
firewall and an application<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware</font>

218
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,880
firewall and so there's so much nebulous

219
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,000
stuff going on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to say</font>

220
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,350
cloudy but that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't even</font>

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what we're talking about half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

222
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time so having said that this is</font>

223
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,310
what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to distill out of the</font>

224
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,090
answers that i got and yes it does look

225
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,400
an awful lot like pci and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

226
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know pci is really not that bad</font>

227
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a standard if you are simply trying</font>

to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something and you need a</font>

229
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,930
list it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great list it's a list</font>

230
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:25,770
question vocation again on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

231
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:30,210
resolution to distance Oliver by another

232
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,310
oh my god what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prevention of that</font>

233
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,840
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's the textured networks</font>

234
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,500
yeah and then one percent of the budget

235
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,560
you spend on right now I know village

236

first barber successfully yeah that's it

238
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,740
that's a really good question in fact

239
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really hate when people say oh</font>

240
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,760
you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending more on detection</font>

241
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,260
and prevention because if I must and so

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,150
and I've started with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> budget that I've</font>

243
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,520
had for a couple of years and I've had

244
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,810
this much on these products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

245
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,180
I'm going to keep them in house<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

246
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:09,660
they're all prevention am I<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

247
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,540
cut down my spending and maybe use fewer

248
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,550
products in order to have money to spend

249
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,650
on per bit on detection or should I just

250
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to you know my boss and</font>

251
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,730
saying I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money now for</font>

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,230
detection you know what is that what is

253
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,820
spending more on detection than

254
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,740
prevention being well we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are detected</font>

255
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,400
change the way our reliance has been

256
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,400
prevention devices that guys are so

257
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,689
girly good that some of the products

258
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,370
offered a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> great example but there</font>

259
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,970
are a lot of solutions are losing their

260
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,980
effectiveness or cost at almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ry how</font>

261
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">much I really benefiting now they were</font>

somebody portage enough presentation a

265
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:01,620
bypass that will connect garmin pocket

266
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,870
yeah i would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> bypass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention will</font>

267
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,210
bypass the prevention will they're

268
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,450
absolutely massive yeah yeah and we'll

269
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,550
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more than so yes everybody</font>

270
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,680
scared a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci but really it was pretty</font>

271
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,750
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> start considering the other answers</font>

272
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,430
that I got here are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next six most</font>

273
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,680
frequently listed ones and you'll

274
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably agree with all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> notes</font>

275
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,620
that application security was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

276
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,290
most um but it was only recommended

277
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,230
about half the time as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the other</font>

278
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,800
ones on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and this was from</font>

279
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,900
again from security professionals why

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,439
would they not list application security

281
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,610
as an absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cease you know some</font>

282
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,760
of them said yes it would be good to

283
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have but it's not a it's not a bear</font>

284
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,520
did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for promise and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,470
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for technology's not products but</font>

287
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,970
there were people who did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

288
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,480
anything about application security

289
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,980
again these people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I interviewed</font>

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,330
had at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of security under</font>

291
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,560
their belts there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

292
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know and respect in the</font>

293
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,969
community if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

294
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">application security where does this</font>

295
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave us especially for people who don't</font>

296
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what they're supposed to buy web</font>

297
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,829
security this is more along the lines of

298
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:23,990
web filtering stop any people from going

299
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:26,150
to bad sites dlp was just but nobody

300
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,680
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> gops necessary they listed it but</font>

301
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,040
they said no this is not this is not

302
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,900
really necessary Application Firewall of

303
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,370
some kind XML firewall laughs you know

304
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,470
anything else identity and access

305
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,200
management these were all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that</font>

306
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,870
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nationals frequently</font>

307
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,160
listed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked people well how</font>

308
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:50,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">many people do you think it would take</font>

309
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,339
to run us and again this is for a 1000

310
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,609
person organization because I had to do

311
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,080
some scoping around it and again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

312
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of people said well I can't tell you</font>

313
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,610
what to buy until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell me more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

314
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,280
the organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I said well try</font>

315
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,980
anyway you know tell me something give

316
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">me something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so you know one person</font>

317
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,280
said you know hire one person and give

318
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,780
them a whole bunch of open source

319
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:19,189
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel really sorry for that</font>

320
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,530
person really really sorry yeah yeah

321
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,140
exactly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember when I when I</font>

322
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,360
started in my job I was the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

323
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,870
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be fair we did have people</font>

324
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,080
who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing firewall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> II stuff outside</font>

325
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,990
of security um somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> said i could</font>

326
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,950
easily over work 12 people and again

327
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,530
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA at a 1000 person</font>

328
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,560
organization now strangely enough five

329
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,689
years later when I left he EA I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

330
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,099
direct reports and I had another team of

331
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was working on an i am</font>

332
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,660
project for me so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of you</font>

333
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,430
know growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to where</font>

334
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:59,120
you kind of feel like you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a</font>

335
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:01,359
handle on stuff one person decided to

336
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,550
say that it would be you took like I

337
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know twenty fifteen or twenty</font>

338
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,050
percent of you know the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

339
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">employees and that would be the number</font>

340
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,349
of security people you should have and

341
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,920
they ended up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 I thought now that</font>

342
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:18,140
was ridiculous so again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

343
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,839
much dependent on what your experiences

344
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what you plan to do what you think</font>

345
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,060
you can do and what you can afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

346
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything else that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> listed in</font>

347
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:33,619
some in some form or fashion at least

348
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:35,449
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe not more than once um you</font>

349
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,420
know some of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very you know</font>

350
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,730
new or fancy stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and usually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

351
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,250
people who listed more technologies got

352
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:47,030
around to listing these nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes</font>

353
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,850
snack almost nobody likes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that although</font>

354
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:56,150
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are seeing a resurgence of it</font>

355
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:58,340
especially being driven by BYOD and then

356
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,770
I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> them where did you get this list</font>

357
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,620
from what where did you drive this from

358
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:08,360
based on what and most of them said

359
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:11,090
experience some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them did say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nist pci</font>

360
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,420
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sans but just about everybody</font>

361
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,160
the majority just said experience they

362
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:22,099
just kind of know it's just conventional

363
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,020
wisdom well you know who knows you know

364
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,330
it's if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a seasoned professional</font>

365
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,090
you go well I I just know that everybody

366
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,460
needs you know prevention technologies

367
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,950
and you need some sort of detection you

368
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,740
need to imagine figurations across your

369
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,420
enterprise you know you can come up with

370
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,460
a basic one but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just what you've</font>

371
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">already seen working what you've already</font>

372
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">used um we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any hard evidence</font>

373
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,780
to show whether any of those things

374
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:53,450
actually worse it's very much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

375
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shaymin is thicknesses are this is our</font>

376
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,720
feeling this is our conventional wisdom

377
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,819
this is what everybody says you ought to

378
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,480
have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can see how it makes sense so</font>

379
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,790
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it's just some</font>

380
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of magic incantation that we live</font>

381
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:17,030
and we do it from experience a competent

382
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:18,680
confident oh no no I didn't and then I

383
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them what else would change the</font>

384
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,150
recommendation if they knew other things

385
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot of</font>

386
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">these make sense the type of business</font>

387
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,570
everybody said type of business

388
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,950
regulatory requirements was another

389
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,810
really big one but again that's

390
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,360
compliance that's not for effective

391
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,070
security but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's another threat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

392
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
they have to manage to the threat of the

393
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,399
auditor versus you know the threat of

394
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,260
the hacker the budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> and revenue a lot</font>

395
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,880
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were very pragmatic depends on</font>

396
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,050
how much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have that's how much</font>

397
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">security you buy you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and sadly this</font>

398
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:57,260
is this is what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and data type</font>

399
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and classification only a few people</font>

400
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,879
actually mention that which I thought

401
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,040
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty funny it doesn't really</font>

402
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,650
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of data you have it</font>

403
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,629
matters<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know more what the regular</font>

404
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:13,550
is could have say to you what they say

405
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you need to have yep geographic</font>

406
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:23,750
location um dispersion for example yeah

407
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,520
go tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the people in Singapore</font>

408
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,950
they're also very cranky in Singapore

409
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,639
they tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take over your servers once</font>

410
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,770
you put them there so you know

411
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,720
geographically dispersed you know when

412
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,610
you have a lot of branch offices

413
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,560
franchises you know all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

414
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,810
obviously will affect what you recommend

415
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,350
for security<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is by how</font>

416
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,450
much you know isn't something across the

417
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,850
board if everybody needs to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

418
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,040
their logs shouldn't we be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

419
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,409
know say across the board everybody

420
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,379
needs log management isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

421
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should be able to say</font>

422
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,580
so then i took that the most commonly

423
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned once and i went to vendors and</font>

424
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,230
i asked how much would it cost for me to

425
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,660
buy this for you for a 1000 person

426
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,730
enterprise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got the same reaction</font>

427
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,980
we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly tell you how much this</font>

428
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,130
costs until you tell us more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

429
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,700
the enterprise and now notice I did not

430
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,980
go to companies and say what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

431
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,560
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this because a lot of times they</font>

432
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,910
work out discounts or you know they're

433
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,500
all sorts of factors that go into how

434
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,150
much they actually ended up paying for

435
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have just muddied the</font>

436
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,440
waters so I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors and said</font>

437
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,960
you know I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy this today how</font>

438
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,910
much is this going to cost me and i

439
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,650
would say i would sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would call</font>

440
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know openly and say you know I'm an</font>

441
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,540
analyst I'm looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sometimes I</font>

442
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,360
would say you know I would chat with

443
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,700
their with their representative online

444
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,610
and I would pretend to be a person who's

445
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,220
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make out a budget and you know</font>

446
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,830
so i got these answers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't alone</font>

447
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,930
would not give me answers and so I did

448
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:03,850
what I could with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data but you can</font>

449
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:05,770
see the variation in here the low 113

450
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,080
three the high is<font color="#E5E5E5"> four hundred and</font>

451
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventy-five thousand dollars if you</font>

452
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,960
spent the top end of whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able</font>

453
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to price and then I took the average if</font>

454
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,690
you think I should have done the median

455
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,969
see me after class I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

456
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's what significance doing an</font>

457
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,600
average as opposed to a median as

458
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,970
opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> any other slice of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

459
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,300
but if you have a good idea you know I'm

460
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:35,560
all ears there's no way that average is

461
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:38,470
probably the low well it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

462
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,050
talked to ms ESPYs I talked to box

463
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,270
vendors I talked to vendors who sold

464
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,159
these things as a SAS and actually all

465
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,010
the prices were pretty much the same

466
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,870
across the board those vendors all pay

467
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,879
attention to each other the prices they

468
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,889
knew who they're competing against and

469
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,870
they tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get parity with their</font>

470
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,510
pricing

471
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:02,050
it's much more stable like the hyatt

472
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:07,030
half the highest yeah it tastes like let

473
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:08,830
them put a billion-dollar anomaly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

474
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,780
yeah well it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you what</font>

475
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,990
you classifies configuration management

476
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,879
and enterprise license with you know GRC

477
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,140
and bells and whistles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

478
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're configuring your whole enterprise</font>

479
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,160
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget which product that was but I</font>

480
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,180
wouldn't say which gender it was anyways

481
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,950
but you know of these you know huge

482
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,360
monolithic sort of things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

483
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,950
from a large vendor and you get an

484
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,020
enterprise license and it's you know

485
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:42,640
half a million dollars we've all seen

486
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">knows yeah no no absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was one</font>

487
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,550
where I was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get prices out</font>

488
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,709
of a lot of vendors in some cases I had

489
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,440
where the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

490
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,809
commoditized they often already have the

491
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,700
price up on the website so it was easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

492
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:58,990
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to that so if it's more</font>

493
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,030
commoditized they will tell you the

494
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,090
price if it isn't they keep it a

495
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,980
well-guarded secret and so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font>

496
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,230
that I got here I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aggregate I</font>

497
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,000
could not I cannot tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font>

498
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,450
individual vendors because I promised I

499
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,510
wouldn't so what's the bottom line here

500
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that if you hired one</font>

501
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,690
person and again I took a sample i think

502
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,928
i took the average salary from a survey

503
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,309
that somebody had done of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sis</font>

504
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:30,700
security professionals<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it was</font>

505
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:33,100
like 90 92 thousand dollars a year and

506
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,920
added all the HR costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto it if you</font>

507
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,870
hired one person and all open source

508
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,330
software this is how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would have</font>

509
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:43,689
to budget for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 person</font>

510
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,439
enterprise if you did more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a a</font>

511
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,590
middle-of-the-road thing or the highest

512
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,990
plus a SAT for 90 min 212 but a staff of

513
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:59,559
four that's almost 1.5 million dollars

514
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,270
all of this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're the</font>

515
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">porsa so who's sitting there with an</font>

516
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Excel spreadsheet and you're trying to</font>

517
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,720
budget for what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for security</font>

518
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,400
you could be off by as much as a factor

519
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:18,520
of four or five

520
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:20,740
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty scary so it is really</font>

521
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,010
really scaring the question is how much

522
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be affordable for an</font>

523
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">entity of a thousand people you know I</font>

524
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,740
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you consider a thousand</font>

525
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,480
employee enterprise to be small medium

526
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,900
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on who you talk to but can</font>

527
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:39,610
they afford one and a half million can

528
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,950
they afford 225,000 it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

529
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">said the day when I came in to t EA and</font>

530
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,330
they said we need your<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget by the end</font>

531
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,310
of the day I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put in like a two</font>

532
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,159
thousand dollar budget I I asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

533
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,350
logging server in a couple of books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

534
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,400
the person I was reporting to scribbled

535
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,310
it all out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said where do you think</font>

536
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,490
you are the private sector of and so I

537
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:03,040
had a budget of zero when I started and

538
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I know that there are other I had a have</font>

539
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:08,110
had other colleagues in this city<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

540
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,700
have started out with zero budget and

541
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,780
often stayed that way for a couple of

542
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,450
years so<font color="#E5E5E5"> two hundred and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-five</font>

543
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,370
thousand dollars I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

544
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,550
laughed out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agency if I had</font>

545
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

546
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:27,040
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it would have cost so</font>

547
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,560
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may hate pci but</font>

548
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,500
at least it is a very concrete very

549
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,740
prescriptive list of technologies it

550
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,510
tells you when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're done and as a</font>

551
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,320
result we're seeing that used as

552
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:43,590
shorthand for other<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas for example ms</font>

553
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,189
SPS tell us that they are getting

554
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:49,689
requests for<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci type bundles from their</font>

555
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,820
customers because their customers don't

556
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,410
know what to ask for and they say you

557
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,669
know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they don't have to comply</font>

558
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,230
with it they say well this looks pretty

559
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">good this is a good list it's got</font>

560
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:04,200
reporting sure we'll take that so this

561
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:07,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how pci is become shorthand for a</font>

562
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,730
required level of security and so that

563
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,770
really ought to scare you because we all

564
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not enough but it's the</font>

565
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,540
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we have so if we're going to</font>

566
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,519
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this better what are we supposed to</font>

567
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:23,979
do with this how are we going to make it

568
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,809
um so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

569
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:29,979
something where we need to come together

570
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:32,469
as an industry and figure this out open

571
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:35,169
source plus staff might work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in some</font>

572
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:37,899
cases it's actually cheaper in South

573
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,809
America for example they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

574
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,189
services economy so that services are

575
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,589
very very cheap there are a lot cheaper

576
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,449
than products so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more open</font>

577
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:48,698
source use there with a lot more

578
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:51,699
consultants behind it we have the

579
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:53,409
opposite thing here talent is very

580
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:55,349
expensive it's very hard to get it's

581
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:58,599
hard to tell when you've gotten it if

582
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:59,678
you you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have somebody in</font>

583
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,668
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that you're interviewing</font>

584
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,149
what are you going to do it you're going

585
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:05,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask them for their cissp how are you</font>

586
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:08,018
going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are hiring the</font>

587
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:10,359
right security talent even as a security

588
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:13,629
person I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when I talk to</font>

589
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:16,749
somebody I know you know who what I have

590
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:18,519
in who I'm talking to but somebody who

591
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:20,079
is in small<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise who knows nothing</font>

592
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,690
about security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to know this</font>

593
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,428
they're gonna go for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cissp because</font>

594
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:30,309
they've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know this is the</font>

595
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:32,289
easiest thing to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it um so you</font>

596
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,690
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could be too expensive</font>

597
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:37,179
even the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source thing could be too</font>

598
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,609
expensive i can't see one person trying

599
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,499
to run all seven technologies that

600
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:45,279
somebody would need is a bare minimum I

601
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:47,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">just can't see it so you know two three</font>

602
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,659
four people you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> running it or maybe</font>

603
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,549
doing it time slicing it you know you

604
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:53,679
have a half an FTE here and a half an

605
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:56,199
FTE here which is really good for

606
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,629
reading logs because you love it when

607
00:26:56,199 --> 00:27:00,069
somebody who has five other job has to

608
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:03,099
take it kind of try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read logs it's</font>

609
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:05,769
never going to happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

610
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:07,989
need a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of dedicated mind</font>

611
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:10,809
chair to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on security if</font>

612
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:13,119
you don't have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these technologies</font>

613
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:17,499
going to do you any good if you can't

614
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:20,829
use them properly so we'll msse save us

615
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:24,759
maybe maybe and their rms SPS that

616
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:26,019
specialize in smaller enterprises where

617
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,399
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say you know we don't know</font>

618
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">what to do we don't know what we need</font>

619
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:31,149
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hand this over to</font>

620
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:33,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell us if we need to do</font>

621
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:36,218
something give us a call if we're owned

622
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:44,489
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them end up having to</font>

623
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:46,839
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know yeah yeah yeah</font>

624
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:49,299
again it depends i talked with smaller

625
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">MSSP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two are cheaper and it depends on</font>

626
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,549
what site type of services you get these

627
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:58,659
things do not come automatically you

628
00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:00,639
know with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a with a SAS but it may be</font>

629
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:03,759
that it will be easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these smaller</font>

630
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:06,580
companies just to you know move

631
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,469
everything over to an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider for</font>

632
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,149
example rather than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

633
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:11,979
somebody who understands how to secure

634
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:15,218
email in their environment a lot of

635
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:17,379
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and I I believe that</font>

636
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:19,599
we're and we are actually seeing this

637
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:23,259
that most of the migration to the cloud

638
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,210
is based on very granular very well

639
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,149
understood non core business functions

640
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,039
like email there isn't too much variance

641
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,418
an email anymore you know exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

642
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to get you know what kind</font>

643
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,830
of security you need around it most of

644
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,469
it having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with not getting viruses</font>

645
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,968
and span so a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have moved</font>

646
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:44,469
you know how can we move their stuff to

647
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:46,509
the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> gmails right there HR is</font>

648
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:48,519
moving to the cloud accounting if you

649
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:51,719
count adp you know we've had business

650
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:55,960
process outsourcing on that for decades

651
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:57,999
we're seeing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of customer</font>

652
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,549
relationship management salesforce com

653
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:03,070
is huge it's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> future by the day</font>

654
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:05,918
again it's well understood you don't

655
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,269
need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of variation people it's you</font>

656
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,460
know people have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write their</font>

657
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:11,200
own but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad idea they don't</font>

658
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to it's easy for them to move over</font>

659
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to Salesforce so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going</font>

660
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,549
how we're going to see these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

661
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:22,418
hopefully with a SAS they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

662
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:25,869
solid security set in the stack already

663
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:28,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully I know that's not a given but</font>

664
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:30,939
most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end end users that I</font>

665
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:32,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to generally feel that if they're</font>

666
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,149
if it's a SAS they generally have a

667
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,849
pretty good security model all the way

668
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:39,908
down that's what they're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

669
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:41,678
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they feel I don't know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

670
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:43,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">snake left I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

671
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">many of these he tested</font>

672
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:47,739
to find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many SAS providers are</font>

673
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:49,389
really secure but that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that</font>

674
00:29:47,739 --> 00:29:51,299
could be the only way to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

675
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:54,519
them trying to secure what they

676
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:56,769
currently have for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times when</font>

677
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,539
we put a bigger company right you can go

678
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:00,369
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to sacrifice if I get with the</font>

679
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:01,599
prize some of it is yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been</font>

680
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,369
several times when you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

681
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">power source at some place where the</font>

682
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,918
back end is pretty portable and like

683
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:10,629
when they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you anything it's</font>

684
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,080
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they is that it's a bad</font>

685
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:16,238
structure it's really have no idea how

686
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:23,228
many works yeah this is just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

687
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:24,340
do you leave it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad but there's</font>

688
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:26,409
all that we've seen words like you

689
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,639
summer break regular business<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

690
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,019
summer terrible but if you're small

691
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough that you can't do it yourself</font>

692
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:34,090
like you can well they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

693
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,609
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're asking for today exactly</font>

694
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,379
you can't evaluate it and you can't fix

695
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:40,330
what you have because generally if you

696
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:42,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a smaller enterprise and you have</font>

697
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,009
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few IT resources you've got a whole</font>

698
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:46,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of dynamics going on there so that</font>

699
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,399
even lowering the price on something is

700
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,739
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to help you you know you're</font>

701
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,389
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have antiquated legacy</font>

702
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:55,929
equipment it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running by</font>

703
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:57,549
your CEOs cousin Bob or it's run by a

704
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,950
third party and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no control over</font>

705
00:30:57,549 --> 00:31:02,799
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they say oh we'll fix it if you</font>

706
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,070
pay us so you know there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

707
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,349
of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply cannot do</font>

708
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,489
you know examples of if you only have a

709
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:11,080
few servers you're going to pile

710
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:13,809
everything on to them until they can't

711
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,619
run anymore and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly opposite</font>

712
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:21,908
to segregation of duties or network

713
00:31:17,619 --> 00:31:24,279
segmentation or anything so maybe ms

714
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:26,259
ESPYs is the way if we can work out a

715
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:29,619
model that's sustainable and affordable

716
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:32,470
and vetted that you know actually works

717
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:34,678
or we move everybody to SAS things that

718
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:38,409
have again that have been vetted

719

can along marketing sales passionate so

754
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,620
I've seen the whole spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the job</font>

755
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,090
robots and the marketing sales and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

756
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,909
reason why a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people are using</font>

757
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,770
some of the vocabulary is because it

758
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,870
doesn't work I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

759
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,580
product called shelf wear whatever

760
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,909
that does not work and does a disservice

761
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:45,580
and you can go to a trade show or places

762
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:48,100
and your movies trying to learn what to

763
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,260
use and there's a lot of marketing this

764
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,610
don't have them and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

765
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:56,730
some senses to do with the service and

766
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:59,500
then I think your minimalist approach

767
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,390
has a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because then these</font>

769
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,650
don't work I think that's that's them

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:07,809
you'll have you'll harm is using things

<font color="#E5E5E5">does these act like one of the question</font>

839
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,400
I just said they've never done security

848
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,130
goal was something to make the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

849
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,740
shop it's like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've said no money</font>

850
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:36,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

851
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:38,279
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to the end of that blows up</font>

852
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,859
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wire cutters that's not</font>

853
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,300
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to say we're trying to</font>

854
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,720
say like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much money do i need to</font>

855
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,100
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure my company is</font>

856
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,129
compliant know how much is<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

857
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,350
security I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even qualify what what</font>

858
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,960
the end goal was<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

859
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,029
criteria I I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to lose things</font>

860
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,790
until they stopped until they felt it

861
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,990
was enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know these again</font>

862
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,910
these are people we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and love</font>

863
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,810
who are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well respected in</font>

864
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,609
the community a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

865
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we'll all</font>

866
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,660
due respect I think if it were<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easy</font>

867
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,310
everybody would be doing it by now I

868
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,920
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's anyone reference</font>

869
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,500
architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're there you know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talent behind the project Ardra</font>

871
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,650

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a box and B how to exploit</font>

876
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,190
will do I said you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you have town</font>

00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,660
you got about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need talent and</font>

878
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,240
it's been at least my experience that

879
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,520
for any given security problem let's say

880
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,129
detection that you have in an enterprise

881
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,869
part of it is the problem itself you

882
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">will have the same problem no matter you</font>

883
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:53,280
know it's a theoretical part of the

884
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,140
problem a much bigger portion of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

885
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,660
the environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which you're having</font>

886
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,430
that problem because there's so many

887
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,170
constraints on what you're having to do

888
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,690
what technology you're trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

889
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,140
with what technology you have the

890
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,580
political climate the people the culture

891
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,740
you know whether things are outsourcing

892
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:13,560
and you not under your control all these

893
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,240
sort of things contribute to the context

894
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,500
of the problem and then there's a small

895
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,330
portion that's you know maybe you're

896
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,330
just not doing it right thank you
