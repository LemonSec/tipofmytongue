16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,869
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk I'll talk a little</font>

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,050
bit you know kind of what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning</font>

18
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,700
point was for me personally in all this

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,100
getting involved with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cavalry and</font>

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,039
talk a little bit about secondly are

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,899
insecure lives and and how that connects

22
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,850
with the cavalry message and some of the

23
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:30,890
uncomfortable experimentation that we're

24
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:34,030
doing so the turning point here for me

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,440
personally I I turned 35 this year and

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:39,080
yeah I know that's not like super old

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,030
yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i made it i managed to</font>

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:46,039
live this long it screwed up yet at

29
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not in a terminal way but plenty</font>

30
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:53,590
of time yeah so but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I really</font>

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,220
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what if what was</font>

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,380
i doing what am i doing what does it

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was think you know what I do</font>

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,780
is important so I help people secure

35
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,939
things you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">be many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you will give to your bank or</font>

37
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,440
to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help that</font>

38
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,350
organization protect that so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,540
doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> breached I do a lot of work</font>

40
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,660
important work to try and keep that

41
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,549
information safe and ensure that

42
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies are breached and if they are</font>

43
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,870
breached help them get out of it but

44
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,750
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about it is what I do</font>

45
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,459
actually import so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all fair</font>

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,709
and good but you know what does that

47
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,980
mean at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day you know</font>

48
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,890
these are bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data floating around</font>

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,250
there's there's a certain I would say

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,069
lack of tactile feedback when you're

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,170
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with information security and in</font>

52
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,119
terms of what I do in the overall scope

53
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,190
of the world thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about personally</font>

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something i can say the end</font>

55
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,030
of the day yeah you know I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,829
people PCI DSS compliant that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,200
so you know pluses and minuses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

58
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,140
just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this actually in the</font>

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,119
ramp up to this talk that Nick and Josh

60
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,649
gave a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON about this cavalry and the</font>

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,910
cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea that the Cavalry's and</font>

62
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,430
coming which we'll talk about in a

63
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,170
second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to be thinking more</font>

64
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,530
about what does it mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you say</font>

65
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,858
something's important and Nick and Josh

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,720
both had personal stories about how they

67
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,940
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of similar realizations about</font>

68
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,560
the work that we're doing and whether

69
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,739
we're touching the right things whether

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,260
we're getting important point across<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

71
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,299
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the important things</font>

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they talked about that actually</font>

73
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,220
resonated with me pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so you</font>

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,480
know body mind and soul so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

75
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,190
things they go beyond just you know

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,160
saving people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from credit card breaches</font>

77
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,960
or making sure that they're you know

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,970
mobile device management

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,680
illusions are managed appropriately when

80
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,440
you start talking in these terms it

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,180
really sets a different contacts for the

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,540
type of work that we do so what do these

83
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,920
things mean so let's talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these a</font>

84
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit and we'll talk about our</font>

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,329
insecure lives as they exist today and

86
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,489
how they may exist it probably will is

87
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,230
this going<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward and let's talk about</font>

88
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,190
the body so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need my body is</font>

89
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,589
we're talking about human life so you've

90
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,450
talked about importance of things in a

91
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,390
human life versus what I mean what's

92
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,270
what could be more important and so josh

93
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,430
has this<font color="#E5E5E5"> great slide about information</font>

94
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,260
and replace ability and security and

95
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,950
replace ability so you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

96
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,349
securing things like credit card numbers

97
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's sad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got breached but you</font>

98
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,160
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a new credit card number very</font>

99
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,010
easily if there's something thats

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,170
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human life security and</font>

101
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,930
somebody dies as a result or somebody

102
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,940
seriously injured you can't undo that by

103
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling your bank right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you can't</font>

104
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,300
say I please like to not have that

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">injury thank you and at episodes were a</font>

106
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,200
really good framework for thinking about

107
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,020
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we working on in our day to day</font>

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,229
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how does it impact and what were</font>

109
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,000
you know how is what we're securing

110
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,860
important or not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's talk about</font>

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,900
human life versus digital life for a

112
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,420
second so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked a little bit or a</font>

113
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,460
lot about actually which browser is most

114
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,170
secure right oh there's this bone

115
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,330
there's these bugs there's this bug

116
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,300
bounty you know which of these is the

117
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,280
most secure but some of the questions

118
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,700
that we haven't been asking enough of

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,469
you know which car is most secure when's

120
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last time you saw comparison of</font>

121
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,150
which car is least likely to get hacked

122
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,510
through its you know tire pressure

123
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,250
system rly resulting in an accident I

124
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's stuff that really matters</font>

125
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,900
you get in your car every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day you get in</font>

126
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,840
your car with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your kids why are we not</font>

127
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,719
talking about that stuff more which

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,940
insulin pump is more secure so this one

129
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,850
actually caught me by surprise

130
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,860
you know I the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEF CON talk i J</font>

131
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Radcliffe also had to talk about this</font>

132
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,520
the fact that medical device

133
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,960
manufacturers are putting things like

134
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,400
Bluetooth<font color="#E5E5E5"> stacks inside insulin pumps</font>

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,520
you know i'm sure you guys saw be the

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,979
article about the pacemaker Dick Cheney

137
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,080
had and how he disabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wireless</font>

138
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,210
thing you know what why is that they

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,890
have wireless to begin with but more

140
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,690
importantly as a consumer if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into</font>

141
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">my doctor and they're like okay I need</font>

142
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,320
an insulin pump I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn</font>

143
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,030
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ask him like I would for a</font>

144
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,280
browser well are you going to install

145
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,770
you know the chrome equivalents<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

146
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,320
insulin pumps or you can install the you

147
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,080
know ie6 equivalent of insulin pumps

148
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,240
right so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are important questions</font>

149
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,570
that matter for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and they not they</font>

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,000
matter for human life and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

151
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,950
going a little bit more forward these

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,750
are questions we may be asking the next

153
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,300
year so next 2-3 years which

154

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,000
have IP addresses they're actually our

160
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,440
refrigerators right now that do have IP

174
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:34,240
these questions will becoming more and

175
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,369
more important as we start plugging

176
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,719
everything that we touch everything in

177
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:42,189
our homes into the internet so its body

178
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,740
so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the mind a little</font>

179
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,509
bit so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about mine we talked</font>

180
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,069
about the freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> to research the</font>

181
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,649
freedom to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do right</font>

182
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,289
now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a bit of our sanity right</font>

183
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy but I think a</font>

184
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,808
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of us are so here's an important</font>

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,219
question you know am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i a hacker what</font>

186
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,849
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what does that mean to</font>

187
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:08,319
you does it mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're fraudsters</font>

188
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:10,719
come right these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

189
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,669
media is you know raising in my mind I

190
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,080
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not fraudster spam but</font>

191
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,779
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to self-identify as</font>

192
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,899
a hacker and all that negative media

193
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:22,089
publicity leading to things like this I

194
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't if you sit you guys saw this court</font>

195
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,259
case it came out a little bit of a

196
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:28,330
little while ago this judgment where you

197
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,159
know the tipping point for the court

198
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,789
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence that the defendants</font>

199
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:36,010
in the own their own words are hackers

200
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,019
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a conclusion that the</font>

201
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,439
court had reached it oh they are they

202
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">must be guilty of these things because</font>

203
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,449
they are hackers they must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know</font>

204
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,180
they must be hiding things they must

205
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:52,990
have this intent which one I thought was

206
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,479
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting so even though it's a</font>

207
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,360
serious privacy violation to take their

208
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,820
computer we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

209
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:05,160
do it can I go to Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in map I</font>

210
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,279
don't know I mean am I losing my ability

211
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,540
to as a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher travel to</font>

212
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,430
certain areas of the world is it

213
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,149
becoming illegal to teach so you see

214
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like this right somebody getting</font>

215
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,730
targeted and prosecuted for teaching how

216
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,089
to beat a polygraph so what's next we

217
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:29,880
teach you how to do sequel injection or

218
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,769
cross-site scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,850
we going to start by putting being put

220
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,760
in jail for those things are being

221
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,190
prosecuted for those things so let's

222
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,529
talk about soul for a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the soul</font>

223
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,350
pillar of this talks about you know

224
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:45,149
voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reason vendor mint neutral</font>

225
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,240
solutions to some of the problems that

226
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers are facing you know how</font>

227
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,600
do you solve a PT right does it involve

228
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,829
scanning all<font color="#E5E5E5"> us traffic for viruses is</font>

229
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,390
that really going to solve a mediator

230
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:00,269
these are things that policymakers have

231
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,449
considered you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

232
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,550
a PT be gone by vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> X you know that</font>

233
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:09,540
it's told the policymaker that that's

234
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:11,490
the way to go how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you solve IP theft</font>

235
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,339
who's giving advice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

236
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,930
policymakers right is the riaa the best

237
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,190
person to be giving advice on how to

238
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:22,109
solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP theft not really right you know</font>

239
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,760
so klin<font color="#CCCCCC"> pepo we see that stuff happening</font>

240
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,580
and thankfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a strong</font>

241
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,740
industry reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those</font>

242
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,220
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far why did</font>

243
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:34,100
it get that far and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it you</font>

244
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,770
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron swartz jail you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for 35</font>

245
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,530
years for downloading journal articles

246
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:45,199
um you know stealing journal articles

247
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:46,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">right this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us how</font>

248
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,170
do you solve hacking what are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

249
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that the Computer Fraud and</font>

250
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,589
Abuse Act ridiculous sentences for the

251
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,930
smallest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so if I go to your</font>

252
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,170
website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see you have ID equals one</font>

253
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,910
and I change that to ID equals two then

254
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe I do it really fast all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way up</font>

255
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,810
to a thousand does that mean I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font>

256
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,810
to jail<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what I've just done does</font>

257
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,979
that make sense some of the other

258
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,810
solutions they've been talked about

259
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,320
requiring a license for an internet

260
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,209
connection for to browse the web is that

261
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,540
an appropriate solution these are things

262
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,980
that are being talked about so yeah this

263
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,990
is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of doom and gloom stuff</font>

264
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,190
but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I personally was</font>

265
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,590
thinking well somebody's probably

266
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:31,010
working on that's right i mean there

267
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:34,220
must be top men out there addressing our

268
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,470
top problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I mean doesn't the</font>

269
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,850
FDA don't they have a role<font color="#CCCCCC"> in medical</font>

270
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,380
domain isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get something</font>

271
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the FDA why aren't they looking</font>

272
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,840
at this stuff or are they automobile

273
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,880
manufacturers they have all these safety

274
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,460
standards and the manufacturers

275
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,800
themselves have to adhere to them aren't

276
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,260
they looking in the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

277
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,189
adding these new features to automobiles

278
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:01,250
we have these other organizations that

279
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,750
should say isaca and I C squared<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcl you</font>

280
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:06,590
I mean there's other people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

281
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:10,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain aren't they working on these</font>

282
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:12,470
problems well so the question that would

283
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,470
ask back are things getting better as a

284
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">result of that as a result of everything</font>

285
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,320
that we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in security in the</font>

286
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
past 20

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,740
things getting better for us our

288
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,709
manufacturers getting smarter right so

289
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,780
here we see Billy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rios into a fist</font>

290
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:34,250
research showing that there are

291
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:35,630
hard-coded passwords affecting 300

292
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,710
medical devices and these are things

293
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like baby incubators and pacemakers and</font>

294
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:46,310
insulin pumps and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> recent so I</font>

295
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,199
mean what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how could this be</font>

296
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and then as I mentioned</font>

297
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,460
remotely controlled insulin pumps why is

298
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,120
that a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea and whose thought to</font>

299
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:03,650
not secure those is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media getting</font>

300
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,470
smarter right are they really are they

301
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,770
reaching out to people like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this look at</font>

302
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,450
the world's number one hacker you know

303
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,810
look them up this is not who should be

304
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:19,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">on CNN representing us our politicians</font>

305
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,380
getting smarter right so a lot of talk

306
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the Obamacare site and how you</font>

307
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,510
know couldn't handle 100 concurrent

308
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,800
users but does that really give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

309
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,110
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comfort from a security</font>

310
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,180
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so the site is</font>

311
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,370
missing basic functionality or can't

312
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,020
complete transactions do you think they

313
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,700
had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to invest in the</font>

314
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,810
security of that solution did the

315
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,220
politicians do their due diligence in

316
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,699
terms of looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see whether that</font>

317
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:51,260
those companies had had previous bad

318
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,700
history with security lapses and so but

319
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,860
the thought is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay someone will come</font>

320
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,540
before it's too late right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we</font>

321
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,490
don't see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people driving around</font>

322
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,709
crashing into trees because they're

323
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,750
there bluetooth or whatever their car

324
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:07,790
was hacked so somebody's got to come

325
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:11,270
right somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming ok so the</font>

326
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">cavalry isn't coming is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the news so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> news</font>

327
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">flash there isn't there aren't people</font>

328
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,860
out there doing this for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us it's up to</font>

329
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">us so it's up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in this room</font>

330
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and whoever we can talk to to start</font>

331
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at these problems that affect</font>

332
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,500
our lives are

333
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,130
in human life our body our mind and our

334
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,790
soul so we can look at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

335
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,339
say okay we can make excuses for why we

336
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,270
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that oh you know we have a day</font>

337
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:42,470
job<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X it's too big of a problem</font>

338
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,930
this is really not something that we

339
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:50,000
have a skill to do or we can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

340
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:52,099
progress on us so trying to make

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,270
progress what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like you</font>

342
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,010
know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before are we going</font>

343
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,360
to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the same things or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

344
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,420
we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to do things differently</font>

345
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:02,630
so let's talk about uncomfortable

346
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:06,649
experimentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jim is looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:10,790
hmm no I haven't done bad as what you

348
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:12,350
were saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

349
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean leeds doing things in a different</font>

350
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,550
way in touching topics that we haven't

351
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">really addressed as much as we could so</font>

352
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,319
the one of the ideas is you know let's

353
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:24,260
organize for action what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

354
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,149
so if you look at other industries you

355
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,029
look at the American<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bar Association you</font>

356
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:31,010
look at the American<font color="#CCCCCC"> Medical Association</font>

357
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:35,060
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have right where is our voice</font>

358
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:37,550
where's our common wisdom being shared

359
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">with people that they want to know you</font>

360
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">know politicians that may want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

361
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,550
what's the right thing to do or media

362
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,979
people that want to know what is there

363
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is the reality of the situation so</font>

364
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,620
uncomfortable experimentation so could

365
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:56,480
we do good through targeted research<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

366
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,180
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

367
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,430
so we have these areas like medical

368
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,650
devices like automobiles acting where we

369
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,390
have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> people working on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but as a</font>

370
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,890
group if we decide that those are areas

371
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,410
that are important to us for our

372
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,670
personal safety and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> family's safety</font>

373
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,260
what if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that hey</font>

374
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,089
you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

375
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,689
proactively getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of people</font>

376
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,980
together to work on these things getting

377
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,630
the right message out what if we

378
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in front of the ball</font>

379
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:28,500
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start looking at how do we how</font>

380
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:32,189
do we have the media how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use their</font>

381
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,590
system and use the media but this time

382
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,300
Terry the correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> message or a factually</font>

383
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,900
based message or one that's not

384
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:43,770
completely disparaging to our community

385
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,590
and could we change or prevent bad cyber

386
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,420
security laws from even starting to be

387
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,850
thought about in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place by</font>

388
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,050
giving advice vid that's actually sound

389
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,600
and it's not vendor dependent then the

390
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,630
next question becomes should we and so

391
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

392
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">this will never work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're techies</font>

393
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,460
we're not safety people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

394
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,450
that background we're not PR people we

395
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,210
don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to the media</font>

396
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not attorneys we don't know how to</font>

397
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,660
get help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know laws are made you</font>

398
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,930
didn't watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> that video in first grade</font>

399
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,540
or whatever the other idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

400
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,640
screw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them right they made their bad day</font>

401
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,010
line we told them we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font>

402
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,690
them but they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

403
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,020
what they get they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these insecure</font>

404
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:32,880
cars they give these insecure pacemakers

405
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,639
the problems are too<font color="#E5E5E5"> large right the</font>

406
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">world was lost a long time ago it's too</font>

407
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">late now the balls been set in motion</font>

408
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,629
companies are used to doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in a</font>

409
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,500
certain way and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much for</font>

410
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,500
us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to take on</font>

411
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,780
okay so yeah this mentality right which

412
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,670
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot of us we see</font>

413
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,500
it we joke about it that were you know

414
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sarcastic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group or we're a</font>

415
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,640
skeptical group so here's what I upload

416
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say back for that is never doubt</font>

417
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,980
that a group of thoughtful committed

418
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,290
people to change the world and I like

419
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:19,210
this fiery got gene came up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

420
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:23,139
face HD more so the thought is you know

421
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,390
okay look nobody's working on this we

422
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,750
get enough smart people together we get

423
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,730
us together right it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing</font>

424
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever has changed the world so how</font>

425
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:37,000
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we turn this thing around so what</font>

426
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,210
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we done so far on this so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,130
lot of talk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know a lot of I</font>

428
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,830
think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people are getting the</font>

429
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,870
message so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward so</font>

430
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,030
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a lot of all contacts we've</font>

431
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,320
talked a lot on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter we have a Google</font>

432
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Group that we've set up and we've talked</font>

433
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,450
a lot about these issues and we decided

434
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that no hay the next step is we need to</font>

435
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,490
get together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in person and start hashing</font>

436
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,760
some things out so that happened to do

437
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:07,270
recon 2013 we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first meeting so</font>

438
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,280
September 28 and 29 we add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

439
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus that were involved in these</font>

440
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,559
conversations we had enough flip charts

441
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,730
we had enough deodorant a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

442
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,139
to Dave Kennedy in his group the dirty

443
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,840
group for allowing us to have these

444
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,630
rooms for two full days to work through

445
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,790
these things so we had a lot of great

446
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,740
people involved that helped lead the

447
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:30,320
conversation as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as providing</font>

448
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,730
expertise at certain key points so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

449
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,879
essentially had different rounds of

450
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:37,910
going through these questions so we

451
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about in what conditions exist</font>

452
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,600
that we don't like so I brought up a

453
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,490
bunch here so far about things that

454
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect our health things that affect our</font>

455
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,480
mind and our soul and talking as a group

456
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,090
about what else are people seeing out

457
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,100
there it really shouldn't be happening

458
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the causes of</font>

459
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,549
those conditions so why are those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

460
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,770
happening why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think those things</font>

461
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,150
are happening the<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface level why do</font>

462
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,010
we what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root causes of</font>

463
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,929
those are and then what should be done

464
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,090
to eliminate those causes so what do we

465
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,890
think this solutions can be how do we

466
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">eliminate the cause of the problem so</font>

467
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,510
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't happen so these are</font>

468
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,280
the areas that we looked at so we looked

469
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:16,100
at medical which I talked a lot about we

470
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,230
looked at automobile we looked at media

471
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the portrayal of hackers in the</font>

472
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,260
media we talked about law and what's

473
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,450
going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that area and we had some</font>

474
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,950
great discussions for those three

475
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,510
questions essentially went through each

476
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those areas over two days and</font>

477
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,070
generated a ton of output kind of

478
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,410
interesting stuff so some of the

479
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,450
outcomes of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still you know</font>

480
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,580
a ton of knowledge sharing about what's

481
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,860
going on out there these experts in

482
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,080
these areas talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest</font>

483
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's going on with medical devices and</font>

484
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,418
autos and media and cars are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the log</font>

485
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,740
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good information that that</font>

486
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,610
people in the room were getting up to

487
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,250
speed on tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas so you know I</font>

488
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,870
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the facilitator group</font>

489
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,070
we've talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot before and</font>

490
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,360
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter he thought okay we're</font>

491
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,678
probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of it a lot</font>

492
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the same stuff but there were some</font>

493
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
really new really creative ideas that

494
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,040
came out of this and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

495
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,200
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of us was we saw more</font>

496
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,809
agreement in differences and that was

497
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,640
really I think for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me personally a bit</font>

498
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,860
of a turning point

499
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,530
because I know that as a group we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

500
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,419
to be part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our job is to tear things</font>

501
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,879
down and see how they work and see how

502
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,980
they they were broken and I think it is

503
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">a group there was a lot of more</font>

504
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,580
constructive positive agreement and it

505
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,080
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also telling that we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all you</font>

506
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,540
know we're thinking similar things about

507
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,870
these ideas so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive to</font>

508
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:44,139
see so what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have still to work on</font>

509
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,810
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we have figuring out our</font>

510
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,090
identity a little bit more so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked</font>

511
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the conditions and what we</font>

512
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,540
think should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done about them though</font>

513
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,360
speak to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mission what do we accept</font>

514
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">exists to do what is our purpose what do</font>

515
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">we believe in what form do we take so</font>

516
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,400
there's been some talk about no are we

517
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:06,430
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 501 C 3 is there going to</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys are seeing what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

567
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,520
of your thoughts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this type of effort</font>

568
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,520
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it better what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

569
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,920
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should watch out for</font>

570
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,740
so kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through this this deck</font>

571
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you a sense for what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

572
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,820
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to accomplish but really</font>

573
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,159
we're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh's here</font>

574
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,800
listening very interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing any</font>

575
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,890
questions you guys have any thoughts

576
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,690
that you have feedback we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

577
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,310
this room for after this talk so if

578
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,760
there's people that want to stay and

579
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:35,510
have additional conversations we're here

580
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,770
I'm here very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to connect with</font>

581
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested in getting</font>

582
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,510
involved so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was have we</font>

583
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,470
thought about combining our efforts with

584
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:47,690
other organizations like a la spin Issa

585
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,400
we have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and some of</font>

586
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,290
the ideas that we had a disturbing on

587
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,910
brainstorm

588
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,980
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a lot of depth</font>

589
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,560
and then those areas and what are the

590
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">areas of synergy and how we can help I</font>

591
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,460
mean if you have ideas or connections

592
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,350
with those organizations or see a way

593
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,460
that that could happen better we

594
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,480
definitely be interested in hearing

595
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,160
about it yeah so the comment was theirs

596
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,290
hackers have kind of a disdain for PR

597
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,030
and media is that is that a

598
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,100
self-fulfilling prophecy that they're

599
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:18,639
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to then report badly on us because</font>

600
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,040
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not we're disdainful down I think</font>

601
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,690
that's an excellent excellent point we

602
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,129
talked some about that at<font color="#E5E5E5"> der beek on it</font>

603
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:29,890
how you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> were we see things that we</font>

604
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,050
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the media and we</font>

605
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,700
automatically assume the best reaction

606
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,520
to that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call them out on it as</font>

607
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,340
opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for being a resource to them</font>

608
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,860
so talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative ways of how</font>

609
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,449
can we be a resource media how can we

610
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,070
educate them better so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ideas</font>

611
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,290
that came out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talked about</font>

612
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,590
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you know what if we had some</font>

613
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,909
type of knowledge project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know with</font>

614
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,449
josh has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

615
00:25:51,910 --> 00:26:00,070
as well where if someone in the media

616
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:02,020
has a article to writing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sequel</font>

617
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,820
injection or a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> molnar ability that</font>

618
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:07,330
could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this and watch a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minute</font>

619
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:10,030
video on this for the layperson for

620
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,280
media folks is what sequel injection is

621
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,660
you know where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what DDoS is</font>

622
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,080
please don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> screw it up in your</font>

623
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,780
articles with the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so but being</font>

624
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,310
constructive may be helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

625
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,780
were some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room</font>

626
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,790
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had experience with media talking</font>

627
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know maybe what we need to do</font>

628
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,450
is give ourselves even some media

629
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,180
training right like if conferences like

630
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,470
this how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we speak to the media what</font>

631
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,470
are they looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

632
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,700
caveats but you need to think about when

633
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,050
talking to them and some of us do it

634
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">really well like I don't</font>

635
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:42,490
as I've seen Dave Kennedy's speaking

636
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,860
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media has spoken to the media</font>

637
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,450
and a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of occasions he connects</font>

638
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,520
very well he gives them what they're

639
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,440
looking for he's also representing as

640
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,139
well so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we replicate that model</font>

641
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,970
do more of those things it's all about

642
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk exposure that's what they base</font>

643
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,340
their premiums on with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their charging</font>

644
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,560
people and they're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

645
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,659
understand that many of their clients

646
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,050
are actually increasing their risk

647
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,910
exposure and they haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

648
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,980
proper ways of measuring it saying you

649
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,100
know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reward you by lowering your</font>

650
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,660
premiums if you do the following things

651
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,610
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with standard ways of saying</font>

652
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a minimal level of responsible</font>

653
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,899
practice either if you're a user we've

654
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,270
cobble together all these capabilities

655
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,460
IT software if you're a developer

656
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,530
providing that to them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

657
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level do care we would expect to see</font>

658
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,510
in that area just on<font color="#CCCCCC"> us so that's in</font>

659
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,550
terms of providing information to

660
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,680
insurance company right as part of these

661
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:37,540
health monitoring and all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other oh</font>

662
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,130
and by the way there's a lot of reports

663
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,230
and like there's other people involved

664
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,750
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the auto industry who've been focused</font>

665
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,880
on doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the the medical device</font>

666
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,350
side there's been several GAO reports

667
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,730
have come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that as well there's</font>

668
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,919
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of recommendations in that area</font>

669
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,170
get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little time yeah I mean</font>

670
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,290
definitely welcome to to hear more about

671
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,810
that I think some of the challenges to

672
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:01,270
that we see is a community is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

673
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:04,000
often enough go out outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

674
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,260
community to connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font>

675
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,390
part of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were talking about at</font>

676
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:11,200
Derby<font color="#CCCCCC"> con is what if we had a directed</font>

677
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:14,920
effort to actually go out into like an

678
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,190
automobile conference right and have a

679
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,770
talk there meet people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that industry</font>

680
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,669
same thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical devices getting</font>

681
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,129
out there and outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our comfort</font>

682
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:28,279
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our echo chamber and actually</font>

683
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:30,709
starting to connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

684
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,679
great you to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

685
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,960
change your actuarial tables so they are

686
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,820
more incentive to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure it is</font>

687
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,440
that the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

688
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,189
objective criteria that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you typically</font>

689
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,869
look at any other actuarial tables and

690
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:47,059
understanding a risk exposure associated

691
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:48,830
with this and there should be you'd like

692
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be able to reward those for doing the</font>

693
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">right things as opposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say well</font>

694
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:54,980
there's all this bad stuff and so

695
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:59,149
actually the way of incentivizing them

696
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,739
is to lower the premiums you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

697
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:04,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">made we can even look at changing laws</font>

698
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:06,049
on capital gains you know we've got tax

699
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,999
incentives we're going green why not tax

700
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:09,999
incentives for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security and</font>

701
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,429
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that though if</font>

702
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:18,289
you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actuary tables in the</font>

703
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance industry when it comes to car</font>

704
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,370
accidents you almost any other

705
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,879
insurance the mathematics behind that

question on there's serve a division of

731
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,760
software engineering called safety

732
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,560
engineering which is typically relegated

733
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,830
to like air traffic control systems and

734
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,629
military stuff my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in some of</font>

735
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,659
those to the critical industries there

736
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:46,210
is laws and compliance issues going on

737
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,610
which while safety and security is not

738
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,590
completely one who won there's enough

739
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,469
similarities that we should be a walk or

740
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:55,810
something from yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's a good</font>

741
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea so there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of regulatory</font>

742
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,919
statutory authorities that go with

safety and the FDA actually came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

744

has helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll use the implantable</font>

medical devices as an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

746
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,370
there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they said that's more</font>

of a security issue to bring it up

willing have statutory authority for

752
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,610
it is therefore not safe you don't need

753
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and have security added to</font>

754
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,560
your authority and this is a clear

<font color="#E5E5E5">example if it's not secure it clearly is</font>

756
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,560
not safe because people could not

757
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,080
because somebody could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in</font>

758
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,460
today's everybody yeah well it's it's

759
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,409
hard for me to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the discussion actually that's</font>

761
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:41,440
the language in the GAO yeah what cool

762
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:45,960
good information any other hey you guys

763
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:48,790
hear me of josh<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike how my real quick</font>

764
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,300
one of the nice threads here that we're

765
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,920
hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the questions is you know</font>

766
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,399
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use a metaphor we know how</font>

767
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:01,410
to maybe look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a new iphone and map</font>

768
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,410
out the architecture so we can jail

escape the sandbox move laterally move

770
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">up move left right one of the exercises</font>

we're doing in each of these web leads

772
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,570
is identifying pre-existing

773

organizations that may be assets or

774
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,970
maybe obstacles because no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one none of</font>

775
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">these are we starting from scratch thank</font>

776
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,830
you yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the next</font>

777
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,840
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of the changing</font>

778
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,669
the image and working on some of the

779
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,370
important issues the hearts and minds

780
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's synergistic so if we start working</font>

781
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,870
on issues that affect human life we

782
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,280
start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on issues that infect our</font>

783
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:39,199
families and our children then there's a

784
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:42,110
it becomes easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do positive media</font>

785
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,730
publicity for our community as well by

786
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,490
the way there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole initiative for</font>

787
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:49,100
it's called stay safe online that's

788
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,480
supported both by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government its</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to push that out into schools it's not</font>

794
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:08,780
who are not it's a good-looking comment

795
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:11,240
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that education does have some</font>

796
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,899
some of them not<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer about somebody</font>

797
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,360
the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i could give you</font>

00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,740
top 10 things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go do and it is not</font>

799
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,550
going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more safe</font>

800
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:24,110
because of how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different tax</font>

801
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,669
the problem is I think that we really

802
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,100
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be focusing on those industries</font>

803
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:31,520
default security not default<font color="#E5E5E5"> unsecure</font>

804
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:34,129
where that is very pervasive and our

805
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,639
industry is he can turn security on all

806
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,530
it is a button that should be enabled by

807
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,200
default and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have work</font>

808
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:45,620
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself unsecured because that</font>

809
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,410
is one hundred percent agree but the

810
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,870
entire industry is doing it wrong right

811
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,570
now entire everyone in the industry has

812
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,479
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pervasive thing what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

813
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,939
get extra security for me so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

814
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">security chief default hey insecure</font>

815
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,510
thank you all for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and I look</font>
