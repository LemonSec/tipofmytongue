1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,330
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk to you about you saw</font>

2
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:25,180
dedication 4 winners and pros I got a

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,619
lot of feedback from the first slide i

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,280
rectified some of this in slag number

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,830
two for it being a password field you

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you actually want to start out and</font>

7
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,730
you know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually happens</font>

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,040
where as developers were like in middle

9
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:44,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of code writing code whatnot you forget</font>

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,040
like simple stuff like this so um you

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,920
know like like I was introduced my name

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,400
is Karthik I I live<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in Austin and</font>

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,810
I'm a senior web software engineer my

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,420
journey is interesting because I started

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,940
off as just a web developer did a lot of

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,340
e-commerce kind of applications add

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,709
national instruments and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,990
started doing a lot of cloud stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,850
fortunate enough to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that team and</font>

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,490
one of the first things we needed was

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,990
you know authentication so I got to

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,330
write a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those modules and look at</font>

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,990
the you know cloud authentication and

24
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,130
authorization and whatnot<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of</font>

25
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,530
this talk comes from like the

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,810
experiences I've had from that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

27
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,520
think i spend like<font color="#E5E5E5"> three like it's been</font>

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,619
about four years now since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been</font>

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,440
looking at this space so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot of</font>

30
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">give up developer thoughts from that</font>

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,780
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to do a quick audience</font>

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,800
survey to understand my audience so if

33
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,090
it's like just humor<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for a second how</font>

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,580
many developers do we have in the

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:49,520
audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a quick show of hands get</font>

36
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:53,030
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devs like devops operations okay</font>

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,030
a few security folks like hardcore

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,970
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's probably half a</font>

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:05,240
nap how about like management<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I don't</font>

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:08,090
know of other stuff other titles<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,840
that's good so it's it's kind of in the

42
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,450
ballpark so my agenda was for developers

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and DevOps folks who actually write a</font>

44
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of code I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about you</font>

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,930
know building good systems for building

46
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,849
good ought systems the security pros you

47
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,319
know give you some developer insights

48
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,298
like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times when I go to</font>

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,640
security conferences I realized like

50
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:31,180
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> koopa like developers don't</font>

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,769
seem to be getting you know our<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,950
and what not and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I kind of want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

53
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,739
and a lot of the tools that are used in

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the field of security are you know the</font>

55
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,080
things that developers don't see but I

56
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,459
kind of want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you guys some</font>

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,310
insight on how we think about some

58
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,790
problems and for management or people in

59
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,230
management who you know need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be who</font>

60
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,579
need like authentication systems or

61
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,510
wherever whatever let's give this

62
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,410
presentation to your dev teams so

63
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,049
there's there's many ways to

64
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,670
authenticate stuff the three like big

65
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,080
ones out there right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours you can</font>

66
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,549
either write your own like let's say you

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,810
have a website you're trying to write

68
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,000
out the not system you can write your

69
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,640
own there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff like</font>

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,459
there's open ID and then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> oo auth</font>

71
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,170
so open ID is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing where you know a</font>

72
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,370
lot of websites used to use this before

73
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,708
where you authenticated something

74
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,530
username password and open ID user name

75
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,840
password and use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that o op is more a</font>

76
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">login with Facebook or whatever but the</font>

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,290
purposes of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation I'm going</font>

78
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk specifically more about writing</font>

79
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,319
your own and not about the other two

80
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,299
open ID is kind of like dying / dead oh

81
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,640
this is actually becoming more popular

82
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,980
just because nobody wants to deal with

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,540
this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually kind of complicated</font>

84
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,760
so nobody wants to deal with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

85
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,269
storing username passwords and you hear

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,910
about leaks like all the time now so the

87
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,870
common perception and all of this is you

88
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,790
know if you talk to somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

89
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,590
management who's willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build our</font>

90
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,820
website they're like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it's</font>

91
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,079
just username password you stored

92
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,790
somewhere and then whenever somebody

93
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,640
comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> you login with that what's the</font>

94
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,820
big deal when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you break it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down there's</font>

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,048
like from I mean you can say you can say

96
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> true or</font>

97
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,620
whatever but when you break<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down it's</font>

98
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,130
like a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different pieces that</font>

99
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,799
come together so there's an API<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

100
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,750
know login logout I prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think of</font>

101
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,728
it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a service</font>

102
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,410
perspective because a lot of the stuff

103
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:25,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do you know it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cloud</font>

104
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,370
hosted cloud enabled so having an API to

105
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,469
get he'll you know your login services

106
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,000
or your session based services is a lot

107
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,430
better that you know having all of that

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,010
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up an application for</font>

109
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,289
example like in Java like having a jar

110
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,780
or whatever there are some work flows

111
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,009
associated with that so you know

112
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,258
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> resets an example and then</font>

113
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,759
user interface like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you actually get</font>

114
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,740
to all of that stuff so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think these</font>

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,020
these slides kind of you know go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

116
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apio login logout</font>

117
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,948
session management blah blah blah you

118
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:58,439
know workflows how how the system

119
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:01,349
actually works and then user interface

120
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:04,110
what the end user actually sees so you

121
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,610
know some details on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that from a high</font>

122
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,669
level design the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I want to</font>

123
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,949
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is because most of the</font>

124
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,979
most of the stuff i<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us kind</font>

125
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:16,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of talks about these pieces so when you</font>

126
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,058
have you know when you when you write

127
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,620
out one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems is typically</font>

128
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:22,439
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data store where your data</font>

129
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,529
is actually stored there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so</font>

130
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,449
there's web services API in order to get

131
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,069
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so like the login logout steps i</font>

132
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,129
talked about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you might have</font>

133
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:35,610
some emails that you send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

134
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:38,819
know password<font color="#E5E5E5"> reset emails or accountant</font>

135
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,969
account what's the word like account

136
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,740
activation emails or things like that

137
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,719
and then there's the applications that

138
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">use it so there's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know like app one</font>

139
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:51,270
will use your AP or your past kind of

140
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,610
web services to talk to your database to

141
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,799
know whether users authenticated<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot</font>

142
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,379
and then it's your end users will you

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,490
know actually talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those applications</font>

144
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,709
so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is behind the</font>

145
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,979
scenes<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you have when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have web</font>

146
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:07,949
services so quick look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data like</font>

147
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,508
what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data is stored in here you</font>

148
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,189
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really straightforward right</font>

149
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,620
there's email it might be a username

150
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,959
email might be the username to begin

151
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,430
with first name last name and password

152
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,580
maybe some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ID that links it to</font>

153
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,139
your database oh I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

154
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,269
thing so every time there's like a

155
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,740
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> light bulb thingy up there the</font>

156
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:28,589
light<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulb thing basically is for</font>

157
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,300
developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's a there's</font>

158
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,759
another thing where it says like keep

159
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,080
calm and or keep calm and hack on or

160
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,839
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those those are for</font>

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,459
security pros so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more of a</font>

162
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,229
developer tip so you want to keep your

163
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,430
authentication data separate from all

164
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,979
the other stuff so you don't want to

165
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,409
cluster let's say you're a part of like

166
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:48,120
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecommerce shop or something like</font>

167
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,519
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to have like all of</font>

168
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,439
your data<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecomme data associated with</font>

169
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,449
your user data in the same table this is

170
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,919
not rocket science I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just if</font>

171
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,800
you ask a DBA is like yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

172
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">normalization</font>

173
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,780
what are you talking about a little

174
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">really straightforward so let's go into</font>

175
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more detail web services so</font>

176
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,690
the goal of web services when you're

177
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,878
doing stuff like login logout section

178
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,830
management is you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your user</font>

179
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,750
credentials as safe as possible in

180
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:19,120
general we want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as safe as</font>

181
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,250
possible but also in transit you want to

182
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,300
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know keep that as safe</font>

183
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,680
as well so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

184
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeper look this is probably the most</font>

185
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated slide I have you have a</font>

186
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:34,150
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an application so let's say</font>

187
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this scenario somebody wants to login</font>

188
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,960
so they have an app that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you</font>

189
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:40,030
know the users interacting with they

190
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,190
send a request to you know a post login

191
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,008
service which has an encoded<font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font>

192
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">password it goes to these web services</font>

193
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,879
behind the scenes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know depending on</font>

194
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,770
whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user name password was like</font>

195
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,330
a good pair it responds with either an

196
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,620
HTTP 200 or 201 with a session<font color="#CCCCCC"> token</font>

197
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,270
some kind of exploration with you know

198
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,400
that session token and maybe a first

199
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,960
name last name so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your application</font>

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,698
you can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hello you know hello</font>

201
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,469
whatever and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like I</font>

202
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,940
typically like to use risk rest based

203
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,759
services for this stuff because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes</font>

204
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:15,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">things really easy but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it can</font>

205
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">be so like so protocol whatever you want</font>

206
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,370
as long as there's like some kind of

207
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:23,319
request and response and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

208
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,849
case of when you have so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time</font>

209
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're past your</font>

210
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">username password the second time</font>

211
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gotten a session token</font>

212
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,829
back you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need to send</font>

213
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,809
that username password over again and

214
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:37,718
you're just validating for that specific

215
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:40,029
set a specific session token so in this

216
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,099
case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have a get request on</font>

217
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,790
login and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> session token that you had</font>

218
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,370
initially and a response of 200 or 201

219
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,529
and a 401 failure if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that token</font>

220
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,690
was invalid since that token expires

221
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,910
like you can you can said whatever kind

222
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,519
of exploration you want on it so let's

223
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,339
save you said like 24 hours then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

224
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,890
know that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> after 24 hours that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

225
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,870
would respond with the 401 and so your

226
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,779
end application would would know whether

227
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,050
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that token that you have is a</font>

228
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,000
good or bad thing

229
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,459
so this helps out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case where</font>

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,899
think the next slide is yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font>

231
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:17,000
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case where you're trying you</font>

232
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:19,190
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand username passwords over the</font>

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,899
wire a lot you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you get a token back</font>

234
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,529
and you're like okay so i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

235
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">token i can use it going forward and a</font>

236
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:28,279
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is based on open ID kind of</font>

237
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,589
works that way but there's a there's a

238
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,839
thing in between so it's like the 323

239
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:34,670
spoke model so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like that</font>

240
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,399
but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only like to be like two</font>

241
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,620
parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only benefit of</font>

242
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,880
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that is you know</font>

243
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,240
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to send</font>

244
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">people's like personal credential</font>

245
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,220
information over the wire all the time

246
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,680
and it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's harder just from</font>

247
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,540
from a hacker perspective it's hard

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,069
business because it's not always there

249
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,459
there's like it's there in the first

250
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">request but not in the ones after a</font>

251
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,319
couple other tips in here don't put this

252
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,120
in the URL so when you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in</font>

253
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're posting it so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,540
put username password in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL mostly</font>

255
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the server logs will catch that</font>

256
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,140
stuff and then so if somebody looks as

257
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,660
your server logs they have like access

258
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,689
to all username passwords or whoever's

259
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,800
logged in you know in that period

260
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,620
session tokens you know again set an

261
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,689
expiration time because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't set</font>

262
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,690
that then<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somebody gets that session</font>

263
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,920
token which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> used a lot they kind of</font>

264
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,839
have attitude to the system again and

265
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most important thing in</font>

266
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,160
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this stuff is great but</font>

267
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,220
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work if you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have HTTP</font>

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,040
because HTTP you know can be sniffed you

269
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,380
want to use HTTPS so kind of put this

270
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:54,290
meme in there you want to stay encrypted

271
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,990
so here you know if we talk to our

272
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,959
friend Joe hacker is like great so you

273
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,630
have an API api's are awesome I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

274
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,219
like group forces thing I can just brute

275
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,470
force the login endpoint I have this

276
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,449
like list of usernames at this list of

277
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,970
passwords I'll just like brute forces

278
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:15,050
and you know kill kill your services

279
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:17,600
right but this is where something like

280
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate-limiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can come into play how</font>

281
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,870
many of y'all went to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zane Lackey</font>

282
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,150
talked yesterday

283
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,870
so a few a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you all in that talk</font>

284
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,230
we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate-limiting</font>

285
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate-limiting is basically where you</font>

286
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,940
know you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of API</font>

287
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,219
it only allows like X number of calls to

288
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,770
that API per minute or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know per hour</font>

289
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,620
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it's it's things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

290
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,370
can set and so let's say you know your

291
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:47,940
login endpoint has you can submit like

292
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 or maybe like 100 logging calls over</font>

293
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,660
the course of five minute that's that's

294
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,270
what you said if it goes to like over

295
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,890
101 or 110 or something like that the

296
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,569
server just responds and say hey you're

297
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,490
asking me this too many times i don't

298
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,170
i'm not sure about this I don't trust

299
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you because typically if you think about</font>

300
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,099
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a user perspective they might</font>

301
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,990
forget the password once twice five

302
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,510
times but like a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it seems</font>

303
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,610
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit fishy so and then so</font>

304
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,260
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> blot to and says okay 45</font>

305
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,050
minutes or 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever that</font>

306
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know don't talk to me and then I</font>

307
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,160
can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you can talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me after</font>

308
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,470
that and there are some strategies so I

309
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,959
put I put a link in here Nick Galbraith

310
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,810
who gave the keynote yesterday he has a

311
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,240
really good article blog post on Andre

312
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">luminex I would check that out some tab</font>

313
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
yachts with it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate-limiting</font>

314
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,010
initially when you implemented it might

315
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,180
be a little bit difficult because

316
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,439
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code that you have to</font>

317
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about especially if you have like</font>

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,589
distributed servers and whatnot it's a

319
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit hard to implement up front</font>

320
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,060
but it's totally recommended and then

321
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,849
usable like in all of your api's as well

322
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:52,589
so take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that session tokens</font>

323
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,730
session tokens let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

324
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for a second when you have you so</font>

325
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,100
everybody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ran function</font>

326
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,959
and the grid function right you don't

327
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,580
want to use like to generate your

328
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,779
session token which is a random<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

329
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,110
you don't want to use something like

330
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">randa quid and but you don't want to do</font>

331
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,750
this because they're not cryptic ripped

332
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:21,779
up glass cryptographic we secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I</font>

333
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:23,370
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> drink some more water and you</font>

334
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:25,800
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them like 128 bits of</font>

335
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,170
greater there's a blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

336
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,459
had this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides but Mozilla</font>

337
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,290
actually has a blog of like

338
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,209
recommendations not vlog but they have

339
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,139
like a article on you know best

340
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,329
practices for like optic

341
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,559
web apps and this is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

342
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:40,748
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pull through there where</font>

343
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,118
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it like 120 128 bits or</font>

344
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:45,009
greater that's all that is saying is you

345
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,480
know it's a really large like randomized

346
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:48,910
token which is also cryptic

347
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,809
cryptographically secure all that does

348
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,100
is it's harder to crack so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

349
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">something random and there's enough</font>

350
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,910
there's enough randomness in it for it

351
00:13:55,989 --> 00:14:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would work for</font>

352
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,579
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beast kind of scenarios so you know</font>

353
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:07,569
we've talked a lot about the stuff right

354
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:10,029
now and I kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give there's</font>

355
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:12,429
some hacks that you can do and some some

356
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,799
of the stuff I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

357
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:17,589
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as developers we</font>

358
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:21,819
make mistakes and it's some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font>

359
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:24,160
is good to just think about you know in

360
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:26,290
order to stop stop you from making

361
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,108
mistakes both stronger systems but also

362
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,790
from the flip side when the security

363
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:33,809
pros are testing applications this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

364
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,429
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can think about so</font>

365
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:40,839
you know so what we talked about so far

366
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:42,610
is we have we have an end point where

367
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,379
you submit your<font color="#CCCCCC"> username password here's</font>

368
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,699
your back possession token then you have

369
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:49,540
the session token that you keep using

370
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,949
for you know 24 hour period right so the

371
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,709
hack here is you know create two

372
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:55,359
accounts this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is hypothetical</font>

373
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:58,508
but you couldn't create your accounts

374
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,639
you know and login so typically

375
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,769
applications dump cookies so take those

376
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,679
cookies and just kind of keep them and

377
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,509
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them and so then you can</font>

378
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,269
then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can try is</font>

379
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:12,279
with one session<font color="#CCCCCC"> token and the other try</font>

380
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,029
to trade them with the emails and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

381
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,269
what happens this is because this is

382
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,160
sometimes it might happen this way and

383
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:23,379
this is a piece of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i that i</font>

384
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,209
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> here where you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know you</font>

385
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:28,059
have get dashboard get you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

386
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,549
dashboard is some kind of page where you

387
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:33,189
say is section valid request cookie for

388
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:35,470
session ID and you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so i get</font>

389
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,789
the section idea of that and then do

390
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">some stuff over here does anyone know</font>

391
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:44,319
does anyone see anything wrong over here

392
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:47,540
or like anything weird that strikes out

393
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:50,490
at you if this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application</font>

394
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you a hint so basically they</font>

395
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,570
they take the session ID and then they

396
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,750
do some stuff and then they get some

397
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,460
more data with you know email and then

398
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,700
display it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

399
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,840
display function and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the actual</font>

400
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:09,930
function that goes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like get</font>

401
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:12,780
processes all of your data what's up yes

402
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:14,880
so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this workflow I mean</font>

403
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,319
logically it's great because you're

404
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at this and you're like is the</font>

405
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,540
session valid hey yeah the session ID is

406
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,339
valid and then it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay go from</font>

407
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,740
the cookies go and take the email and

408
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,540
then give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the data like this case</font>

409
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,600
user compiles for that specific email

410
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,370
and then display right logically it's

411
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,490
great but both you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

412
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that session cookies or the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cookies</font>

413
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,170
for either session ID or email so one of

414
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:43,800
the things you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check here is ok</font>

415
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,860
I got back a session ID is there is the

416
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,630
session ID or is the email that is in

417
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,970
the session ID also the same email that

418
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:54,689
somebody has or somebody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

419
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,040
like submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me so it's one of those</font>

420
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,840
things you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> track of</font>

421
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,130
from a deaf perspective you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

422
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of times you just kind of forget you're</font>

423
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,270
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add here's here's information</font>

424
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,250
piece number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> information piece</font>

425
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,389
number two and you're like put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

426
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,010
together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the app works and then</font>

427
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,720
you're like wait a minute this doesn't

428
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,819
quite work in some of these scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

429
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:17,930
the application becomes open to you

430
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:22,050
hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that make sense yes cool</font>

431
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay session number to make sure that</font>

432
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:26,339
these things actually expired so you

433
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,530
have a log out log out in quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

434
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,000
times when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you write applications we</font>

435
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,590
just and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the logout</font>

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,210
button in the app you click that and

437
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,399
then all that does is you know it clears

438
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,300
your cookies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't actually go</font>

439
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,460
back and tell the server hey all for all

440
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">these tokens or for this specific token</font>

441
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:48,180
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> going expired that so go</font>

442
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,460
and say okay you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know it's</font>

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,470
valid for 24 hours but I'm but the users

444
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,460
told me that he's 16 power that so

445
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,919
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> expire that</font>

446
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,929
so in this case you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you want to</font>

447
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,090
make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you hit log out not</font>

448
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:04,490
only do clear that user cookies at that

449
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,580
part time but also take that session ID

450
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:14,779
and like cleared out so it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

451
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:17,120
in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so let's move on</font>

452
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:20,779
so we have account creation password

453
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,070
reset some over clothes and you know

454
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:23,960
when you're designing<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems out</font>

455
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,418
you know typically you work with a lot

456
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,690
of designers and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is John IV</font>

457
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,970
right and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like big as usability guy</font>

458
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,649
he's like we try and celebrate like

459
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,409
complicated problems but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take</font>

460
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:39,799
this away from the user perspective and

461
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:41,570
make it simple and you know he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

462
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,879
super well respected so a lot of the

463
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,309
usability people on your team will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

464
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,049
like read the stuff they're like okay so

465
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,840
use building<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jack and Jill they'll be</font>

466
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">like okay so you know remembering</font>

467
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,529
passwords is really difficult so instead

468
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,570
of doing like eight character passwords

469
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:58,640
let's just do four it's more usable and

470
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,379
they like what Johnson I'm we said that

471
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,549
you you want to keep this like simple

472
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,309
and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember all this stuff</font>

473
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:06,470
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually happens so like</font>

474
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,320
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you work with usability folks and</font>

475
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:12,399
security folks like it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> disaster</font>

476
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,809
waiting to happen because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

477
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:17,779
place that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from is so very</font>

478
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,940
different so there's no common ground if

479
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:21,380
you all are in a situation like this one

480
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,669
recommendation i have is there's

481
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> book it's called</font>

482
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and usability and it talks</font>

483
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,700
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from both the both of those</font>

484
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,730
perspectives that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

485
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:34,760
check out but the most important thing

486
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,320
from a security point of view is i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

487
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,779
say the you know the days of the four

488
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,178
character password it's like long long

489
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,149
gone does maybe like 2003 we've come a

490
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,460
long way I think and I think your end

491
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,689
users and customers get that now because

492
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,179
when they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they look at</font>

493
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,679
ought systems they're like whoa this is

494
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,419
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's you know the password</font>

495
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,130
strength of this is only four characters

496
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,419
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> negative thing</font>

497
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,370
as opposed to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> positive thing like</font>

498
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,590
before where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you could have a b</font>

499
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,120
c d or whatever but when you're having

500
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,629
these discussions with you york seems

501
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,360
things you want to say is you know hey

502
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know most most good systems out</font>

503
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,719
there today

504
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,639
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> A+ character strengths password</font>

505
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,830
you know in place you can show<font color="#CCCCCC"> them by</font>

506
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:18,559
example and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

507
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,330
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it's weird but you</font>

508
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,100
know instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using just simple words</font>

509
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,980
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and string together just use a</font>

510
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,110
sentence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said to make you know to</font>

511
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,299
make that password character sing so

512
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,729
just some tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

513
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,158
usability teams or people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

514
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,049
organization who might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different</font>

515
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,880
view like don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a security be</font>

516
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,559
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like holistic view</font>

517
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,669
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these are some tips you can use</font>

518
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:46,070
um so let's move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about</font>

519
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:47,570
account creation so typically when you

520
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,639
create an account<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you get some</font>

521
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,629
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the user and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

522
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:56,449
provision the account right so some

523
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:59,059
really basic stuff for both<font color="#E5E5E5"> debs and for</font>

524
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,759
security folks sanitize your inputs

525
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,158
because excess you know it's it's out

526
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,360
there and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

527
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,299
common thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens with</font>

528
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,709
applications when you if you're asking

529
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">for an email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address make sure you</font>

530
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,039
validate that because what's the point

531
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:15,199
of asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some asking for an email</font>

532
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,149
address if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really not going to do</font>

533
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,889
anything with it or you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

534
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,330
validate it because then you know anyone

535
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:22,059
can sign up with anyone else's email

536
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,490
address doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really make sense and</font>

537
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:27,799
there may like in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times when</font>

538
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,840
when I've seen aught systems what I've

539
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,360
seen is there might be like different

540
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,559
data stores like you might store your

541
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,689
credentials in like an ldap system<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

542
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and you might store all of this</font>

543
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">Venn you know in a my sequel database or</font>

544
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,120
something like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have like</font>

545
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,710
different data stores in play one

546
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,189
interesting thing to note here is when

547
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,009
that does happen like occasionally

548
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,419
you'll see you know when you register

549
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:55,580
with like the same email address but

550
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:57,110
have different casing on it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

551
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,928
system might accept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and might send</font>

552
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,750
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like multiple emails you know one</font>

553
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:05,149
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user in like Laura Laura case and</font>

554
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,649
one for it in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> uppercase so make</font>

555
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,908
sure you have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> check in place and if</font>

556
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:10,399
you're testing it make sure you test

557
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,690
both of those scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

558
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:16,570
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> when that happens also weird a</font>

559
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:19,129
really weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw where was</font>

560
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,918
we were storing a lot of this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

561
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,730
ldap and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we were using like ldap</font>

562
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,080
version 2 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

563
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,200
rolled I don't think anybody uses that

564
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,939
anymore but version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 had like troubled</font>

565
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,590
foreign characters you could store it in

566
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,470
there but when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you took it back our</font>

567
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,990
it would be all like garbled so you know

568
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,460
when you register for an account try and

569
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:39,049
use like a Japanese name or something

570
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that or Japanese characters and</font>

571
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:43,280
you'll notice if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice weirdness</font>

572
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,168
then you might you might find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

573
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ldap system what do you do</font>

574
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:51,010
with that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

575
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,010
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but think that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting</font>

576
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,889
passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so storing passwords I</font>

577
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,960
don't know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all are fans of</font>

578
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Macklemore and the thrift shop song but</font>

579
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,549
you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were going to use</font>

580
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,980
passwords and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing you</font>

581
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:11,900
stores clear text passwords then your

582
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,190
management might not be so like so very

583
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:23,090
happy with you come on guys it's okay to

584
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:24,679
laugh but be if you if you flip it

585
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,949
around if you're like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fox</font>

586
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,990
say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox will be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

587
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,700
the thrift shop analogy here that's

588
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible don't do it so best practices</font>

589
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,130
on some of this stuff you know only

590
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">store hashed passwords use use a unique</font>

591
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,570
/ users salt so when you store when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

592
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,059
store a hash password<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go into this</font>

593
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,850
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail but you want to</font>

594
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:51,590
use us you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't just want to hash</font>

595
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,389
it but you also want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a salt when</font>

596
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,189
you have to pass work you also don't

597
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,350
want to use one<font color="#E5E5E5"> salt for all the</font>

598
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,049
passwords in your your data store you

599
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use it for user and then when</font>

600
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:03,250
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> generating your hash you want to</font>

601
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,418
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like bcrypt or a script</font>

602
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,400
those there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

603
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:09,500
computationally intensive but at the

604
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,700
same time think there's it's worthwhile

605
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:16,400
because you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect that</font>

606
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:18,169
data and so you know Joe hacker comes

607
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
along and he's like well that's great

608
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:22,190
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just like get all your cloud</font>

609
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,190
database credentials and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM you're</font>

610
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,929
kind of screwed and some of this you

611
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,220
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a realistic scenario</font>

612
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,549
because a lot of times it's like

613
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,290
LinkedIn for example last year you know

614
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:35,360
they got a list of username passwords

615
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,230
but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the passwords were all</font>

616
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,549
encrypted

617
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:42,290
they still had that list so one of the

618
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,299
interesting techniques that I really

619
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,460
like and I read about I think last year

620
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,168
was uh it's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this company called</font>

621
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,230
storm pad and storm passes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're uh</font>

622
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:53,299
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of in this space but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

623
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,610
the technique that i really liked here

624
00:24:53,299 --> 00:25:00,440
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have you know we have a</font>

625
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:02,659
password hash we have you know we have a

626
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,950
hash and then we have a salt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

627
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,600
like number of times you kind of like

628
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,090
iterating on that to generate that hash

629
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,918
like break that up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> store it into and</font>

630
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,379
put in your different data stores so you

631
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,480
put you put your hash word in one store

632
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,010
put your salt in a different store put

633
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,929
the number of iterations in store number

634
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:22,100
three and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might also want to</font>

635
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:23,630
put like if you if an application is

636
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,540
accessing it you can put them back in

637
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,610
like a different place all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing</font>

638
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,190
is if one of your database<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

639
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:33,409
compromised their the person is not

640
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,970
getting all the different pieces to like

641
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,600
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logic that goes behind</font>

642
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,850
you know how your application is or how

643
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,559
that password might be hashed so it's

644
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,840
it's it's an interesting way of

645
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,160
approaching the same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

646
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,360
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things harder from from a hacker</font>

647
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,590
perspective and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put a whole bunch of</font>

648
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,209
like different things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

649
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,909
things that have you know read in the

650
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,360
past and I just put like a bunch of

651
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:03,350
things in there so let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

652
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,379
reset and restore cool so password reset

653
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,418
so there's there's two camps right a lot

654
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,790
of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have seen</font>

655
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:13,220
before they do a password reset some

656
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,870
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps to you like hey what's your</font>

657
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,580
you know where you're born or something

658
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,178
like that the password restore kind of

659
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:23,178
thing and there's like ideologies behind

660
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:25,640
which thing you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use so I sit in</font>

661
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,080
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password research camp because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

662
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,549
challenge questions that you know

663
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">besides throw at me and they're not</font>

664
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,120
really like challenging anymore because

665
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,610
you might you might be friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

666
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,928
somebody at Facebook or whatever and

667
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,418
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah i</font>

668
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,770
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy's mom mom's name so i can</font>

669
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:41,660
like type that in that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

670
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,950
maiden name hopefully your friends are

671
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,049
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to a queue but you know you</font>

672
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,370
kind of get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point if your data is</font>

673
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really like your personal data</font>

674
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,520
anymore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a little bit more</font>

675
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:55,100
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the society that we live in also but</font>

676
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,080
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do use password reset make sure</font>

677
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the token so a lot of times you'll</font>

678
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,770
get an email right so you'll say

679
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,990
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> reset / some like crazy token</font>

680
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,129
ID and then when you click on that it

681
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,410
takes you to the side where you can

682
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,150
reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> your password make sure that that</font>

683
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,710
token like once it's used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

684
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,250
somebody like resets that password

685
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,320
that's actually expired so it doesn't so

686
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,510
if somebody else got that email later on

687
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,790
they try to reset it or something like

688
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wouldn't work so make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

689
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,850
sure it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like one time only and</font>

690
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,159
expiring super fast so if somebody

691
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,439
doesn't reset a password and say like I

692
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:32,150
don't know 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours like that's not</font>

693
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,590
really valid so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poll so</font>

694
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,090
there's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create an account and</font>

695
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,550
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in this room is</font>

696
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably created accounts before you</font>

697
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:42,230
might have seen two different workflows

698
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:43,970
right so you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you get the page of</font>

699
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the with the forum where you put in some</font>

700
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,410
user credentials then you get an email

701
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,810
and you set up your password and there

702
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,070
might be a different way where you know

703
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,169
you put all your credentials including

704
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,280
your password in there and then you get

705
00:27:54,170 --> 00:28:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the email and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login any thoughts on</font>

706
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,860
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these might be like the</font>

707
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,659
superior way of doing things or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

708
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,780
guys have a preference on one versus the

709
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,780
other

710
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,670
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like method</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number one</font>

711
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:21,610
or way number one all right how many

712
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:25,570
people like we're number two and how

713
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:29,260
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care all okay cool so</font>

714
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,750
turns out that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone who is in</font>

715
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,350
camp number two or don't care this is

716
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:37,240
actually a winner because when when you

717
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this if you think of it the first</font>

718
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,650
scenario where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put information you</font>

719
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,150
go to your email<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for some data or</font>

720
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,830
wait for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emailed come</font>

721
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,750
then you click thing to you know enter

722
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,820
your password it takes a longer amount

723
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,430
of time and so there's a larger user

724
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,439
drop off and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why from a</font>

725
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,820
usability perspective way<font color="#E5E5E5"> number two</font>

726
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,710
wins because you're like put all your

727
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,700
info you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> login to the site yet</font>

728
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,710
because you haven't actually like

729
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,360
verified your email but you're just

730
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:04,240
waiting to get that email to verify and

731
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,919
it takes you to the login page so once

732
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,440
again like the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are strong pap</font>

733
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,970
they actually ran this both ways and

734
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,770
they're like once they switched from one

735
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,930
they switch from the first way to the

736
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,270
second way and they had a 27 I think

737
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:20,200
twenty-seven percent more user

738
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:23,410
completion you use a completion so it's

739
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we designed this at the</font>

740
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:28,180
time we actually we struggled<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

741
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,840
because we were like well this seems

742
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,490
better than this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it it</font>

743
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">just seems like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this seems more secure</font>

744
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,410
and I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also the pain</font>

745
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,910
and like waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an email or like</font>

746
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,890
for it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spam or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

747
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,810
that is a lot higher so most people are

748
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,280
like forget it<font color="#CCCCCC"> iona I don't want to you</font>

749
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:48,220
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the site or I don't want</font>

750
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,230
to register this adderall and that's why

751
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,380
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know this other way might be</font>

752
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,980
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little bit better so final</font>

753
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,570
dots running ahead of time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

754
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing because people want to go to</font>

755
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">lunch is uh I just like I finished my</font>

756
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,960
presentation then I was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

757
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a whole bunch of things I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

758
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,200
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but there's nowhere like</font>

759
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,530
good to put it so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of like</font>

760
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,000
freestyle the last few things over here

761
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:19,180
so oh yes okay so usability coming back

762
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're in a large</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font>

763
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:24,670
and you're the team that owns the login

764
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,080
services and you have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole bunch</font>

765
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like application teams that</font>

766
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,980
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to create these applications</font>

767
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,019
you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they when</font>

768
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,269
they implement a login form they look

769
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:37,000
consistent across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site like a cross</font>

770
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:38,679
our site so like the e-commerce the

771
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,750
ecommerce stuff or the e-commerce

772
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,240
applications and your catalog

773
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,590
applications and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever your</font>

774
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,289
sales applications kind of had the same

775
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,480
login screen because if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't then</font>

776
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:50,620
like from a user perspective it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks a</font>

777
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,080
little bit weird and doesn't seem

778
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,070
consistent and it seems like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

779
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they are trying to work with</font>

780
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:58,899
doesn't have their act together so

781
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,250
that's you know that's kind of that's

782
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,320
something to think about and they

783
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,630
started losing losing trust right so

784
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,240
I'll pick on netflix for a second if you

785
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,070
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their login screens across you</font>

786
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,470
know they I think jason said they have

787
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,580
like a thousand different devices they

788
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,399
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty much the same across</font>

789
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,710
everything so but if you wanted to like

790
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:19,209
login to netflix on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

791
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">the website and it like the login</font>

792
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,720
screens look a little bit different like

793
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,399
one was greeting one was green and one

794
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,230
who's read you'd be like hey what's

795
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,620
going on here is this is this really

796
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">netflix you don't really end up knowing</font>

797
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,678
so that's you know that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

798
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,330
example um yes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shiro if you're</font>

799
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,679
a Java shop and you're you know trying

800
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement some of this login stuff</font>

801
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:42,639
take a look at Apache Shiro it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

802
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:44,370
helps you it's a framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that helps</font>

803
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:46,539
you would like the authentication and

804
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,510
authentication like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a reset and</font>

805
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,860
whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's kind of made for</font>

806
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,658
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication use case like</font>

807
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,000
authentication and authorization as well

808
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:57,820
so take a look that because it might be

809
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it might be of some use for y'all the</font>

810
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,019
SAS version of that is called short path

811
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,889
and storm path has a good blog of you

812
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,940
know just a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tips associated with</font>

813
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:11,529
you know building some some of these

814
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,210
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a two-factor so you know</font>

815
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-factor altec and authentication how</font>

816
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,799
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the audience actually use</font>

817
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:19,959
two factor auth on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google so that's</font>

818
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:22,090
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good number and you know this</font>

819
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">is gaining a lot of traction where it</font>

820
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,918
definitely increases increases the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

821
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,529
security aspect of things where you know

822
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,929
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gmail</font>

823
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:33,399
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local from a laptop or desktop or</font>

824
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,409
some device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you never use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

825
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,479
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this notification on your phone</font>

826
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:38,770
saying hey you're trying to login is

827
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,900
this really you and you know you

828
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,360
you have to punch that number into into

829
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web browser I think that from the</font>

830
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,929
usability perspective it's still kind of

831
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,460
like people are like well but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

832
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:52,750
like asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something via via phone</font>

833
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,130
is the text message actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

834
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,230
across so there's some challenges from

835
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:01,930
that perspective but I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

836
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:05,050
a really good idea and also last I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

837
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:07,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my last final talk but a lot of</font>

838
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,190
a lot of places now have like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in</font>

839
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,719
dashboards you log into like my profile

840
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,990
and there's there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> dashboard</font>

841
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,540
say in there saying hey you last<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

842
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the staff at you know 24 hours ago</font>

843
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">from this location and initially I think</font>

844
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a user point of view people were</font>

845
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:27,280
like well the app knows what I'm doing

846
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,470
you know that used to be how people

847
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,030
would feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the stuff like you know</font>

848
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,880
maybe five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now people like</font>

849
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:36,490
well I want to know if for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some reason I</font>

850
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,100
this app has said that I logged into it

851
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,600
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China or something like that and so</font>

852
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,550
I think the trend is shifting more

853
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,320
towards people wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of</font>

854
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">this information of you know geolocation</font>

855
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,200
timestamp and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from</font>

856
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,270
a developer perspective like we have all

857
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,640
that information with us anyways like

858
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,590
you can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your logs you know</font>

859
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> that request came from and you</font>

860
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:03,159
know what time it came so why not why

861
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:07,260
not show you show the users and yes this

862
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,760
is my last actually my<font color="#CCCCCC"> last slide so</font>

863
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:13,330
Olaf right I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk touch</font>

864
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,980
much on that but a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

865
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,750
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> wood brand new applications you're</font>

866
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,300
like yeah I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my facebook</font>

867
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,800
login for this or twitter login and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

868
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:24,100
know it goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that screen where it's</font>

869
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,570
like hey this app wants to access wants

870
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,299
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your data and write</font>

871
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:31,149
your data one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions like like</font>

872
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:34,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">crypsis over here it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well why</font>

873
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,679
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this need to write to my facebook</font>

874
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,389
account when this is just supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

875
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,399
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know reading about movies</font>

876
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,960
or whatever so think about that because

877
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,969
there's there's been a lot of exploits

878
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,649
on this stuff recently where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know an</font>

879
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,359
application gets hacked and then that

880
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,569
OAuth token goes kind of like wild and

881
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,820
crazy out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open on the open like</font>

882
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,990
you can still take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> away but</font>

883
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,880
they start like fishing for more

884
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:57,160
information and more for your personal

885
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,050
information so kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

886
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more so when you when you</font>

887
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,570
want to find you know whether users

888
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,910
license for a specific you know software

889
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:10,660
package or whatever you can take the

890
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">session token that you get back with you</font>

891
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,190
know when you log into the application

892
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:18,130
take that session token and then link

893
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,870
that potentially to a user ID that links

894
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,850
to do what privileges the user has some

895
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,930
more like the authorization use case so

896
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,299
that's kind of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ways you can</font>

897
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and here's</font>

898
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,200
what you know the different things that

899
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:31,810
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> can access your he or she or you know</font>

900
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,870
that app can access that's one way the

901
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,970
other way is authentication when you

902
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,470
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a lot you can</font>

903
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,740
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up your tokage to have</font>

904
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:44,040
specific privileges and say okay so this

905
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,479
app has the privilege to you know read

906
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,279
you know read this kind of data and then

907
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,960
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like set of privileges yourself</font>

908
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,960
or whatever whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think those use</font>

909
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,620
cases might be you could have multiple

910
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,050
like you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple you know</font>

911
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,710
Samuel tokens or something like one like

912
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:04,810
to that mean different things the other

913
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:08,050
thing the other use case that we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

914
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have where we had API keys but users</font>

915
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,380
could configure what their an API key

916
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,779
was like read only or<font color="#E5E5E5"> write only or</font>

917
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,310
things like that and so you had the

918
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,620
token but then you can kind of configure

919
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,060
what that actually meant and then

920
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,620
there's you know there's there's a whole

921
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,430
different system for that all together

922
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,560
but you once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specific</font>

923
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,000
user name password you can link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hey</font>

924
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you have accessed your tokens now</font>

925
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this token means this thing in</font>

926
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:37,930
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a deal it's not like I don't</font>

927
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's like super elegant but it</font>

928
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,339
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> address there's a lot of</font>

929
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:47,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">different points in there any other</font>

930
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions going once going twice alright</font>

931
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:51,430
well I'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys need me</font>
