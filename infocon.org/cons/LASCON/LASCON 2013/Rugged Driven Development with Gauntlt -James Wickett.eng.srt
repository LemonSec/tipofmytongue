3
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,479
time when it's like you want to drift

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,890
off into sleep and hey I mean there's

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole row chairs over there like</font>

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:35,570
that is totally cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> though there's no</font>

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:38,059
judgment they'll happen there so this is

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be sort of a I kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of changed</font>

9
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:41,660
it to be like more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a hands-on</font>

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,570
workshop class so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have</font>

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:48,500
laptops and be willing to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,690
do some work on it got a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,890
so and if I know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,440
conference so you don't want you know

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,820
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so buddy-buddy pretend</font>

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,620
like it's like a dev conference right so

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,730
like maybe you could pair with somebody

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,260
somebody could take a look at what

19
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're doing if if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool with</font>

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,220
sharing just kind of make some sort of

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,360
gesture to your neighbor to make sure

22
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,590
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the whole point of this</font>

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,910
is like at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like for</font>

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,460
you guys to go to walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with like a</font>

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,110
working you know gauntlet attacks

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,820
directory with some attacks already

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,050
flushed out that you're ready to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and</font>

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could take back into your work like</font>

29
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,710
really I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really</font>

30
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,450
helpful and to be able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

31
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,460
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's that's kind of the</font>

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,960
approach that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow along</font>

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,619
with the slides you can get to the

35
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:35,290
slides at this link<font color="#E5E5E5"> I leave up here for</font>

36
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:37,460
a second on Billy last con dash gauntlet

37
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,080
but there's some other links that will

38
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,548
be in here like I have some github gist

39
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,658
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pull down so you</font>

40
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,350
don't you have to like type up the whole

41
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:50,210
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know grab those and then</font>

42
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:56,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">it would work as well he has got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

43
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:59,059
getting me move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yeah all right okay</font>

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,820
so who am i say i've lived here in

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,920
Austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> I helped start last con in its</font>

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,029
early days and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to see</font>

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,549
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference has grown over the</font>

48
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,600
years help out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps days here in</font>

49
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:14,480
Austin as well and I end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing like</font>

50
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,299
dev ops stuff Ruby I spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time</font>

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,590
writing chef anybody familiar chef

52
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:22,430
that's it yeah so I spend a lot of time

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,040
and in that writing cucumber all that

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,200
kind of stuff and that's kind of it the

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,940
day-to-day world for me well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd kick this off with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little saying</font>

57
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,500
that I've become fond of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lately is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

58
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,760
work like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> captain play like a pirate I</font>

59
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,420
always have to like catch that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

60
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:42,260
say it wrong inversely you know and but

61
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,238
I i like it because it sort of distills

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,798
or helps us think about like okay like

63
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,400
how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to approach this task</font>

64
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,349
and I I think we often approach it in

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,580
the pirate task you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're</font>

66
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,170
always like really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean look at</font>

67
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,910
this conference like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at</font>

68
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,738
having fun right we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> video games and</font>

69
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,030
there's mechanical bull and there's

70
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,110
drinks and there's all sorts of stuff

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going on I think the the security</font>

72
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,640
community is good at the the play part

73
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,200
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're also good at we also</font>

74
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,839
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work like pirates right like</font>

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,970
we're used to taking an advantage of you

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,040
know of trying to do hacking trying to

77
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,069
like work in social engineering trying

78
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,010
to dupe in testing but we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

79
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about like okay what is you know</font>

80
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,260
what does it really mean to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

81
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,000
work like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> captain we're like what do</font>

82
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,608
we do if you were to like take that

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,849
approach and I think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

84
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,709
is gauntlet and and I'll get all like

85
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain like what this is like Khalid is</font>

86
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,590
rugged theology applied and okay so that

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,769
kind of like begs the question like well

88
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,250
what is rugged and is any who's familiar

89
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:53,359
with rugged here God<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so about</font>

90
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:56,510
twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent maybe yeah rugged was</font>

91
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,819
born out of a movement with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh Corman</font>

92
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,470
David Rice jeff williams and they

93
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:01,518
started approaching this and saying all

94
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,639
right well like we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">software that you know it's defensible</font>

96
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,099
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build software that can</font>

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,828
withstand multiple attacks we need to

98
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,410
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> software they can it can resist it</font>

99
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,079
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there's a back in 2010</font>

100
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:21,500
there's a rugged manifesto posted it's a

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,169
on rugged software org and it's real

102
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,789
it's real simple it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar call</font>

103
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,080
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like the agile manifesto some</font>

104
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,330
people were confused like are you saying

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,240
like this is the new agile<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

106
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,740
that's kind of been sorted out but you

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that's how agile started right it's</font>

108
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will stop delivering software in</font>

109
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,360
this crazy process that never involves

110
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,099
our customers it's a similar call out to

111
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,390
the security communities like we will

112
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,880
build software

113
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,580
that can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like stand up to you</font>

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">know more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than just a simple type of</font>

115
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,880
attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of synonyms</font>

116
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,560
with that with with dev ops and I have

117
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,290
what I call like the six hours of rugged

118
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,290
so forgive me for the alliteration there

119
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,700
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think that part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

120
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,230
is like it needs to stuff needs to be

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,180
repeatable you know we often kind of

122
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,620
spent a if you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look at the</font>

123
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,570
history of where we've come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

124
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,390
it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are moving into</font>

125
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,890
this direction and you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

126
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any manual steps we want to</font>

127
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,719
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooked into your CI or continuous</font>

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,810
deployment pipelines I want it to be

129
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,300
reliable so you can't can't das it

130
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:29,540
reviewable so infrastructure is code<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

131
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,890
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's just a good</font>

132
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,350
point to think like all right like we

133
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,940
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to look at our runtime</font>

134
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,680
systems that the customers are actually

135
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,060
using which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that customers</font>

136
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,230
view the world these days I mean we

137
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,160
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you I mean you guys</font>

138
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:45,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it's not you know 1997</font>

139
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,660
people getting DVDs you know in a you

140
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,930
know in a box anymore right nobody wants

141
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:54,140
that and so customers you know what the

142
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,090
software now and and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

143
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,919
not so they're paying for<font color="#E5E5E5"> so with that</font>

144
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,690
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to it's it's not</font>

145
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a shipping software kind of</font>

146
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,440
game anymore right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like actually</font>

147
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,300
building the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and supporting it</font>

148
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,620
in actually having the users interact

149
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,660
with it and like that's the true

150
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,310
experience that's happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

151
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,750
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be rapid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be resilient</font>

152
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,490
reduced and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a there's</font>

153
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,260
a joining factor that like rugged and

154
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,480
DevOps sort of like they're coming at

155
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,890
the same I mean I think DevOps is sort

156
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,960
of looking at it as like okay yet all

157
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,099
these developer and operations and

158
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been separated like what</font>

159
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,640
happens if you you merge those together

160
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start kind of conjoining practices I</font>

161
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,370
think rugged is sort of the same vector

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,800
but like for security and there was a

163
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,680
really you know DevOps is like a hard

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,930
thing to define and people will say some

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,480
people say like DevOps is like a

166
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,280
cultural<font color="#CCCCCC"> movement period right like not</font>

167
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">go any further than that some people say</font>

168
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cultural professional movement</font>

169
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,320
John Willis and Damon Edwards they have

170
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,800
the famous<font color="#E5E5E5"> or honor of its famous but</font>

171
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,960
cams DevOps is about culture ottoman

172
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,560
measurement and sharing that's kind of

173
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,568
become a de facto definition but in 2009

174
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,360
basically what happened was is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed</font>

175
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,099
velocity John all spa and Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> Heyman</font>

176
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,860
got up and they're like we do 10 deploys

177
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,409
a day and everybody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh that's</font>

178
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,789
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy you know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like</font>

179
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,229
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mean you know and they're</font>

180
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,770
like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just push code all day long</font>

181
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,150
and and so there was like an outburst at

182
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,389
that point like how is that possible or

183
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,710
whatever and then you know today let's

184
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">see how far we've come in like a short</font>

185
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,030
amount of time like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason from netflix</font>

186
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:36,500
talking like oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do like you know</font>

187
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,090
200 maybe 500 code pushes the day etsy

188
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,469
guys are talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do like 30-40</font>

189
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,090
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

190
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:42,139
like depends on like your shop kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

191
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,080
where you're where you're at but like

192
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:47,020
that's the the level of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the speed that</font>

193
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,219
people are iterating on stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

194
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,930
also in that deck you know is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey</font>

195
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,129
dev and ops actually have to come

196
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,750
together if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have the</font>

197
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,659
previous slide if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to have that</font>

198
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,960
kind of capacity going on you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

199
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,919
able to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those groups joined and so</font>

200
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,650
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking that and we're saying like</font>

201
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,630
all right well gauntlet the gauntlet

202
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,770
looks at the world and says<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

203
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world is now going in this</font>

204
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,609
continuous delivery continuous

205
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,529
integration viewpoint people are moving

206
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,240
everything that way how do you get

207
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:15,919
security tools inside of the pipeline of

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,349
that and so we're taking we're taking

209
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that approach so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

210
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:21,259
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the value this is what</font>

211
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,300
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools look like today right</font>

212
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:27,770
they're complicated to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill they kind of</font>

213
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,960
fall over easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not exactly sure</font>

214
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,750
what's going on what's connected to what

215
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,458
and you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't hand something like</font>

216
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,828
this off to somebody else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

217
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,718
hey discern the meaning out of this

218
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:42,109
right it would be would be

219
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,570
insurmountable so when building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

220
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,190
gauntlet these are there are some of our

221
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,949
core tenets so we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that God</font>

222
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is a way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facilitate</font>

223
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,699
communication and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe merging</font>

224
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,279
the boundaries between dev and

225
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:56,269
operations and security has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen</font>

226
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,250
and so you kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of start building this</font>

227
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,199
like core language it comes together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

228
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:05,209
we believe gauntlet is trying to be part

229
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:06,890
of that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we have little you know</font>

230
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:10,310
equip so we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the gauntlet</font>

231
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,439
team but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like if you look at the</font>

232
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,280
way we've sort of done thing

233
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,560
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well let me go on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

234
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,120
mini mini side thing here if you look in

235
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,369
like most security organizations right

236
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,840
like a remote sorry most organizations

237
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,550
you maybe you'll have like I don't know

238
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,690
like 100 developers let's just say

239
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,339
you're about a hundred developer shop

240
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,160
and then out of that maybe you'll have

241
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,410
like you know five operations and now

242
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,530
that like you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like one security</font>

243
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,839
person is that have you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that</font>

244
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,189
is that reasonable those ratios more or

245
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">less I mean less you're like working as</font>

246
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,250
a security company than like everybody

247
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,979
is right but that you have that ratio

248
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,170
problem and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the ratio</font>

249
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,670
problem was discovered earlier on with

250
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,310
the dev ops people right<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font>

251
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,430
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody hate the everybody hates</font>

252
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,260
those five guys over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these</font>

253
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,479
hundred people here are pushing all this

254
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,650
code and they're like not testing

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're just deploying and they're just</font>

256
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,430
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the best they can to get</font>

257
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:06,550
stuff out and and it's a complete

258
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,099
disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay scrap that like there are</font>

259
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,079
no you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix is like there</font>

260
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,360
are no more operations folks like you

261
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,900
guys are all one giant team together now

262
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,850
and the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build must also run</font>

263
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,140
and customers must also use it and if

264
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you write the code you have to care</font>

265
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,210
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I believe that shift is</font>

266
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:29,079
like actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the security</font>

267
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,330
realm as well and so we we see that like

268
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,820
over the next you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a bit of time</font>

269
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">here they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will stop being compliance</font>

270
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,570
driven auditor<font color="#E5E5E5"> led security right where</font>

271
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,939
it's like you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just trying to pass</font>

272
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,320
compliance or get the little hacker safe

273
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,760
thing or you know whatever it is right

274
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,930
you're you're actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

275
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,400
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do and</font>

276
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,650
it's you're putting the testing inside

277
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,140
of the build process does that resonate

278
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,920
with anybody like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sound cool</font>

279
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,210
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a one all right and I mean</font>

280
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,880
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's I think that's</font>

281
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,860
ultimately that's where you know I hope

282
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,500
college is part of that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

283
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,940
is the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like where we're going</font>

284
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,430
and so we're building a new language and

285
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,190
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be we're trying to talk</font>

286
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,010
in the currency that actually is spoken

287
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,980
with developers which is tests you know

288
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,980
tests are what what fail or what pass

289
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,270
and and that's that's the currency and

290
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,970
that's the way the people trade between

291
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,579
teams and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work right so we</font>

292
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe so in summary you know gullet is</font>

293
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,650
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

294
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:32,290
Bridge here that connects people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

295
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:35,530
there is a there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great talk on</font>

296
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:38,620
security monitoring at monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> AMA the</font>

297
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,750
EU one is just a few weeks back and I

298
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,300
was like they and he actually had a

299
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,190
whole section on gamma<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like super</font>

300
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,199
flattered about that and I thought well

301
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,330
he described it this way right<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

302
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,310
cucumber<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus security tool integration</font>

303
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,200
so thats that's a pretty fair definition

304
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,780
so I thought I'll steal his slide put it

305
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,250
in here and just say you know that's

306
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,300
that's what we that's what we see is

307
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward gauntlet org is this is</font>

308
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,979
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page you can get to it and you</font>

309
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,990
can start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know we have</font>

310
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,730
our google group on there and some ways

311
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,290
to connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

312
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,820
induce some code here in a second so I'm

313
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,360
just kind of setting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stage here</font>

314
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,800
so on github if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to gauntlet</font>

315
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,060
and it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone with / gauntlet</font>

316
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,680
is our true repo we you know use a suite

317
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,630
of tools we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Travis building</font>

318
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,839
regularly and we have our gym you know

319
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,580
badge and stuff like that and it's real

320
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,180
easy to install gauntlet you know just

321
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,630
do gem install gauntlet we're in Ruby

322
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,969
gems and you'll get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest greatest</font>

323
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,160
ok so the philosophy behind kappa but

324
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the philosophy behind got here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

325
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run tools and repeatable</font>

326
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to read way we're going to try to</font>

327
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,450
handle standard and stare and its

328
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,910
standard out exceptions and try to make

329
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that we handle exit status properly</font>

330
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,400
and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at speed is like speed</font>

331
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,130
and linkage is better than like real

332
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,980
complexity and and doing things like

333
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,480
taking a five hour run job although<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

334
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,300
know gamma will let you run that if you

335
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,100
wanted to or we're looking at that and

336
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,290
we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C gallant as part of the</font>

337
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,880
pipeline and so like as your as you're

338
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">going and you're pushing codes like well</font>

339
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,780
like it nice feel to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooked inside of</font>

340
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,350
your CI<font color="#CCCCCC"> or your continuous deploy</font>

341
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,480
process and also call it doesn't install

342
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,310
your own tools under the hood so you're

343
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have to install those yourself so</font>

344
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:33,640
we we're not package managers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

345
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,290
let's be captains<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah no I know it's</font>

346
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,720
two o'clock but you could like be like

347
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,730
yeah our can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get our</font>

348
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,360
all right good all right I got a full

349
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,279
are that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's uh</font>

350
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,079
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and start with installing</font>

351
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,480
our own tools so you don't have to do

352
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,899
this next step but if you have you have

353
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ruby that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be good but I use our</font>

354
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:57,339
vm i know there's you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

355
00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:00,128
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't like it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's pretty</font>

356
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,899
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use Ruby 193 I</font>

357
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,420
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in here will work</font>

358
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:07,779
with 187 as well but you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

359
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:12,069
better luck with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 193 you know what</font>

360
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:15,160
system you're on all right and so we're

361
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,449
going to start out and who kind of who's

362
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,719
falling along so I can kind of get some

363
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:21,099
visual I got some so if I'm like going

364
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,529
too fast on the slide just be like hey

365
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,389
so I'll back it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and liberal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

366
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:29,050
so you just make a make a last con

367
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:32,170
directory go get in there and then make

368
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,569
a gem file all right who's familiar with

369
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,319
bundle and Jim files and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works</font>

370
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:40,120
one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so basically we're</font>

371
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,259
setting up a gem file and we're going to

372
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">add gauntlet to it then we'll add some</font>

373
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,430
other dependencies we have later but

374
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,480
bundle is really nice because you run it

375
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,769
and then it sets up all your

376
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,800
dependencies and puts a writing your

377
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:51,910
execution or you know right right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

378
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,469
where you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't have to</font>

379
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,439
worry about taking care of any of the

380
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,449
other business along with that so inside

381
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:07,079
of that gem file this is the contents of

382
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:07,079
that as of right now and it's super

383
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,969
give me a thumbs up when you're like

384
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:17,630
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're falling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> along here got one</font>

385
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,960
thumb or an R<font color="#E5E5E5"> and R works okay get</font>

386
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,960
another one

387
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,819
we're good<font color="#CCCCCC"> it got your gemfile you just</font>

388
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,220
got to do is have<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubygems and up there</font>

389
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the top and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just say Jim gullet</font>

390
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,160
and then you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say bundle and</font>

391
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,270
when you run bundle it should look

392
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,270
something like this

393
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

394
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,310
we got bundle going is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

395
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,850
with the internet speed or is it's kind

396
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,849
of slow

397
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,899
alright so let's do gym install a

398
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,519
gauntlet that's so sorry if you didn't

399
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,490
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the bundle part you could</font>

400
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,370
just do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it would probably work</font>

401
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,750
for you I mean it would work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

402
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,529
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can to not manage all your</font>

403
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,570
dependencies with bundle that way

404
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:47,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so future slides are going to be</font>

405
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">using just the word gauntlet just to be</font>

406
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,750
you know short there but you can just

407
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">say bundle exec gauntlet and that's</font>

408
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,810
really what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so whenever you</font>

409
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,990
say bundle exec you're like executing

410
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:02,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">galit in that that context of like the</font>

411
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:06,890
bundle that you just made<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright first</font>

412
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,890
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just touch the example data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tag</font>

413
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,370
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't need to have anything</font>

414
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,079
in there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have like one attack</font>

415
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,280
file if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have an attack file in</font>

416
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,049
the directory you're in like gauntlet

417
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,579
starts like going everywhere to try to

418
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:21,500
figure out like where the attack files

419
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:24,599
are and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it take a little longer</font>

420
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,760
alright so let's walk through what an

421
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,129
example attack would look like in gullet

422
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,320
and it kind of like go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the steps</font>

423
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,640
and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we're going to we're</font>

424
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on three different attack</font>

425
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,370
files that you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

426
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,549
package up for yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font>

427
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:41,129
it later it sort of to give you the

428
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:43,590
framework of how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so let's let's</font>

429
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,320
start in here so the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

430
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:50,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this kind of given win then logic</font>

431
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,790
and this is a single attack file it uses

432
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,580
a the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gherkin language here which is</font>

433
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple given when then and then we</font>

434
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this idea of like a feature and</font>

435
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,580
then a scenario anybody familiar with

436
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,350
cucumber like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one to one</font>

437
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,879
what those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you can think</font>

438
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like a feature can have as many</font>

439
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,559
scenarios as you would like you put this

440
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,540
little background stanza up at the top

441
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,418
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be inherited from all</font>

442
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,830
the below scenarios so each time it runs

443
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,690
and runs its in its own like

444
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,059
independently clean context of each

445
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,970
scenario but that background step will

446
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,950
run and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we're doing here is we're</font>

447
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,980
saying given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in map is installed so</font>

448
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,740
make sure the tool is there and then

449
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,960
given this following profile we have

450
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">this name value little structure that we</font>

451
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> built up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

452
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes inside a gauntlet for that purpose</font>

453
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know fill in</font>

454
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:45,360
fig files or parameterised whatever

455
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,158
you'd like to call in later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

456
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,979
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this just using the real</font>

457
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:53,100
basic in map attacks here so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

458
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,809
launched an nmap attack with in map<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash</font>

459
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">F and then you see this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little hostname</font>

460
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,668
business that is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling out of</font>

461
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,439
the table from up above so it's pulling

462
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,809
down example calm and putting it putting

463
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,190
that in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's checking the</font>

464
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,980
output that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output should contain</font>

465
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,570
port 80 when the output should not

466
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,669
contain later we run the same thing but

467
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also runs it's in the output should</font>

468
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:16,529
not contain 25<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and you could</font>

469
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually probably what you'd want to do</font>

470
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,919
is actually take this then statement

471
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,899
down here and put it up here so you're

472
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,460
not performing multiple you just perform

473
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,139
one in maps can and then do all your

474
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,639
output checking and then move on to your

475
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,559
next scenario which may be like a

476
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:30,928
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of in maps can but here</font>

477
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,720
we're actually doing two of the same in

478
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:37,370
map scans so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font>

479
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,600
like an example purpose that make sense

480
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,989
so here's what it looks like when it

481
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,639
runs with failing attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

482
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,279
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Galah runs I was like well no</font>

483
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:50,428
I was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I trying to find port</font>

484
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,620
443 it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> open so you know I'm</font>

485
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:55,649
calling that a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's what</font>

486
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">it looks like with a with a working so</font>

487
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:59,518
it's just you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just color-coded it's</font>

488
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,019
nice it's like helps you see this and

489
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,389
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing like we're running this</font>

490
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,500
all in the command line and it's you can

491
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:06,000
pipe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and chain this with other</font>

492
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,649
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so as long as like Gamla</font>

493
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,210
runs clean then do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> step in my</font>

494
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:12,959
build process or do whatever it is that

495
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,880
you want to handle next<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now you</font>

496
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,519
now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaalan installed on your</font>

497
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,730
box you can do this gauntlet dash dash

498
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:22,260
list and if you're using bundle you do

499
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,120
bundle exec gauntlet dash dash list

500
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,740
that'll show the current attacks that we

501
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,260
have in there right now so we're what it

502
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,649
ate I've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> others we've been</font>

503
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,000
working on so we have this nice one in

504
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:34,289
here generic which basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll call</font>

505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,880
it to anything on the command line so

506
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:37,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">you write it yourself like that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

507
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're maybe like I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a ruby persona</font>

508
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,279
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know Ruby to know</font>

509
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:42,658
gauntlet so you can just you know write

510
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,190
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python wrappers or whatever it</font>

511
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that you'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to execute and call</font>

512
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,149
that out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the command line and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

513
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,610
works if you notice like some of these

514
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have on here like sequel map you</font>

515
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,149
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a Python</font>

516
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we call out to you right so</font>

517
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,268
the generic thing just sets you up and

518
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:01,149
is able to execute that and pulls in

519
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,769
your output from that let's see what's

520
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,969
pretty interesting well we'll kind of go

521
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:08,769
through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're going to go</font>

522
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,899
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Arachne attack in map and a</font>

523
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:12,220
derby attack so those would be the three

524
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:16,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually look at here in a</font>

525
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:18,309
second gauntlet also has it comes with

526
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,899
these like pre-built steps which are the

527
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,330
pre-built operators of things you can do

528
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:24,609
with garlic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Garlett dash</font>

529
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,399
dash steps it gives you this this big

530
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:28,539
long list and we could probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

531
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:30,219
little bit better job sorting this out

532
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,259
or giving you some you know parameters

533
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,509
as you work through here but let's read

534
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:36,789
through a couple right so it says given

535
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:38,739
whatever is installed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my path</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

536
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,899
very first one it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's for the</font>

537
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:42,039
generic attack adapter so if you were

538
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for something it would say I</font>

539
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,869
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check that that's there you have</font>

540
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:49,029
Arachne curl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Derby and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of goes</font>

541
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:51,699
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this list</font>

542
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:54,730
here which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I launched a whatever</font>

543
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,739
attack right and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have most of these</font>

544
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,149
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little like regex</font>

545
00:21:56,739 --> 00:22:00,989
matching thing in here most of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

546
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:03,639
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay run a sequel map SSL eyes</font>

547
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:05,309
but some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this little</font>

548
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:08,379
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here where it's got the</font>

549
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,999
regex matching<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll talk about that</font>

550
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:13,570
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later but those are attack</font>

551
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:15,220
aliases and so we store<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in the</font>

552
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,570
earlier one you still had they like the

553
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,330
end map example we did where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to</font>

554
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">know like that you know fast in map</font>

555
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,019
attack is like with a capital F well

556
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,119
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to remember that you</font>

557
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:27,340
don't want to memorize that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

558
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,350
thatthat's not like a it's like

559
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,238
something maybe you know a network

560
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,158
person or a security person might know

561
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:36,279
but that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know maybe</font>

562
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,859
a developer or you know wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or</font>

563
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,649
maybe some QA people wouldn't know so

564
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:43,509
it's not super useful so we've started

565
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:45,070
to work down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path of San all right</font>

566
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:47,019
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have attack aliases and</font>

567
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,658
so we're kind of coming up with attacks

568
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:51,820
that are real common and then we're

569
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,230
we're a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lea Singh those two you know tax</font>

570
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,059
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hood that have like a</font>

571
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,230
description with them tell you like the

572
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,908
kind of stuff that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font>

573
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that and so an example that will do</font>

574
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:03,309
later is like a cross-site scripting one

575
00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,908
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know when i launched</font>

576
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:07,789
an arachnid dash

577
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,859
cross-site scripting xss simple attack

578
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,879
you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you don't</font>

579
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:12,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to know anything else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

580
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,059
have to know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Arachne you</font>

581
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,168
don't have to know how to how to you

582
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">know / amortize or anything like that</font>

583
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,369
the little thing will kind of help you

584
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that and hopefully that'll be clear</font>

585
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:23,149
later we've got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other like output</font>

586
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:25,279
parsing things we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML parsing</font>

587
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:26,779
we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things for cookies if</font>

588
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,399
you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curl and trying to</font>

589
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:34,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that your your cookies are</font>

590
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:36,918
working right<font color="#E5E5E5"> or yep so that's that's</font>

591
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,479
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone loaded</font>

592
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,419
just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> gaalan itself is a good way</font>

593
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:43,129
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to use it so if you do</font>

594
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,649
gauntlet dash dash help that kind of

595
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:47,779
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the explanation of how to</font>

596
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:50,268
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we have this other</font>

597
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:51,889
thing in here called all steps and all

598
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:56,629
steps is everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you saw in the</font>

599
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:58,488
previous steps slide but it actually

600
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:00,259
includes all the aruba step definitions

601
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:04,220
and you're like well what is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubra</font>

602
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:06,139
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> aruba is this really cool you know</font>

603
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,149
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to cucumber which does like file</font>

604
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:10,039
operations and like it lets you do

605
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:11,570
output parsing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> regex matching and</font>

606
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,739
all that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're</font>

607
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,359
probably going to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those so</font>

608
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:17,599
we would put those in there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

609
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can list all those out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

610
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,590
let's let's take a look at output

611
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,239
parsing with gauntlet before we start

612
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,009
into our demos here because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

613
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:27,080
output parsing is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that</font>

614
00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:30,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">like kind of gets people hung up at</font>

615
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,389
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they start using it so if you</font>

616
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,379
there's we have a wiki page<font color="#E5E5E5"> that walks</font>

617
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:37,309
through to several different options

618
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:39,498
here it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our github page and from</font>

619
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,499
you know college is on the wiki it's

620
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:43,879
called a pope are seen with gauntlet so

621
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,989
you have these statements like find a

622
00:24:43,879 --> 00:24:47,299
string right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you could say the</font>

623
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:48,889
output should contain the output should

624
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,289
not contain you can do double line

625
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:54,830
matching so like this string is to be on

626
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:56,599
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this string you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also do regex</font>

627
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,099
matching which is a lot a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

628
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,899
useful especially the tools like in map

629
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:01,999
where they like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pat it with spaces and</font>

630
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,599
stuff like you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use that</font>

631
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:08,960
and say I can't read on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my laptop too</font>

632
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:11,539
well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even then the output should</font>

633
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,849
match and you have this little stanza

634
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:16,070
right there and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put an inline</font>

635
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:18,060
you have to do it with these like with

636
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,919
the forward slashes to do

637
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,060
a like what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> regex matching the</font>

638
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,560
only downside of that is you can

639
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,730
actually match a forward slash at that

640
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,080
point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to replace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

641
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">period that's why it's like 80 dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

642
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,889
if you do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-line thing here you</font>

643
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do that because it just assumes</font>

644
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,330
anything that's in this triple quote

645
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,199
statement is you know they getting it

646
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,389
was like that's what it's actually

647
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,490
looking for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense it's a</font>

648
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">little like weird but it I mean just</font>

649
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:48,330
that's it's kind of why I wrote this up

650
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:50,370
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful it can be i gotcha oh so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

651
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,220
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a slide it was a little bit</font>

652
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,169
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see so same thing I was just</font>

653
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,550
saying right in between the slashes if

654
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,220
you want to do it all in one line make

655
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,600
it real simple if you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

656
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,720
match the slash you can do that as well

657
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,929
but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be put in this sort of</font>

658
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,400
stanza okay so this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be our</font>

659
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:10,380
first attack we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a network</font>

660
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,540
attack and we are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a network</font>

661
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,780
attack against vas con org so I'm sure

662
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,510
WordPress won't mind us doing that if

663
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:23,070
you want it's not funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alvin bunny I</font>

664
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:26,280
need to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> better jokes okay okay</font>

665
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go to this URL here at the</font>

666
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,290
bottom gist github com and it'll

667
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,460
actually pull down this file and let's

668
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">just read through this like what we're</font>

669
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,490
going to do so great network that attack

670
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,929
you

671
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,980
you
