00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:26,540
last night it turns out there is such a

3
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,509
thing as too much fun but my name is

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,860
robert hansen<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go by our snake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a</font>

00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,440
director product management of<font color="#CCCCCC"> why had</font>

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">security i used to run a korg wrote a</font>

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,330
bunch of books and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff i've been</font>

8
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:40,459
working in computer security web

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,809
application security specifically and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

10
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,580
really hate saying these numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

11
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:49,309
makes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel old but like 18 19 years</font>

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:51,199
now so the bulk of my wife now but yeah

13
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,910
I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of interesting</font>

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,140
opportunity for me to get in front<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,078
you guys and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,360
little bit different if you saw my talk

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,190
at you said Khan I was you know taking

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,810
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> China of you know if you've seen</font>

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,640
other presentations I've done you know

20
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,660
taking down you know various routers and

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,640
switches and all kinds of crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know as a key know it's a</font>

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting challenge because I get a</font>

24
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">chance to talk to you about some more</font>

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward thinking things or things</font>

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,080
that are I see us making mistakes the

27
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,960
industry so today I'm going to be

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,340
talking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about blind spots</font>

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,500
my goal is to inspire you not to take

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,850
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> you down I know it sort of sounds</font>

31
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be saying oh there's</font>

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,240
bad things about<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore this is</font>

33
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,910
a bad presentation or whatever but

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,580
really am I want you guys walk away from

35
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,050
this feeling empowered like there's an

36
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,110
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix some things that are</font>

37
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,660
wrong about her an industry I don't want

38
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,580
you to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> this too much to heart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,990
get really upset and if the guy next to

40
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,310
you says that he doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any blind</font>

41
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,190
spots at all you can feel free to ignore

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,819
that person because they do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

43
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,350
them I have them everybody has them but

44
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:55,850
but I want you to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opportunity to</font>

45
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,259
be self-reflective you don't necessarily

46
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,699
have to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone what your blind</font>

47
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,819
spots are if you feel uncomfortable with

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,770
that but it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> embrace the things</font>

49
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,090
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and think about how to</font>

50
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,348
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> your knowledge in those spaces</font>

51
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,870
makes us better as an entire industry

52
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:13,790
one of the most influential quotes to me

53
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,430
personally over the years actually came

54
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,859
from dan gear as keynote of source

55
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boston and it gives me a lot of comfort</font>

56
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,400
when I read this only<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this</font>

57
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,650
room will understand what I'm going to

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,209
say it is this security is perhaps the

59
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,690
most difficult intellectual profession

60
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:32,670
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet I think there's times that</font>

61
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,609
I think we can sort of feel very alone

62
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,780
like there's you know there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

63
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,280
people who understand what we're trying

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,960
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> across understand the technology</font>

65
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and I want you</font>

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,080
don't I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want you to feel that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,450
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's enough people even in</font>

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,850
just this audience that you can find a

69
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,220
peer to bounce ideas off of to get

70
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,160
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with to sort of fill the holes</font>

71
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,160
and gaps in your knowledge and possibly

72
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,200
this is the first kind of wave of a new

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,210
sort of beginning as an industry where

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,190
we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about our blind spots</font>

75
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,900
as sort of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage there are way</font>

76
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,680
too open up and talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> people about</font>

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,150
things we don't know so there's six

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,980
blind spots in total that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

79
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,410
be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today that I see us as</font>

80
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,019
in the web application security industry

81
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,720
specifically because because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

82
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:22,080
last con<font color="#CCCCCC"> a things that I think that we</font>

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,210
tend to ignore or miss wholesale that

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,370
tend to be fairly large fairly

85
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,500
influential things that we get wrong so

86
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,760
let's start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this off I know this is</font>

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,310
probably dangerous thing to do first

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,720
thing in the morning because because you

89
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,820
guys are probably a little tired like I

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,550
am stayed a little late drink a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

91
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,709
bit too much wine but I want you to do

92
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,480
an experiment with me I trust promise me

93
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,950
I'm not going to what letting would

94
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,060
steal your wallet or whatever i'm not

95
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,380
going to say your wallet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,630
where your iPad's are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

97
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,620
not worried about it but I want you to

98
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,850
close your eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

99
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,739
experiment with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and only last a</font>

100
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute or two but I think will be</font>

101
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,489
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll be able to take this</font>

102
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,799
with you for the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life so</font>

103
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,010
close your eyes relax and think about a

104
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,940
very dark place a room with nothing in

105
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,980
it very dark empty space now think about

106
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,540
like electrons think about them kind of

107
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,220
flowing through the air moving from

108
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,929
place to place you know free-flowing

109
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,450
electrons going around now think about

110
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,540
them going through wires what must that

111
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,979
look like or what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean</font>

112
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,980
now think about an operating system

113
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,410
think about it sort of being constructed

114
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,810
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how it's sort of maybe</font>

115
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,070
it's talking to things in some way maybe

116
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,150
you don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code means it's</font>

117
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,580
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important don't think don't</font>

118
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">get too bogged down in the weeds now</font>

119
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,609
think about a keyboard when you're

120
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,830
typing things in your keystrokes

121
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,139
something's happening some electrons are

122
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,330
doing something something

123
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">traveling across this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this set of</font>

124
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,340
circuits or whatever now think about

125
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,810
video video cards video drivers what are

126
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,068
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what is that what how</font>

127
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,990
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fit into this picture that</font>

128
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,210
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with now what about Ram</font>

129
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,580
what is ramp what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean to you</font>

130
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,789
what do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means what about IO</font>

131
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,710
what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what is a bus what does</font>

132
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,330
a cpu think about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits into</font>

133
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,198
this architecture what is that thing how

134
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,430
does it fit now think about a network

135
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,569
how it is what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network mean how</font>

136
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,150
are these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things connected to one</font>

137
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,560
another what about threading what is

138
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,169
threading meet in this model that you

139
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,580
just came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with think how do you how</font>

140
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,080
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do threading in this thing how do</font>

141
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,870
our electrons move differently in this

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,758
scenario what about TCP you're making

143
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,050
outbound calls the internet this thing

144
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,099
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP maybe you don't even really</font>

145
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,349

146
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's not relevant just just imagine</font>

147
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:31,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it must be I didn't what it must</font>

148
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,259
think what what must be going on here IP

149
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,939
what's IP do you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

150
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:36,379
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter just think there</font>

151
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,449
must be something called IP it must be

152
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,589
something called TCP just<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

153
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:41,689
that must be going across the network

154
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,740
now you have packets packets contain

155
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,719
data you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what they</font>

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,949
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like necessarily maybe they do</font>

00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,909
different things they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

159
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:53,029
know what the switch is and you probably

160
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,649
have one in your house but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what</font>

161
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:56,089
it's actually doing under the hood think

162
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,389
about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits in this diagram that</font>

you're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with what about routing</font>

165
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,029
works maybe not maybe don't work in that

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,500
field imagine there must be something

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant just keep thinking about</font>

175
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,899
what that must look like now photons

00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:32,539
it trained being transferred<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

like

182
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,030
now you're talking about HTTP requests

probably closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wheelhouse if</font>

you've never seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP just imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

185
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,239
it must look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you have an HP request</font>

about bleeding you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how stuff works</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called bleeding so imagine</font>

what bleeding must be in context of of

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,750
your of your operating system now think

203
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,599
about bad actors think about

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,990
about this infrastructure that you just

00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:59,349
designer your brain now open your eyes

219
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">right with me no one fell asleep or late</font>

220
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,378
it's not too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point of that</font>

221
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,568
exercise is there is probably several

222
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:10,229
things in what you just designed in your

223
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:12,550
brain you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little fuzzy I would hope</font>

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone feel like there might be a couple</font>

225
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,379
spots maybe not super clear on what

226
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things are yeah I mean me too</font>

227
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">right there's there's parts of that that</font>

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,610
I'm not 100% comfortable with but that

229
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a blind spot that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a area where</font>

230
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,870
it's difficult to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who</font>

231
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,240
works in that space if we don't kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

232
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,549
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gap and figure out what those</font>

233
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,740
things actually are that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

234
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,049
what you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with your mind is</font>

235
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,930
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate model in the world</font>

236
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:43,689
that you have ever seen of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

237
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,189
things because you came up with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

238
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,350
it's not necessarily right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

239
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,630
necessarily complete but getting

240
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,030
where you were a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> seconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago to</font>

241
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,800
where the actual reality is that's the

242
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,699
learning process that's where you go

243
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,290
from ignorant to a specialist to a you

244
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,880
know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going to be able to</font>

245
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,020
stand in front of keynote fellow

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,970
thousands of people what's going on

247
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,319
right not that I know what's going on

248
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,690
you know what so just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

249
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,590
questions I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean how many of you do home</font>

250
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,850
network segmenting about maybe ten

251
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:21,520
fifteen percent how many of you put your

252
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,690
firewall on an admin network completely

253
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,460
separated three four of you okay how

254
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people use something substantially</font>

255
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,180
more secure than a default Linux like

move on to a red hat or something for

257
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,569
their web servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six all right how</font>

258
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harden the colonel above</font>

259
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,730
sort of the normal stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting rid of them in binaries services</font>

265
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,500
you and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people do logging</font>

266
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,850
substantially beyond what the default

267
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,340
like IAS or Apache does a little bit

268
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:12,520
more seven or eight so these these are

269
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,800
areas that basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost almost nothing</font>

270
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,900
usually this is not a very expensive

271
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,300
things that I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there but this is</font>

272
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,220
the fact that i would say less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

273
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,130
fifteen percent of you do the sum total

274
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,210
of all of this stuff is a is scary we

275
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,680
should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing all of these</font>

276
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,480
things these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are pretty simple</font>

277
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,599
things this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just a</font>

278
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,880
forensics exercise for the most part but

279
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,470
but it actually aids and security in so

280
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,820
many ways it's almost hard to articulate

281
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't start down the path</font>

282
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,000
of looking at these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these</font>

283
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,400
things are not traditional web<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps sec</font>

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,230
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more like sysadmin stuff but if</font>

288
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,939
security good thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give you a</font>

289
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,610
concrete example of where this

290
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,120
particular blind spot affects us in our

291
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,440
website world so there's this thing

292
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,410
called strict Transport Security have

293
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,899
you guys all heard of this

294
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay one or two of you guys so basically</font>

295
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:11,110
it allows so okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

296
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,670
websites one is HTTP the other ones HTTP

297
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,990
if you link from one to the other your

298
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,550
browser makes a quest you're going to

299
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,589
send the referring URL you have another

300
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,149
set of websites one of the ACPs one of

301
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,980
the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS you link to them</font>

302
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,500
you're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're all set if you</font>

303
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,050
go from https to http though nor from

304
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own I'm saying so strict Transport</font>

305
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,209
Security once upon a time was designed

306
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,149
by more or less by paypal to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

307
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:37,689
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pin my DNA my my web my</font>

308
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:39,639
browser rather so only goes to https so

309
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,800
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone tries to downgrade me using</font>

310
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,839
SSL stripper<font color="#CCCCCC"> midler or something I'm</font>

311
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,430
always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the HTTPS site so that</font>

312
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,199
seems all well and good it stops a lot

313
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,870
of types you know top different types of

314
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Manimal attacks or whatever the problem</font>

315
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,920
is that's really a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow way of</font>

316
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:55,899
thinking of the problem that's only

317
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,910
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack I'm trying to</font>

318
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,740
solve and the defense for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attack it's</font>

319
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,149
not thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ecosystem of all</font>

320
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,430
the things in the internet all of that

321
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:04,930
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can happen so the very first</font>

322
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,489
second I heard about it literally

323
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,739
someone told me in a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

324
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,000
like that's well one immediate thing I

325
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,420
know I can do off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top my head is</font>

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,240
used for tracking every bit of entropy

327
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,529
is one step closer to a DN autumn

328
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,059
ization it turns out you need about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

329
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:21,639
bits of entropy for the entire internet

330
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:23,469
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put up 30 different web servers</font>

331
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,089
they either have STS turn on or off or

332
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and I can pin it over the</font>

333
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,889
duration of the lifetime of law

334
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,839
comparable long I feel like making it

335
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:33,699
because it cannot be downgraded so it

336
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,379
effectively is a tracking pixel that

337
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:37,479
lasts for as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like making</font>

338
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,370
it last so the Google guys went back and

339
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,990
they fix that fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in some bizarre</font>

340
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,180
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually makes STS not very</font>

341
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,160
effective but but then I start thinking

342
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,750
it's also not so great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for privacy in</font>

343
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,189
the previous example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

344
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">where you know if you're blinking from</font>

345
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:52,500
https to http that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a very</font>

346
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">dangerous example where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> STS can be used</font>

347
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,610
against you so let's stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bank for</font>

348
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,459
instance a bank is on an internal

349
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,600
network or whatever or its external or

350
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,040
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really matter but</font>

351
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are linking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that they</font>

352
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily trust in the same way</font>

353
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,239
you might be

354
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,670
you know maybe as some kind of semi

355
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,310
shady mortgage lender or something but

356
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,810
they're linking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from https to http</font>

357
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,859
so they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of all the nonces</font>

358
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,050
and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be in the URL</font>

359
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,779
anything that might be dangerous any

360
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,420
privacy related information or whatever

361
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,610
so the problem is over time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

362
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,390
clicks on that link multiple times<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

363
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,279
set sts to push them up to https land so

364
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,279
the browser is now talking https to

365
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,870
https instead of https to http and now

366
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,510
referring your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> descent now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I get the</font>

367
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,400
knots see a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you're when</font>

368
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,050
you're looking at any design choices

369
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,480
like that that's a very simple example

370
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,199
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very couple of very large</font>

371
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,380
oversights in a single protocol a single

372
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,670
change the browser this is the kind of

373
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to get in front of</font>

374
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,740
I want you guys you know minions minions

375
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our hacker army here you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

376
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,670
mean go find these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there are so</font>

377
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,900
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge cases that people aren't</font>

378
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about and these are</font>

379
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,470
where the really serious boner abilities

380
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,420
lie and wait and only strike that

381
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,670
sometime far down the road when some

382
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,380
major shady service providers starts

383
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:17,140
going to SDS and starts getting all this

384
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:20,370
really dangerous information so there's

385
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">second blind spot is a little different</font>

386
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,010
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a couple presentations</font>

387
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,420
on this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it didn't really</font>

388
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,390
resonate throughout the industry as much

389
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,490
as it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have operational and</font>

390
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,100
travel security are really really

391
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,480
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our industry we have to</font>

392
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect ourselves first if we can't</font>

393
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">protect ourselves first we're never</font>

394
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect anybody else so if</font>

395
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,520
you're traveling with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

396
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,350
some harsh words for you so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon a</font>

397
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,199
time when I started this industry it was

398
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,060
a game it was a fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> game it was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

399
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of you know kind of miss ackers</font>

400
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,170
breaking into modems and stuff and I

401
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,819
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell the story of meat climbing</font>

402
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,130
telephone poles and you know clipping

403
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,510
into making free phone calls course I

404
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,500
know what a call so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

405
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason I went with jail but but it think</font>

406
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,850
things have changed in two completely

407
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,819
different ways one is it has become a

408
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,739
militarized internet we once upon a time

409
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,149
we were possibly worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

410
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:22,429
jail but we were not worried about the

411
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:24,379
military<font color="#E5E5E5"> infiltrating our internet that</font>

412
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:26,209
was not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

413
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,249
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about as far as a</font>

414
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,189
determined adversary and now more or

415
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:34,069
less every country who has a cyber army

416
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:37,939
or whatever is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

417
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:41,358
using it to their advantage but the

418
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:42,889
second way is that you know we as an

419
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:45,259
industry are starting to weaponize it

420
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:49,369
ourselves bad guys are really coming out

421
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:51,919
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that if you if you think</font>

422
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:56,209
about your travel security as being sort

423
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:57,679
of like well I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure to you</font>

424
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,049
know tell people I'm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of office so</font>

425
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,309
they know to not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that things in my</font>

426
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,228
behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm out of office or</font>

427
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,699
something that's that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

428
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:07,669
tip of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iceberg there's so much more</font>

429
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,439
to it I don't really care<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

430
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:12,109
to tweet I don't care if you can't

431
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:13,549
facebook if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't Google Plus while</font>

432
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:15,859
you're traveling I mean I know that that

433
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:17,089
seems like kind of a big deal in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

434
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:19,459
minutes that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get to do that</font>

435
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:22,309
while you're traveling or whatever but

436
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:23,839
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really isn't a big deal and we</font>

437
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:25,399
as professionals need to treat<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a</font>

438
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,649
professional organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> we cannot</font>

439
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,959
treat our security as if it's you know

440
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,129
something as simple as all I have to do

441
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,799
is close my laptop and I will secure

442
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:36,439
that's just not how it works determine

443
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:38,720
adversaries have gone gone along a lot

444
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">further if you really want to know the</font>

445
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">details come and talk to me and I'll</font>

446
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,959
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about all these kind of</font>

447
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:44,869
terrible things that have happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

448
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,669
we travel over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years but we are now</font>

449
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,470
playing a very different game than we

450
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:50,539
used to be playing and we have to treat

451
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,909
this as a type of game that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> lose</font>

452
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:55,249
very easily instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a game that we</font>

453
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:58,669
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to win than lose and</font>

454
00:16:55,249 --> 00:17:00,829
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes heavily with operational</font>

455
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:03,499
security and travel security so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

456
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:06,168
one is adversaries this is one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

457
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:07,819
spend a lot of personal time on the

458
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:09,679
company doesn't necessarily pay me to go

459
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,928
do this but I find a lot of value in

460
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,779
doing it I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time talking</font>

461
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,720
with bad guys here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another exercise</font>

462
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,029
for you so this uh this is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

463
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,939
you've all seen this before I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

464
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,559
it's sort of an introductory

465
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,809
psychological thing that they

466
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:27,490
tons of textbooks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is two</font>

467
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,649
different pictures at once one is a

468
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,129
beautiful young woman<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one is an old</font>

469
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:35,258
witch kind of woman and you know most

470
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can see both maybe it takes a</font>

471
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:39,429
little thinking before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

472
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,610
both and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can all you see both yeah</font>

473
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:44,950
ok so the CIA uses this as a good

474
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,110
demonstration exercise they say that

475
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a matter of seeing both it's</font>

476
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,570
how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see both and then</font>

477
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch back and forth if you can very</font>

478
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,499
rapidly switch between the two in your

479
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain and you can see both like as fast</font>

480
00:17:56,499 --> 00:18:00,429
as I'm moving my fingers kind of then

481
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:02,200
you're much more likely to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

482
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,080
tell what an adversary is doing in

483
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,850
context of whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying you're</font>

484
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,199
able to see both sides of the fence if

485
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,070
you can't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side of the</font>

486
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">fence you're not going to be very</font>

487
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective as an operational security</font>

488
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,259
person right you need to be able to know

489
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,299
what's happening on them on the bad side

490
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,159
as well as the good side so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ability</font>

491
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,908
your mental flexibility is very

492
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:24,039
important in this industry I think it's

493
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:25,899
very important to know your adversary I

494
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,600
don't mean know in the biblical sense

495
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:30,820
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mean no as in textbook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

496
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,949
I mean chocolate right I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

497
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,110
actually inner interact with them in a

498
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,730
personal level believe it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're</font>

499
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,350
all humans they actually are I know you

500
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,279
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are mostly robots just</font>

501
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,908
cuz that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in their logs</font>

502
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,350
but there's somebody behind all this and

503
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:48,460
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually very interesting</font>

504
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,110
people very smart very ambitious usually

505
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,629
have some of troubled past sometimes

506
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,449
there's sociopaths but they're very

507
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:57,369
interesting people more importantly they

508
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,490
do have feelings and they really very

509
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,689
often need somebody to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to and</font>

510
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">ironically it turns out security people</font>

511
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:06,039
are run some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best people for them</font>

512
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,209
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to they they know that they're</font>

513
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,789
telling you things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they shouldn't</font>

514
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,889
be telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yet they do it anyway</font>

515
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:14,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">so possibly they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't give away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

516
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:15,428
own special sauce or whatever but they

517
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,470
will tell you about people they want

518
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">busted problems in the industry things</font>

519
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,559
that worry them technologies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

520
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,149
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't working that's all</font>

521
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,168
very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> information for us to make</font>

522
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,299
informed<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions about what we're</font>

523
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:28,029
going to do in the future they have

524
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:29,679
interesting motives to it sometimes it's

525
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:30,759
just not as clear as I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

526
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,309
think it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's like oh it's a</font>

527
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,830
profit mode well yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but why are they</font>

528
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting</font>

529
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,129
like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose of getting a lot</font>

530
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,140
of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is for money's sake is</font>

531
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,610
not really very interesting usually

532
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:44,600
there's something else going on that's

533
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,949
driving them towards that I don't think

534
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that every adversary on earth is going</font>

535
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,730
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> there think there's some who are</font>

536
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,918
very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their own operational</font>

537
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,570
security and don't say a word kudos to

538
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,700
them but I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a lot</font>

539
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,168
that do want to talk and it's just a

540
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter of finding them and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think one</font>

541
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:00,200
of the problems our industry is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

542
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,489
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing as an industry to go find</font>

543
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and talk to them we're willing to find</font>

544
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,210
them to bust them but we're not willing

545
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,279
to stop and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them and hear what</font>

546
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">we hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on I tell every bad</font>

547
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,950
guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I talk to I'm not going to try</font>

548
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,928
to put you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jail I might go after your</font>

549
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,760
tactics you know try to try to fix

550
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,080
what's wrong with our industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm</font>

551
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,750
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to put you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in jail</font>

552
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,730
personally it's just it breaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> my you</font>

553
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,919
know my intelligence Shane it's stupid

554
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,620
it's very similar to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that we we</font>

555
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,000
block on fire walls by IP address it's a

556
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,580
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tells the</font>

557
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,480
attacker exactly what not to do tells

558
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,860
them how they're caught breaks the

559
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,740
fourth wall it's a very dangerous idea

560
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,168
should not do it so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need somebody</font>

561
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,120
to approve it right a lot of people feel

562
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:41,000
like oh I don't I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go do</font>

563
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,889
that you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed to go do that just</font>

564
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,130
tell them the arsenic sent you the

565
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:47,510
internet the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sent you right you</font>

566
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,679
can go ahead and blame me but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

567
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,649
for this don't blame me<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anything</font>

tart fixation this is actually one of

578
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,250
the more annoying things to me

579
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,559
personally in the industry I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vollmar created equal so it</font>

00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,290
something you're working on and I

<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly would not discourage you not</font>

600
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,040
leads to all kinds of discoveries and

00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:04,379
it's you know self filling in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds</font>

602
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,379
of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways but but there are</font>

603
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,929
some serious problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so every</font>

604
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,750
couple of years about every two years or

605
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,700
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring on a protege and I teach them</font>

606
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually it's about six months or so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

607
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,970
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go off and do whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

609
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,630
or whatever but but what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed</font>

610
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,429
with my protege is in all the cases

611
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,890
almost near a hundred percent of them

612
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:28,020
cannot accurately do a dread severity

613
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,640
rating for a vulnerability at least not

614
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,750
off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuff they can do it on paper if</font>

615
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you sit them down and you</font>

616
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,290
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them draw it out on paper</font>

617
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,780
they can get pretty close to the right

618
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:39,240
answer there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little rusty but</font>

619
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:42,600
they can they can manage it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in their</font>

620
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,309
head they absolutely cannot do it so I

621
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,299
would challenge you if you see a bunch

622
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,770
of vulnerabilities a stack of

623
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:49,260
vulnerabilities coming in from a scanner

624
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,879
or whatever don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on the scanners</font>

625
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,559
prioritization just just take the

626
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,559
vulnerability and do your own dread

627
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,168
severity on it and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think do</font>

628
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,730
a mental version first see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you kind</font>

629
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,470
of your gut tells you is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

630
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">high when it says it to hire whatever</font>

631
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,250
you know to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I agree or it's</font>

632
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,500
not or whatever and then do it on paper

633
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,960
and really think about what the actual

634
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,270
damage potential reproducibility impact

635
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,770
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are about that</font>

636
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular vulnerability and I think you</font>

637
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:19,889
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find in a large amount of cases</font>

638
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,900
your gut is not correct the dread impact

639
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,450
is actually very different in many cases

640
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,890
than your gut will probably tell you and

641
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,590
that's that's a problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry</font>

642
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,660
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often say this is a terrible bone and</font>

643
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,059
then we go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an analysis of it</font>

644
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,380
we're like well it's kind of no one

645
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,899
would ever care about this phone that'll

646
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,700
never be used yes theoretically in some

647
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,210
bizarro world this could be bad but it's

648
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,250
not so I don't want to say that your

649
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">baby isn't special but your baby isn't</font>

650
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,400
very special you know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

651
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,080
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of very similar</font>

652
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,540
vulnerabilities out there to almost

653
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,460
everything we've ever done and I don't

654
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,780
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get hyper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foe</font>

655
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,180
done that one particular thing because

656
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,220
you came up with it I know a lot of

657
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,540
researchers security penetration testers

658
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,460
they're like so excited because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

659
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,500
found one thing and I'm like yes that's

660
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,730
a good job but it's a kind of a low

661
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,310
severity and they're like no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a high</font>

662
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,530
severity online nope it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high</font>

663
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,629
severity when you actually do the

664
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,040
analysis it very often ends up being

665
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,310
significantly less impactful<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I</font>

666
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:21,560
think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be ultimately I</font>

667
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:25,550
want you to focus a little bit more on

668
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ecosystem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so I did some</font>

669
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:31,159
analysis a couple weeks back<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found i</font>

670
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,990
sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for a weekend actually most the</font>

671
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,930
weekend<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sent spent installing stuff</font>

672
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,280
but i decided i was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you</font>

673
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,920
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a handful of open source CMS</font>

674
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,930
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found off-the-shelf install</font>

675
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,640
them and just start hacking on all of

676
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,980
them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of see what I find so</font>

677
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,920
I found 70 days which I have not

678
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:52,100
published that are all you know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

679
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,270
say medium to high severity and so i

680
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,830
decided well i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what</font>

681
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,600
happens on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this vulnerability broker</font>

682
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,790
market so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to see what how this</font>

683
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,840
all works from personal experience I

684
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,060
have never messed with them so I should

685
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,740
try right it's a blind spot I don't know

686
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,240
how that industry works or that part of

687
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,190
the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> works so I went and</font>

688
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,860
actually attempted to sell all of my

689
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:11,570
bones to see what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it turns</font>

690
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,030
out that every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them got</font>

691
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,760
kicked back wholesale they didn't want a

692
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,920
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them and I asked them like</font>

693
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,660
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> why would this be kick kick back I</font>

694
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,130
mean some of these you go to web page I

695
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,080
get a shell on your box I mean it's

696
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that bad very very simple</font>

697
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know cross-site request forgery</font>

709
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,850
exact same level access to the exact

710
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,709
same box if it comes through exploit

711
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,379
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> web base for instance is worth</font>

712
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:03,170
zero dollars on that same marketing 0 so

713
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:06,530
$100,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero exact</font>

714
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:08,030
access so i talked with my<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackhead</font>

715
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,120
friends I'm like okay what would this

716
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,280
same bone go for on the underground like

717
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,750
what would that cost what would how much

718
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,670
money I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your on</font>

719
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,530
your underground<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets they said well</font>

720
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,630
a link to us on a single web page

721
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,490
depending on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page so there's</font>

722
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,290
some caveats there is worth about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

723
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,850
hundred dollars so if you can get it on

724
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,920
20,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> web pages that's worth about a</font>

725
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,169
million dollars to us so the disparity

726
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,140
between zero dollars and a million

727
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:35,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars is a blind spot we're definitely</font>

728
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,430
missing out on a lot of very very

729
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">serious bones that the black hats do</font>

730
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,310
care about I don't care if there's no

731
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,990
buyer for it the black cats care about

732
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,360
it they will buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and that basically</font>

733
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,670
pushes security researchers to do bad

734
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,060
things because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good</font>

735
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:53,000
place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put those things that that</font>

736
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,320
worries me along so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this</font>

737
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,240
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing</font>

738
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,800
what they have they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

739
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,110
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> even what's in their own</font>

740
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,520
environment they don't understand what's

741
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,280
important to them they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

742
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,690
that box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can get a shell on also</font>

743
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,730
has access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of other crazy</font>

744
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:10,250
things because when i hack it i hack all

745
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,440
these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so you know simple</font>

746
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,480
things like go download fierce it's a

747
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,340
tool i wrote a long time ago run it

748
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,070
across all your site all your domains

749
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,770
does be NASA numeration it'll get all of

750
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,659
your potential sub domains that I can

751
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,430
find then you can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

752
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,100
search find all kinds of other unrelated

753
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,230
subdomains on shared hosting you can use

754
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,939
nmap<font color="#CCCCCC"> masscan unicorn scan or whatever to</font>

755
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,200
find the actual ports that are open and

756
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,090
you should actually look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

757
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,650
and figure out is this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

758
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,419
that's sitting out there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

759
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">guarantee you if you can find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

these tools a bad guy can find it using

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:48,230
these tools so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

762
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,820
comes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things like GRC which I'm</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge fan of but I think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding what you have and the</font>

765
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,899
value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your assets is very very</font>

766
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,970
important if you aren't supplying some

767
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,030
sort of GRC tool whether it's an actual

right it doesn't matter if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

771
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,080
cataloging all your assets and defining

what the value of those things are

773
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,240
you're probably not spending in the

774
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:16,970
right place but this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

775
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,920
a free pass to be antagonistic or road

to other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you know better what bones are worth</font>

781
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,760
along we all make mistakes we all have

<font color="#CCCCCC">to learn this is I'm sure one that you</font>

783
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,410
are a little bit more familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

784
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,540
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some particular comments on I</font>

785
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,830
think one of the bigger blind spots I

786
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,750
see in this industry is compliance

787
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,730
versus security I see so many people

788
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,800
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about compliance as if it is</font>

789
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">security those two things are really not</font>

790
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,879
actually very closely related<font color="#CCCCCC"> in many</font>

791
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,950
ways sometimes compliance can drive good

792
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">security practice but that's you know a</font>

793
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,500
kind of a step away so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you</font>

794
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,910
one anecdote that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally love mmm</font>

795
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,050
so I was working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one client</font>

796
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:06,500
when I was used to be an independent

797
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">consultant and I gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them a full it's a</font>

798
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,100
legitimate Volm this actually can be

799
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,830
used against you I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider it a</font>

800
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:16,219
kind of medium level<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeball not super</font>

801
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:20,629
bad and not particularly likely but but

802
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,580
semi bad and instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of</font>

803
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,530
acknowledging the fact that this volan

804
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,870
existed and saying okay well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

805
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,070
agree with whatever reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> you came up</font>

806
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:30,439
with and why we should fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

807
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,879
say look well you'll put<font color="#E5E5E5"> up sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of put</font>

808
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,750
it aside or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> what will log it</font>

809
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do anything about</font>

810
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,540
it which would have been fairly

811
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,990
reasonable i would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have complained</font>

812
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,610
instead they just wholesale ignored me

813
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,390
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason they did that is because</font>

814
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular Vaughn wouldn't and if</font>

815
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,890
they fail compliance that could be worth

816
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,639
millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to them ignoring me</font>

817
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost them nothing so this is called</font>

818
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,260
willful negligence when you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> court</font>

819
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,559
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard thing to</font>

820
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,720
stand behind you really should have some

821
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,280
sort of carve out to allow yourself to

822
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,870
have phones when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that they're</font>

823
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">Devon that you don't want to fix it's a</font>

824
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,919
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more reasonable way to think about</font>

825
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:11,510
a moment you know maybe not maybe your

826
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,370
whole business is relying on having this

827
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,379
phone for instance that's that's fine

828
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:20,870
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least make note of it</font>

829
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:22,520
you know copy it down I think part of

830
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:24,159
the problem that from my perspective is

831
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,560
compliance forces you to span

832
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,200
areas that don't actually help your own

833
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,090
security there's a ton of research on

834
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,650
why I'm not trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick on antivirus</font>

835
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,330
in particular but since you've heard it

836
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,160
before antivirus but there's other

837
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,570
similar software out there ids is for

838
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance i'm not a particularly huge fan</font>

839
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,929
of your job creator unless you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

840
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else right they don't really</font>

841
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:47,350
make sense but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think compliance forces</font>

842
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,389
you to put your dollars in places that

843
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,550
are not most effective for your security

844
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,650
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't done a good threat model</font>

845
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,970
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good one and analyze actually</font>

846
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,400
what your phones are you're probably

847
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,050
spending in the wrong place just you

848
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's just simple right you're</font>

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,960
putting money in one place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're I</font>

850
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,050
hope that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right place you're</font>

851
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,710
probably spending in the wrong place

852
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:10,780
also I did some work on some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large</font>

853
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,090
banking infrastructure for a while and

854
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,330
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I noticed was bits was</font>

855
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,740
probably one of the more comprehensive

856
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,240
self-assessment things are sick was one

857
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,950
of the more comprehensive documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

858
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,110
ever read about security it goes

859
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,520
everything fire escapes all the way

860
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,659
through all the entire stack of

861
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,000
everything you'd have to worry about all

862
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,960
the cssp stuff through through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OS</font>

863
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,660
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 the problem is bad guys really do</font>

864
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,370
not care about the OS top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 they don't</font>

865
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,540
they do not care at all about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

866
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,060
only care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how they can break</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

867
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,740
websites so from my perspective you know

868
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">being one that would like to catalog</font>

869
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,920
every film maybe it doesn't matter that

870
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ball is there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's low</font>

871
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,070
severity but I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have at least a</font>

872
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,620
list of everything I know what those

873
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,260
risks are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach them and I said I</font>

874
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,520
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help you evolve it and add</font>

875
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,960
a whole bunch of stuff there's a whole

876
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of things I have on there and they</font>

877
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,270
came back to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well because</font>

878
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not a bank you're not a financial</font>

880
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so unbelievably dangerous and I</font>

881
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,420
tell you so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where compliance</font>

882
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,159
does not need security at all and the

883
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,920
other problem is hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolve very</font>

884
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,660
very rapidly<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some bones they've</font>

885
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,240
managed to hang on to just because

886
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,650
they're super easy one things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

887
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,300
thought was interesting is that SQL

888
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,620
injection is still their favorite even

889
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,180
though command injection technically

890
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,500
gives them more the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because</font>

891
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:31,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">thats cool injection is easier that is</font>

892
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,800
something that sure compliance will help

893
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,810
you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they say we're covering</font>

894
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,860
all the most common phones but there's a

895
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:40,270
lot of uncommon ball

896
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:42,010
out that the bad guys also news so the

897
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,320
last blind spot i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

898
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,000
is a consumer and this one's kind of

899
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,659
near and dear to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i spent a lot of</font>

900
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,530
time talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them so this is kind of</font>

901
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:56,410
a particular mille website out there has

902
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,260
a whole bunch of embedded content in it

903
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:02,380
this this tool is called request policy

904
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> firefox and i think the average</font>

905
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,820
person doesn't really realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

906
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,440
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> website today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

907
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,470
three-dimensional thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

908
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,030
two-dimensional you know flat thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

909
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,260
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you're visualizing it's a</font>

00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,790
fairy three dimension does all kinds of

911
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,070
things going on there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there is a</font>

z-axis things can live above or below

913
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,600
things and because consumers can't see

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can't really articulate to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">them like there could be something</font>

invisibly happening here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> resonate with people don't it's</font>

918
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,159
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun really it sounds like fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

919
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,350
not really fun because there is stuff

920
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,809
that they can't see happening but but it

921
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,969
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help consumers giving</font>

922
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:41,950
them weird advice like oh you should you

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy a link down or whatever now</font>

we'll save you that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

925
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,110
very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> advice if you're relying on</font>

00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,910
them to makes their own security

927
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:52,149
decisions you've already sort of lost

928
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the battle they don't get the complexity</font>

00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,890
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in so many different</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part or</font>

937
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,869
their mail is the internet you know they

938
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,179
they don't they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that</font>

939
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:17,710
is is that is I've actually talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

940
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,840
people who think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in their computer</font>

941
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,970
that this thing contains the internet

942
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,980
like I'm caring internet around you know

943
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,388
what I mean they don't really understand

944
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,190
the principles of what's going on I I

945
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:28,690
meant one guy who actually thought the

946
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,350
internet was a town in northern

947
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:35,560
california he actually had no idea as a

948
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,359
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine in front of my said so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

949
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to spend more time</font>

950
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,350
talking to actual human beings not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

951
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,940
spent a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time the echo chamber</font>

952
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,210
talking to each other and that's it's

953
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,530
fine for evolving ideas and in solving

954
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,389
blind spots but it's

955
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,000
arable for understand what consumers are

956
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,290
capable of understanding I spent a lot

957
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time talking to cab drivers</font>

958
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,580
bartenders and waitresses because these

959
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,319
people are paid to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to me and so</font>

960
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,120
if I answer asking them questions like

961
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,620
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about paypal security</font>

962
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,630
you know what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean they'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh</font>

963
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,740
it's bad I got a phishing email it's

964
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,300
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

965
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,040
paypal security of fishing right that's

966
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the whole mental model about</font>

967
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,540
everything related to paypal security

968
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:16,029
which is great because that that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

969
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,680
helps you make design decisions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

970
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,720
say what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did this like I'll ask</font>

971
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,950
people like you know second factor

972
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,870
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like what if I told</font>

973
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,540
you this didn't actually make you more

974
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,589
safe would you still like it like yeah

975
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,860
okay that's interesting right that's

976
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:31,240
useful information thank you know

977
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,650
there's a there's a trust indicator

978
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,279
versus security those things are

979
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:38,380
different in consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds they also</font>

980
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,940
don't understand the security risks of

981
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,260
aim one particular action of what

982
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,350
they're doing and we have these really

983
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,910
terrible things we tell them to go do

984
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,680
like like my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite is cut and paste</font>

985
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,750
links out of email it's like what is

986
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that how is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that helping anything I mean</font>

987
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,680
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think about it really i mean</font>

988
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,509
they don't know what a URL is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

989
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,549
have run into multiple people that don't

990
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">even know that URL bar is something you</font>

991
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,030
can type in they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's static and</font>

992
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,500
it just changes on its own and they

993
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know they didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

994
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,360
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and type in something so</font>

995
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even that very simple indicator</font>

996
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,180
that it's a white box and you can

997
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,970
probably touch it and do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

998
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I ran into one security person who</font>

999
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,520
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't you make it</font>

1000
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,290
so people can't change that so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1001
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,640
this is the level that we're at right

1002
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,410
these are the types of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

1003
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,759
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and that's okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1004
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,589
don't want to say that those people are

1005
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,210
bad people or stupid or whatever but

1006
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,740
they definitely are not capable of

1007
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,940
making informed decisions we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not</font>

1008
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,879
armed them with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right information</font>

1009
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,200
and i will conjecture that we cannot

1010
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,510
harm them with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct information</font>

1011
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,390
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is impossible given the magnitude of</font>

1012
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem therefore the only answer is</font>

1013
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:46,870
to give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like opt-out</font>

1014
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,460
security they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with good security</font>

1015
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,089
and then they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do work to get out</font>

1016
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,400
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that secure you know infrastructure</font>

1017
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,740
thank you

1018
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,080
but there's no more thing as optional

1019
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,560
security in the in the other direction

1020
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,990
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't opt into security opt out</font>

1021
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,509
so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one problem that</font>

1022
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,660
we as a security industry phase is we

1023
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:11,310
are not actually pro-consumer we've

1024
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,259
spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pro-business</font>

1025
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,299
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot of time protecting</font>

1026
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,310
corporations but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a lot of</font>

1027
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,730
time protecting consumers and the

1028
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:23,100
problem is unlike pretty much any time

1029
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:25,290
in human history everything we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now</font>

1030
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,299
tracked log but the exact same systems

1031
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,279
that we use to track and log bad guys

1032
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,170
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> err on the side of</font>

1033
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,510
corporations instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side of</font>

1034
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,860
consumers that information might start

1035
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,290
haunting us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the</font>

1036
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,150
not-too-distant future i highly

1037
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,640
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you sort of citing</font>

1038
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,200
against consumers taking their privacy

1039
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,390
away from them<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you seriously</font>

1040
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,100
reconsider that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not-too-distant</font>

1041
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,620
future not saying you can't change sides

1042
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,660
eventually but if there ever were a sort

1043
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,759
of a forthcoming war against consumers

1044
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,379
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking their privacy back</font>

1045
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,750
you will be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the losing side of that</font>

1046
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,880
battle trust me legislation will either

1047
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,610
win or the ground swell of the consumers

1048
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,710
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really really stress this</font>

1049
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,690
if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling</font>

1050
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">me that advertisers should be able to do</font>

1051
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,760
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want and the fact that you</font>

1052
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,370
know I'm you're an advertiser and you're

1053
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,770
showing single hot ladies to my child or

1054
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,660
whatever and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

1055
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,100
legitimately you just need more tracking

1056
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,440
data so that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a</font>

1057
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,910
child you're not going to win<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fight</font>

1058
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,140
you're going to lose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's going</font>

1059
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on your record for a very very</font>

1060
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,089
long time it's hard to remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

1061
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,550
so I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this to say something a</font>

1062
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:35,640
little bit different right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are six</font>

1063
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,320
blind spots I think you could tackle any

1064
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,609
one of these very easily I mean they're

1065
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,910
none at none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are particularly</font>

1066
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,950
difficult if you tackle even one of them

1067
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:45,950
as a general you know average across

1068
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,240
this room you've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

1069
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,430
approximately you know sixteen seventeen

1070
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,290
percent better I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

1071
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy thing to do I think it's easy to</font>

1072
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,440
challenge yourself to be just a little

1073
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,970
bit more conscientious about what's

1074
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,750
going on the industry open your eyes a

1075
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit these are the six blind spots</font>

1076
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,620
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> my time is up here but I would</font>

1077
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the person next to</font>

1078
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pick one commit to it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1079
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,130
don't

1080
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,540
to it you'll never do it you'll walk on

1081
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,520
this room you'll forget this thing ever

1082
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,250
happened think about it think about

1083
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,300
which one resonates with you do it and

1084
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,320
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be a little bit less block</font>

1085
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,320
thank you

1086
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,360
you
