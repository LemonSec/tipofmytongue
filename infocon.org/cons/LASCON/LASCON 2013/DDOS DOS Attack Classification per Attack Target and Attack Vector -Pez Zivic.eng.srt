15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,850
these boring certifications but um I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,670
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somehow pulled into denial of</font>

17
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:16,100
service defenses with most major banks

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,750
and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so um that's how I</font>

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,259
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> started research in this area I</font>

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,270
like to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quote or slightly the</font>

21
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,560
quote if someone is if someone you're

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">always thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or like that somebody</font>

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,420
isn't thinking and that was sort of the

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,310
quote in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspiration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I took to</font>

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,390
do this to do this research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alou</font>

26
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:40,369
this talk simply because we a lot of

27
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and Justin like an army and try</font>

28
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,209
to think about the says just like one

29
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:50,060
another nuisance anything is not

30
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:51,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> using so let's start with the</font>

31
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,410
reason why I'm sorry this all the banks

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been attacked these guys have</font>

33
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:01,280
actually on sep tember 18 almost here

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,860
and something ago they started to attack

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,780
these banks what was really interesting

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:10,818
with this attack this was the first time

37
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:14,450
that the attack was<font color="#E5E5E5"> organized it was</font>

38
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:16,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">well funded and another really really</font>

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,929
important thing they did extensive HTTP

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,840
reconnaissance before this time no one

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,090
has done this right and how they've done

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,710
it it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you just</font>

43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,150
use a course or whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

44
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,780
and pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much is just one we get</font>

45
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,070
script wine that you can use and browse

46
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,970
the web sites and<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect the</font>

47
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,890
information from those websites it's

48
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple to do a snippy</font>

49
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,549
reconnaissance but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

50
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,679
detect who is the engage deep

51
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:52,420
reconnaissance of you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,550
I would say almost impossible so how did

53
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,679
I feel I was very pissed because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

54
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:02,290
banks / down it made me look at you know

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,440
ourselves and say do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys really</font>

56
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,700
can hurt us this much like really and

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,600
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing wrong right so as</font>

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:15,880
every every good smart guy or guy who's

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,049
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be smart I made a Freddie city</font>

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,510
i say i'm going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some research</font>

61
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:23,290
because this we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

62
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,959
something different right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i looked at</font>

63
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,299
the PHP papers trust me it's a good

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,710
sleep less medication start reading

65
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,190
those piercing papers you fall asleep

66
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,570
like this um you try to do some visit

67
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,620
some hacker sites and you can actually

68
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,630
buy different types of attacks for

69
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,570
twenty bucks you can attack me JP Morgan

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,579
Chase for three months twenty bucks they

71
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,859
give you the IP however if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,810
same tube that Bank of America they'll

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,690
charge an enormous amount of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

74
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,640
to your credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card because you violated</font>

75
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,820
harker contract agreement so I know it

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,790
just just took you know I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,239
certain of us it's more about process

78
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,420
and it has some validity but we need to

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,900
look at better things I look at other

80
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,369
vendors what they are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our solution</font>

81
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,670
is the best that this is the song right

82
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:20,858
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five so our solution is the</font>

83
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:23,110
best so what were the findings um p

84
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:26,049
three papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposed some solutions but</font>

85
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,910
there was one particular that stuck to

86
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,960
me it says we should really really

87
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,820
really near the internet or really then

88
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,690
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have power it is some some good good</font>

89
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,950
stuff um hockey shellcode<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

90
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,469
organizations are good with<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident</font>

91
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,800
management processes and vendors vendors

92
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,280
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> list attacks and</font>

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,110
f5 is to blame for that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

94
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,940
see an attack hope we see some weather

95
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,009
is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what developer protection for</font>

96
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,190
school earth<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm what if I as far</font>

97
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,870

99
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,919
it's a new attack right those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,080
types of problems that there is no

101
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,590
protection mechanism so much has<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

102
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:12,389
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we protect against any type</font>

103
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,400
of the analysis is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so there is no</font>

104
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:15,870
structured approach that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my honey</font>

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,179
there is no one who spoke about this

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,370
before no open organization that

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,530
actually works from this a little

108
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,270
information from victims thanks for like

109
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,080
oh we're fine we're fine you were dumb

110

and you were fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> good good for you um</font>

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,758
also there is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooperation am i</font>

112
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm from f5 I approached hardware and

113
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,680
said hey guys let's work together we can

114
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">make this work better like go away so</font>

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,050
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the types of things that I</font>

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,219
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> across in my life so pretty much I</font>

117
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,169
fell for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> chasing my tail or I felt</font>

118
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,779
like this thank God will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never do</font>

119
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:54,810
anything so as a good engineer I decided

120
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's do something better let's do</font>

121
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,270
it yourself mode right try to do it

122
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,460
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I picked over the fence and</font>

123
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,150
so try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what other guys are doing</font>

124
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:09,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I discovered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

125
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,758
amount of service signatures and this is

126
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,789
really really not good as I said slow

127
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rory's PES Lori's you know Kelly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lori's</font>

128
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,680
whoever he wants to if you change the

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">signature they remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tension so</font>

130
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,669
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem that we have</font>

131
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:26,849
university today what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are trying to</font>

132
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,590
do is constantly push up here and I was

133
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like let's step back and let's try to</font>

134
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,469
find a method that will actually help

135
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,139
you not fight like this right because

136
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:42,449
this is exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are doing so</font>

137
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:45,090
idea dos attack classification how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

138
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so I started collecting the attacks</font>

139
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,849
of anything that I can find out there

140
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,710
only where to lay<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven all that that's</font>

141
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">like think of</font>

142
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:58,310
who remembers ping of that here fame was

145
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,789
analyze what how these attacks are

146
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,820
attacking you so what is the vehicle

147
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">what is the end target right because the</font>

148
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the purpose is to find the target</font>

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,270
classify it those targets and then

150
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,400
verify the classification do it all over

151
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,840
again always<font color="#E5E5E5"> so idea is to use</font>

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,539
pacification instead of developing

153
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,549
against hundreds of attacks or any new

154
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,160
attack that shows up what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

155
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,340
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is develop protection for few</font>

156
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,620
classes right protect the target that's

157
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,150
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time did not</font>

158
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,770
protect against a single attack because

159
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,870
Eric tomorrow there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a new attack</font>

160
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will haunt you right so these are</font>

161
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,430
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really need to do the</font>

162
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,770
other thing that we achieved when we

163
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,140
have a classification and where we

164
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,260
develop protection mechanisms was we

165
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,840
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have surprises it's a large simple</font>

166
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,539
it's a over times that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed it's</font>

167
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,719
a large quantification of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> duck's and</font>

168
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,090
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop those categories properly</font>

169
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">every new attack will fall into one of</font>

170
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,150
those categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will have a dust</font>

171
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:09,200
protection mechanisms so I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

172
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,820
good or more like this so let's there

173
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,420
and get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing the attack</font>

174
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,430
protection I have occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them of a</font>

175
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,790
kind of different attacks I<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze the</font>

176
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,360
tax tax mechanisms and look how they

177
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,850
initiate does so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today these</font>

178
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,010
are the categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you might pick</font>

179
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,420
so let me step back this year at Def Con

180
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,640
some other guys they're also attempted

181
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,799
to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pacification and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in an</font>

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,600
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will find will be metric</font>

183
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,150
this is a clear you know we sent the

184
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,470
flood of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data file of something and then</font>

185
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,990
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with which some</font>

186
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,030
people call a symmetric and the guy who

187
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,890
the famous guy who wrote the book about

188
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,079
asymmetric attacks is calling them a

189
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,689
symmetric nice I tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divide them to</font>

190
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,790
21 is stateful<font color="#CCCCCC"> base that attack which</font>

191
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">abuses your time out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of recession state</font>

192
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,449
like slow loris right so where it

193
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,570
doesn't either work a lot of bandwidth

194
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,800
which just<font color="#CCCCCC"> collects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and exhaust your</font>

195
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,750
connection cable

196
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,089
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack and you're done you</font>

197
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,209
cannot serve it computational like ssl

198
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,070
renegotiation where I ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> your CPU give</font>

199
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,160
me the keys give me the keys your CPU is

200
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:18,680
just crunching the keys never completes

201
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,719
that in and as a result is time to stop

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,370
serving your application right and then

203
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,769
you have availability vulnerability such

204
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,810
as a particular at that right or a price

205
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,510
zero-day attack right so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

206
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,180
types of a job then that you can do this

207
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,149
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course there is a also</font>

208
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">end always a what people called blended</font>

209
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:42,290
or they were disability line including

210
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,690
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> V attacks and that's pretty much</font>

211
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,420
what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sessions to change abuse</font>

212
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,750
combination of the two types right I

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,370
could afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something else right</font>

214
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,380
front and ssl renegotiation actually one

215
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,940
bank got hit with I see it before the

216
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,860
necessary negotiation while they were

217
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,390
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with I same people are ssl</font>

218
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,410
renegotiation brought the service that's

219
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:06,260
the story so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's look at some of the</font>

220
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,939
samples of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks on this is the</font>

221
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,459
samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack these are the tools</font>

222
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,779
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy on the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at that</font>

223
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:13,910
those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools you will see man</font>

224
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,649
where there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no tool but you just have</font>

225
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,540
a code and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the sort of</font>

226
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:20,149
protocols that your attack and these are

227
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,099
the sort of what are the vehicles for

228
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:24,290
those attacks or targets right what do

229
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,820
you do with this one right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Venus</font>

230
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,189
reflection amplification I ran out of

231
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,750
room so reflection amplification is on

232
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:34,070
the same attack but it's it's good so if

233
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,130
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this list that's</font>

234
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,810
something that you know a protocol later

235
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,839
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the stateful attached</font>

236
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:46,310
pretty much slower lower tax low get low

237
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,470
post<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower raised on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero windows for</font>

238
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:51,109
responding URL right those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the types</font>

239
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,010
of our tags that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will see as your</font>

240
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:56,770
slope attacks again they exhaust your

241
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,779
collection table so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

242
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,800
computational and these are the attacks

243
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:06,439
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are xml DTD XML external entity</font>

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,120
ssl renegotiation crafted header we're

245
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,839
through Heather I actually issue a

246
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,209
command and your web server starts

247
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,640
calculating and pretty much stopped

248
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:18,410
serving your application

249
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,250
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> billet the abuse attacks</font>

250
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:30,650
a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash dos attack a buffer</font>

251
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:32,810
overflows yes yeah there is all stuff

252
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:36,709
here Pink of that is another one I said

253
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,819
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put the samples together and so</font>

254
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,430
that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do the</font>

255
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,720
classification of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks why I need</font>

256
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,050
this classification to develop

257
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,550
protection mechanisms so distributed

258
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,010
denial of service you have slim floods

259
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,620
slow loris that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacks</font>

260
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:54,500
and then syn flood and crafted URL so

261
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,560
when they do a URL reconnaissance they

262
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,630
craft URLs that are actually responding

263
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,780
slow and it's also a stateful or

264
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,370
computational types of attacks so we're

265
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting somewhere I can see it's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

266
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,660
a delight to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the tunnel so</font>

267
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,180
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to protection</font>

268
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,130
mechanisms again safety guy how do we

269
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,140
develop protection mechanisms for

270
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,760
volumetric types of attacks for

271
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">automatic types of attacks you have</font>

272
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,850
different offerings but dose is a

273
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,579
service is one of the offerings where

274
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,290
you spread the attack over the internet

275
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,790
and pretty much what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do with</font>

276
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,770
volumetric attacks keep them out of your

277
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,370
data center deal with those at the

278
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">perimeter right you can do bgp you can</font>

279
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,940
use redirects um there was a talk this

280
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,829
year at the black head if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are using</font>

281
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,680
cloud service dos as a service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

282
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,500
are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS redirect it's a really bad</font>

283
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea you do not have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those protection if</font>

284
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,570
you do that so make sure that you verify

285
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,100
with your cloud service provider what

286
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,260
you are trying to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

287
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,860
attack your IP directly and it will

288
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,020
completely bypass this cloud service

289
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,150
session resets rate-limiting instead

290
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,310
client protection verification what how

291
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">how does that work when you get a flood</font>

292
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,560
you want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> which sessions are good</font>

293
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,939
which sessions are bad so have a tool

294
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,439
that actually insert some quiet

295
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,690
verification check whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

296
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,100
browser or a botnet right that's that's

297
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,830
something that you you should be doing

298
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">but in general you can try to keep this</font>

299
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:28,050
in the perimeter so look at the state

300
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:30,180
full protection right how does

301
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:34,189
full protection attack work these are

302
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,479
really really really hard to protect

303
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,580
what does it abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> it abuses your</font>

304
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,459
timeouts right because you're abusing

305
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,800
two timeouts<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have your network</font>

310
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,440
minutes on so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really hard</font>

311
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,720
what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that it's better if</font>

312
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a proxy based firewall or your</font>

313
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,620
application delivery controller that

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,130
sits in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your applications you</font>

315
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,079
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it as a tool that actually can</font>

316
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,430
control the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of connections that</font>

317
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,229
are being established towards your

318
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,569
servers so it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more of</font>

319
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity planning and it takes more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

320
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,130
you know calculations on your behalf but

321
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,469
to protect against these types of

322
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,899
attacks you should be able to control

323
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,579
number of connections or concurrent

324
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,230
connections that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

325
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:36,270
your infrastructure that's the basic

326
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:38,880
idea yes so you start from the front

327
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,279
your firewall at the beginning like<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

328
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,750
the perimeter then you start at you your

329
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,730
IDPs you start with your proxy or

330
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,880
application delivery controller you

331
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,610
start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your servers and anything in</font>

332
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,010
between so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to align them the</font>

333
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,910
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that your</font>

334
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,500
firewall your ADC your server can handle

335
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,750
different numbers of connections right

336
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,670
concurrent connections that's a really

337
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,680
really important thing because why

338
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,930
firewalls failover when when they said

339
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">like when solaris happens who folds them</font>

340
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,520
first firewalls why because when you

341
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,130
have currently 50,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> co kerry</font>

342
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,260
connections no matter how you configure

343
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,649
the firewall their network stack is

344
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,269
going to be busy they go down they stop

345
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,220
serving packets right so those are

346
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,620
attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you know you can</font>

347
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,449
do and have a mechanism somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

348
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network where you can remove all</font>

349
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:35,219
the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> first so you should be able</font>

350
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a timer and say if the session</font>

351
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,199
is older than five minutes I'm going to

352
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">clean it I don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

353
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,469
cleaning

354
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,180
and for this and if you build their type

355
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,370
of a protection you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care is it a</font>

356
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,620
slow loris is it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PEZ Lori's or is it a</font>

357
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,330
slow post or whatever type of slow

358
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,110
attack you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a good</font>

359
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,270
protection mechanism another one is for

360
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,290
your computational and this is this one

361
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,199
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really hard XML DTD attack is</font>

362
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:07,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one where you send the calculation</font>

363
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,150
to the you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> web server your SSL</font>

364
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,589
renegotiation this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

365
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,930
will really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to think about</font>

366
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,030
but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no real protection</font>

367
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,219
mechanisms for this one's right because

368
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,829
it's a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> request it's a normal</font>

369
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,290
application request I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask your web</font>

370
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,500
server to do something and web server

371
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,709
does it because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was why I what I</font>

372
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:32,070
asked it to you so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really really</font>

373
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:34,110
need to analyze your environment another

374
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,640
one and it's again a simple solution

375
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,230
that's why you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your application to</font>

376
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">reconnoitre so you have your proxy in</font>

377
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,080
between this proxy can actually offload

378
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">SSL and this is where you can control</font>

379
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,900
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL also this is where you can</font>

380
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:54,240
actually implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML protection this</font>

381
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:56,430
is the area where your valve we can be

382
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,410
used for your denial of service

383
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,660
protection web application firewall can

384
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,520
be useful why if you go if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

385
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and say you see here XML DTD attack</font>

386
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,040
there is no denial of service solution

387
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,920
that will detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attack only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

388
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,599
application firewall well right so your

389
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,310
wife combined with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things will</font>

390
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,129
actually help you and this is where

391
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">people don't think well if you have a</font>

392
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,480
vow that's another tool for you because

393
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">it prevents these types of attacks in</font>

394
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,460
the next type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attacks which is</font>

395
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,780
vulnerability types of attacks so we

396
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,150
want a billet the abuse attacks right

397
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,280
we're ability abuse attacks are the one

398
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,370
is that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop good</font>

399
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:42,450
application code for and that's I think

400
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:45,449
we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this the reason the recent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> +</font>

401
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,760
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> plesk is web performance</font>

402
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,590
measuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool I know it's free open</font>

403
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,450
source well they had a zero-day

404
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,129
vulnerability very actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

405
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,310
issue why a PHP screen

406
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:01,060
a system command right so it was really

407
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,530
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good anyway this is something</font>

408
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to protect from and this</font>

409
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,629
is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> your web application firewall</font>

410
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,430
is getting the place so if you use a

411
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,050
scanner developing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> whitehead</font>

412
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,900
application scanner scan your

413
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,870
application use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> valve to protect</font>

414
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,470
you against denial of service it sounds

415
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,689
contradictory but it's true right

416
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,670
attacks such as a particular if you

417
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,340
don't protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with your web</font>

418
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,680
application firewall there is no way you

419
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,480
can protect it and yet the purpose of

420
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,990
that attack is just to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> down your</font>

421
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:39,670
web server so we have done this for

422
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,670
distributed denial of i call it Triple D

423
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,620
or blended denial of service attacks you

424
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,320
have to develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection for all four</font>

425
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,270
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacks in a first place second</font>

426
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,129
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to develop a good detection</font>

427
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,020
mechanism and third you have to have a

428
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,850
good incident management process once

429
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,580
you detect it you really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

430
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,649
need to have a good alerting and stuff

431
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,649
this is where Ava's practices are coming

432
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,590
into a play big time make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

433
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:07,540
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> are their business IT vendors</font>

434
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:12,010
every vendor should be there and should

435
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:14,379
be helping you so out of all these talks

436
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:17,140
let's do some like stepping back and

437
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,880
looking at what we talked about so for

438
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,590
volumetric attacks you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them</font>

439
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,860
out there you want to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> them at the</font>

440
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:28,540
perimeter right as far as you can from

441
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,179
your pipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> on isp dose is a service rate</font>

442
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,530
limit bgp redirect any tool that you can

443
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:39,430
use there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good however this this guy</font>

444
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:43,540
here must be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle first 10-15</font>

445
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:46,930
minutes of the load before your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dose as</font>

446
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:49,120
a service kicks in this firewall has to

447
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,100
handle the load right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

448
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to measure and</font>

449
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,149
properly architect for and the other

450
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,340
side is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your in inland house internal in</font>

451
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:02,830
your data center and you see three types

452
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,050
of attacks we have here stateful verse

453
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,580
for slow low and slow slower is low post

454
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,919
those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks these</font>

455
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,449
computational such as

456
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,760
negotiation and vulnerability such as a

457
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular right those types of attacks</font>

458
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,110
are something that you really really

459
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to protect within your organization</font>

460
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,399
so make sure that you have a proxy

461
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,020
firewall of some sort or use your

462
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,020
application delivery controller whatever

463
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:29,160
it is to tune the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's do the</font>

464
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,690
ssl offload make sure that you do the

465
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,150
have a capability to address zero days

466
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,370
as attack to address vulnerabilities

467
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,790
skin your applications it sounds funny

468
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,290
but for vulnerability denial of service

469
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not looking I might be entering</font>

470
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,830
sequel injection but not to steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

471
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:47,260
data but just to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> down your server</font>

472
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,389
right and that's something that people

473
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,700
don't often think about so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

474
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,370
have at the back y que shins and stop so

475
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,809
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your total protection if you</font>

476
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,729
have all these all four of these I

477
00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:01,360
warrant you you won't get any problems

478
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:05,170
with any any dos attack for sure but if

479
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,090
one of these is is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine-tuned you're</font>

480
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:12,820
going to get screwed<font color="#CCCCCC"> big-time so</font>

481
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,639
incident process management for ultimate

482
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,960
denial of service protection again

483
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,760
standard process people process

484
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,380
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to bug you much</font>

485
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,610
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

486
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,100
really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have for denial of</font>

487
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,399
service protection so we talked about

488
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,169
types of attacks we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

489
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the best architecture</font>

490
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,730
now we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about lessons</font>

491
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,970
learned what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we learn from our</font>

492
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,240
previous attacks in why I am I here to

493
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:43,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to you about what I've learned is a</font>

494
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,610
lot of vendors including my company will

495
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,790
tell you we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

496
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:51,540
not true actually I wonder why is that

497
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:54,190
not true but I've came across recently

498
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,139
guys that do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of denial of service</font>

499
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,620
as a service or content delivery

500
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,620
networks wanted to sell their solution

501
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,350
as a denial of service solution and if

502
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,189
you buy that solution this content

503
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,600
delivery network or IDPs solution you

504
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a problem with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three types of</font>

505
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,669
attacks and the attacks are listed here

506
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,679
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want me to get you more i can</font>

507
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,250
but these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones so</font>

508
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,160
your content

509
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,250
network as we said should help you

510
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,900
protect against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacks that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are out</font>

511
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,960
there in the perimeter why why is that

512
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,940
for every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these attacks here</font>

513
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,280
slow posts locate for this crafted URL

514
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,710
you have to understand every single

515
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,810
application session that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

516
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,750
problem when you're out there in the

517
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:49,480
cloud do you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of</font>

00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,760
the application in your data center of

course<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and if they tell you that</font>

520
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,820
they know they lie outright the same

resonance<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say LOL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 knows really</font>

well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect you against</font>

523
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,570
volumetric types of attacks no we don't

524
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so those are attached</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to things</font>

525
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,820
that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think about to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

526
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">about when you are designing your denial</font>

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,060
of service solution and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

528
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,190
types of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying</font>

529
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cover here in your general terms an</font>

530
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,600
approach where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the types of</font>

531
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,450
attacks and this is where you position

532
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,330
your defense mechanisms right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

533
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,330
don't care again the benefit of this is

534
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't care is it a new attack or an</font>

535
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,980
old attack there was a huge hooplah

536
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">December oh there is a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their jumper</font>

537
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,890
above a blonde what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> their chapter</font>

538
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:40,450
it's an HTTP flood attack period oh it's

539
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,250
a father tech do have those protection

540
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,290
out there yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

541
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,420
jumper version 2 or it's called

542
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,820
September or it's called dirt jumper I

543
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,260
don't care the target is the same I help

544
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,240
mechanisms that are built into my

545
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,940
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my apology they</font>

546
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,500
protect against that done right very

547
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:03,130
simple I can sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> at night them right</font>

548
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,830
also investing boats perimeter and on

549
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:09,070
premise if they tell you my perimeter

550
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:11,320
thing solves everything no builders

551
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,990
resilient tiered architecture make sure

552
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have tears frontier perimeter</font>

553
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,880
and back here at least mitigate layer 3

554
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> wherefore attacks with great shaping</font>

555
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">stat pool you know some flood control</font>

556
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:28,240
mitigate layer 7 attacks with secondary

557
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:31,120
tears so what what some of the guys that

558
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with we have done is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

559
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,590
have an application<font color="#E5E5E5"> it runs into today</font>

560
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,750
enters they got attacked what they

561
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,360
started to do is oh ok now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

562
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:44,090
use capture right it's an additional

563
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,059
control that weeds out botnets from a

564
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,730
real browser or real user right and you

565
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:52,100
can instigate it like this we're on your

566
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,510
web application firewall on your proxy

567
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,510
firewall on your application delivery

568
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,740
controller all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so see what</font>

569
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,660
you have in your infrastructure and

570
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,620
implement this it's a good simple

571
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:06,049
protection mechanism blacklist people

572
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use blacklist and this is</font>

573
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,549
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not really a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fan of I</font>

574
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:14,530
never recommend it this is only as a

575
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:18,049
last resort there is a stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like com</font>

576
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:19,309
web root cells pipe intelligence where

577
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,220
you can detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weather people are</font>

578
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:25,639
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine ten categories</font>

579
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,130
botnets a denial-of-service anonymous

580
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,230
proxy IP addresses and if you subscribe

581
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that database you can say oh now i am</font>

582
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,710
going to implement type intelligence

583
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,240
database when the attack starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's way</font>

584
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,549
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just creating your own blood</font>

585
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,320
list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which can eliminate a lot</font>

586
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:40,639
of users right and you want to serve

587
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,928
good users you don't want to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

588
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,320
search another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like</font>

589
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:47,870
to point here is don't do denial of

590
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,030
service test like this oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> take my</font>

591
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,010
laptop gets slow loris not PL script

592
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,809
from the internet I run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slow loris</font>

593
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,900
and then I check whether my general

00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">service screams oh it's so Laurie's</font>

595
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,100
guess what in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will never</font>

596
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,710
help you in real life what you need to

597
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">do is to simulate real-life generate the</font>

598
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,780
good traffic and then generate ton of

599
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,070
attacks towards your infrastructure and

600
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,080
see whether you can still browse your

601
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,879
own website because that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

602
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">III a success with you is can i browse</font>

605
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Laurie's right that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose</font>

606
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the purpose is I gotta serve my</font>

607
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,770
customers while I'm dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

608
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,600
attack right that's how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font>

609
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:34,910
testing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dose solutions so one part</font>

610
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,799
of the RAM book create your own Ram book

611
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:40,040
so what we've done at the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

612
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,168
was like and the septum 18 or 19 it was

613
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,428
like there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred people at every</font>

614
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,490
single bank and they were all looking

615
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:47,630
after everything today is like two or

616
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,790
three individuals

617
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,400
now attack is happening next<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tuesday we</font>

618
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,110
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and we have procedures we</font>

619
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
know what are we going to do we have

620
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,129
different controls that we put in place

621
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,399
either perimeter and stuff we tell our

622
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,170
isp hey you better<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch after this and</font>

623
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,440
stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was really really</font>

624
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:07,580
a really really good experience in today

625
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,480
what they are doing is essentially

626
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,699
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> process driven and really</font>

627
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,820
really ironed out make sure that you

628
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,130
have all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed in your RAM</font>

629
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,000
book or or you know guide how to protect

659
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:53,870
alliance it's sort of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the OS</font>

660
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:58,729
body there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial-of-service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

661
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:00,919
that is being studied up but please open

662
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:06,140
up an act today

663
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:09,100
as my my brother from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side the</font>

664
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,110
keynote said it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a game anymore</font>

665
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:15,590
when they attack you they know your

666
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:22,070
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have done the research what</font>

667
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:25,429
they can do on one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> banks has a</font>

668
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:29,960
capability to you can find where is the

669
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:32,840
closest ATM on their website but that

670
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,050
takes time and a lot of resources

671
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,330
because it's poorly written guess how

672
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:41,720
they cook got brought down sound was

673
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:45,260
searching for ATMs all over the world so

674
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,480
searching for a ATM in<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and the</font>

675
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,810
site was calculating where is the ATM in

676
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,790
China anyway just just so to like their

677
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:58,399
application logic things that you have

678
00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:02,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know think about so one thing is</font>

679
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want to test your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff oh it has</font>

680
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,429
a good tool and I think that this is a

681
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,810
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> older version 3.6 I think</font>

682
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:13,750
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a newer one so I have it on my</font>

683
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,450
laptop I was like okay let me check your

684
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,270
services whether they work really right

685
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:23,060
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really nice in handy tool</font>

686
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,820
there's a Noah's project security

687
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:31,310
ecosystem project after the bank's got

688
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:35,179
attack this body is sort of association

689
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:36,740
of all the big banks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> US and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

690
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,320
fortunate to get into the meeting but

691
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,410
it's a closed-door meeting and the

692
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,460
reason why we were invited was to see

693
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,780
which render they can blame so and it

694
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a closed-door meeting and they are</font>

695
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,040
still doing it closed door and I said to

696
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to them guys if it's a closed-door</font>

697
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,909
meeting you will never go anywhere

698
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,160
something like again the keynote guy

699
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,560
mentioned that you cannot provide input

700
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,650
because you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank or you're</font>

701
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,270
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a banker anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

702
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're champions we can make this happen</font>

703
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,980
right we can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do make this happen</font>

704
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,270
use these four categories it's really

705
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,220
going to help you build<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

706
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,330
architecture and I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also</font>

707
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,880
ray some stuff don't just attack people

708
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:23,720
with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptops ain't going to go well</font>

709
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:28,880
for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example and she</font>

710
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:31,760
she actually was freed but i just want

711
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,960
to point to this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you block the</font>

712
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,190
traffic on the street it's a

713
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,909
two-hundred-dollar fine and you spend

714
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:41,059
the night in jail if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you does someone on</font>

715
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:44,120
the internet you can end up in it will

716
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">be in a prison for 15 years something to</font>

717
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:51,049
think about but yet it's still happening

718
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:53,299
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you with this</font>

719
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:56,000
quote whenever you're fighting inside

720
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:59,780
the majority is time to pause and

721
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,059
reflect step back and say okay what am i

722
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,299
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong or am i doing something that</font>
