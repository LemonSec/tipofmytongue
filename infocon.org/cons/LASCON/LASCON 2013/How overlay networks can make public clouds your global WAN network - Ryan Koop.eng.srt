today give you a little background to

22

where we come from how we see the market

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,140

if there's such a law anymore but

00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:36,289
whatever talk about the costs of cloud

28
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,759
you know as opposed to physical as

29
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:40,130
opposed to a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago in the</font>

cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of stuff and then</font>

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,789
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what it takes to go for</font>

traditional land versus cloud win and

33
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:48,140
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have some people doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this today so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

we fit been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company since 2006 we</font>

49
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,230
be some transformative convergence there

50
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,890
that was going to impact the data center

51
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,149
we wanted to get

52
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,489
in on it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people started calling</font>

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,300
it cloud so we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing the cloud</font>

Palo Alto and then Belo Horizonte on in

57
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,790
Brazil what we do is when we say cloud

58
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about infrastructure as a</font>

59
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,720
service that's that's what we're going

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll give a</font>

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,950
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about infrastructure</font>

65
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,500
as a service and what we do we do cloud

66
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,200
networks and automation cloud networks

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,850
you'll see buzzword sdn up there I don't

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,570
know if anybody brought their buzzword

69
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,700
bingo card that we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that later</font>

70
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,200
but on the automation front in the cloud

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a little bit about image</font>

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:25,339
management how do i<font color="#CCCCCC"> get my servers to</font>

75
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,950
mainstream even your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom knows about it</font>

76
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,268
it's been in the Economist so stuff

77
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,100
reaches the Economist you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

78
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,440
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years too late but the good thing</font>

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,000
is prices keep going down so there's

80
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
some money to be made there if you

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,680
leverage it in the appropriate way now

82
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,810

as a cost mechanism SAS at the top

85

software as a service you'll probably

with some virtual container to plug your

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,620
app into and then it's highly scalable

102
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,740
it's really flexible and it works great

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,750
on these platforms as a service so force

104

107
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,640
guys essentially hit the same ones like

00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,710
Ruby on Rails PHP Java so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> forced</font>

Rails and started adding on different

114
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,960
frameworks and languages that you could

build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps with and then amazon web</font>

services they have elastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> beanstalk</font>

117
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,770
which is a competitor to these guys now

118
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,479
down at the bottom is what we're going

119
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,130
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about today and that's</font>

120
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,230
infrastructure as a service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

commoditize access to virtual compute

123
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,640
virtual storage and underlying network

124
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,190
capacity so they allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch a</font>

125
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,390
virtual machine in their cloud and then

126
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,540
you can run it and you can run whatever

127
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,120
you want on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top and the players in that</font>

128
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,730
I don't know if you guys have paid

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,730
attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartner there an analysts</font>

130

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,910
OpenStack is kind of the consortium

148
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,740
response to Amazon's market leadership

149
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,600
so a bunch of companies came in and said

150
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,750
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build the open open</font>

151
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,640
source cloud and that's OpenStack HP<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

152
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,460
building their cloud off of OpenStack

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,800
they actually have a OpenStack grizzly

154
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,469
coming out soon which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I</font>

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,240
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them a major competitor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,760
Amazon Rackspace also use a little

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,310
OpenStack and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows has</font>

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,030
a has a cloud to that they

159
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,910
not so recently allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux workloads</font>

160
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:11,929
to be launched in their cloud other than

161
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:14,360
windows were closed is it so i know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

162
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,270
this out but HP<font color="#E5E5E5"> has their grisly</font>

163
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,710
implementation in beta so when they flip

164
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,919
that out to all their regions that's

165
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,380
going to be an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to to see</font>

166
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,720
how it stacks up to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon</font>

167
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,370
VPC offering that you knows now that

168
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,440
default offering<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so i</font>

169
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,610
mentioned buzzword bingo excuse it for a

170
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,140
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i think it's good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

171
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,220
mention some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things before we</font>

172
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,200
jump into it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

173
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,380
little lot about the networking cloud

174
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,900
networking so we've always talked about

175
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it as overlay networking and we've been</font>

176
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,909
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about overlay networks for five</font>

177
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,620
years but what it is is when we say

178
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,240
overlay Network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess what we really</font>

179
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,920
mean is NF of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> function</font>

180
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,140
virtualization this is something that's

181
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,490
coming out in the cloud networking is

182
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,469
kind of the new hotness everyone's

183
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:04,550
talking about and it's the nice new

184
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:06,470
acronym<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what it is is its network</font>

185
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,470
functions independent from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware</font>

186
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,840
so its isolation between that virtual

187
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,190
network and the physical network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

188
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,989
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say overlay networks because</font>

189
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,950
you're building a virtual network on top

190
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,650
of a hardware network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're of</font>

191
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,280
course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization</font>

192
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,780
functionality means that you kind of

193
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,880
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in API so programmatic excuse</font>

194
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,159
me programmatic control over your

195
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,189
virtual network now the software-defined

196
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,710
networking that's a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzword as well</font>

197
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,620
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple billion dollar</font>

198
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,480
acquisition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nicira by VMware a couple</font>

199
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago so that really set off the</font>

200
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,530
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of SDN washing VMware what came out</font>

201
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,850
and spend a crapload of money on a

202
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,319
company that didn't have any customers

203
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">and was a bunch of academics from</font>

204
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,810
Stanford and everybody wanted to get a

205
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,810
piece of that pie so you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

206
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">of SDN stuff and and the key here is is</font>

207
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,589
Sdn is all about networks that can be

208
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured through an API and the</font>

209
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,100
distinction is is physical networks that

210
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,290
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured through an API and</font>

211
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,270
it's it's all about the separation

212
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">between what they call the control plane</font>

213
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,130
in the forwarding plane and it it

214
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,870
expresses different

215
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,520
and what's managing the network versus

216
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,300
how those packets move around the

217
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,680
network and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> spiegel more about how</font>

218
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,390
software-defined networking is being

219
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,189
used in the cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how NFV is being</font>

220
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:30,460
used in the cloud on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide when</font>

221
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,800
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a cloud stack you</font>

222
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,600
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as there's hardware then</font>

223
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,280
there's some virtualization technology

224
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,260
and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

225
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,140
actual users run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of that</font>

226
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,880
virtualization layer so we call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

227
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,890
application layer some people call it

228
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,110
like the cloud tenant layer or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

229
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,850
layer but it's whoever's consuming the

230
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,890
cloud that's where you're operating

231
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,110
you're launching your servers up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

232
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,900
application layer and the cloud provider

233
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,520
is providing access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that virtual</font>

234
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,740
computer storage and underlying

235
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,000
networking through the hardware layer

236
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,970
and virtual layer and there is a very

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,040
specific line that we call the limit of

238
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,860
access user control and visibility and

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,689
it means below that line it's everything

240
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the provider controls and above</font>

241
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that line it's everything that the user</font>

242
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,939
controls and generally the provider

243
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,370
doesn't care what you're running as long

244
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,380
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're operating within the TNCs</font>

245
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,240
you're not running some botnet or you're

246
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,830
not doing some malicious activities they

247
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,770
don't care what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing they don't</font>

248
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,840
care generally what you're running maybe

249
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,579
they have agreements with red hat and

250
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,020
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect some license</font>

00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,360
fees from you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but</font>

252
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,819
outside of that they don't care and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">flatten Network you don't care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

256
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:48,689
they're offering up that virtual compute

257
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,160
unit or that a gigabyte of storage

258
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,550
wherever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be as long as it's</font>

259
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,010
available it doesn't matter and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

260
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,740
some profound implications on how you go

261
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,930
about using the cloud so we caught talk

262
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,120
about cloud owner control application

263
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,900
under control and so back to the slide

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,330
about Sdn infrastructure Sdn is helping

265
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,030
that cloud provider offer up that fast

266
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,280
fat and flat network now at some point

267
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,810
there might be some open flow controls

268
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,120
that are offered<font color="#CCCCCC"> up through the user</font>

269
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,969
layer and allow you to control some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

270
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,870
the flow of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your packets at the moment</font>

271
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,089
there are none so<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now Sdn is used</font>

272
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,630
the provider to make their network more

273
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:34,660
scalable faster more easily consumed by

274
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:39,250
you the user and you up in the

275
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:42,430
application layer have to use NFV if you

276
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,160
want to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure deployment in the</font>

277
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,849
cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the clouds right now</font>

278
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is even in these VLAN isolations if you</font>

279
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,960
don't run some sort of encryption in

280
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,580
your data in motion all that data in

281
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,730
motion is plain text on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network</font>

282
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,890
now the cloud provider might be the

283
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,589
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-nine percent of</font>

00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,750
at regulated industry or not that your

295
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,099

297
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,820
controlling it so how do you do that you

298
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,240
do that with network function

299
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,940
virtualization here are some network

the cloud provider offers up edge

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,660
out there do their security white papers

329
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,530
and they do a really good job they

330
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,890
whatever the new SAS 70 is like SOC so

331

SC or whatever SOC<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and two whatever</font>

332
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:06,430
the certifications are the audits to say

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,370
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they got they have the</font>

there people can't bring in and out of

339
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:24,040
a really good job of that but you have

340
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,640
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of orthogonal lattice</font>

so in independent mechanisms that stack

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,710
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this lattice of multiple</font>

that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do in colo that's what</font>

346
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,520
you doin managed hosting why is the

347
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,930
cloud any different why should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font>

348
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,110
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know and you pay</font>

349
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,030
hourly more than someone who works for

350
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,760
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you vetted that that kind of</font>

351
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,130
thing so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

352
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,900
provider owned but they offer up some

353
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,730
controls and all clouds do this is

354
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,650
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hypervisor firewall rules so</font>

if you're familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon or HP</font>

the hypervisor level am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i going to let</font>

362
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,060
in to my instance and what am i going to

363
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,969
let out and you can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a</font>

364
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,430
user but then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other layers</font>

that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then apply this</font>

368
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,230
won't get on it too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> blues us you</font>

369
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,790
can do it via virtual network through

370
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,680
unique cryptographic keys and then

371
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,719
there's another network firewall that

372
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,670
you can control there and then down at

373
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual instance layer control your</font>

374
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:46,920
OS port filtering and then even encrypt

375
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:50,650
your disks for data at rest encryption

376
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,740
NFV allows you to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said federate</font>

377
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,329
across multiple clouds build hybrid

378
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,860
outs and do it in a way that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

379
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it forever we use all those skills</font>

380
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,990
we use all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those expertise use this</font>

381
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,420
industry standard ipsec tunneling use

382
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,060
the industry standard algorithms hashing

383
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,459
and diffie-hellman groups for your for

384
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:14,859
your tunnel negotiation nothing new all

385
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:17,740
the same stuff so who are the players

386
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,480
and that's unfortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

387
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned out to be like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a verizon map</font>

388
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,050
there's actually a world map in<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

389
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:28,300
behind this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think you can</font>

390
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:32,680
see so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> North America</font>

391
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,040
this is this is UK mainland Europe

392
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,459
Brazil that's the Arabian Peninsula<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

393
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,969
then he have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack over here probably</font>

394
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Singapore is the is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> highest density</font>

395
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,680
yeah so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Colo managed hosting</font>

396
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,270
locations these guys like equinox and

397
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,310
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know build their data</font>

398
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,260
centers globally and each each dot

399
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,260
represents a collection of data centers

400
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,400
more or less for the bigger players and

401
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,630
what I'm trying to express here is

402
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,880
there's a there's a global distribution

403
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,770
of these Colo guys and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

404
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,930
guys will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do kind of direct</font>

405
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:06,760
connect into any cloud provider so this

406
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,460
is kind of step<font color="#CCCCCC"> one if you want to pay</font>

407
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,589
on a more monthly to yearly contract put

408
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,110
some put some servers into samanage Colo

409
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,270
as a place to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start and then you can</font>

410
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:19,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">hook them into this which is another one</font>

411
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:23,349
of these this is public cloud locations

412
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,380
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup there's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia in</font>

413
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">the public cloud and all these dots all</font>

414
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,400
these companies on both of these slides

415
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:34,360
are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a North American</font>

416
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:37,840
perspective so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a there's kind</font>

417
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,479
of a dark zone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know china</font>

418
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,850
panda cloud india curry cloud russia

419
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,160
vodka cloud area that there are probably

420
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,070
some regional providers that play in

421
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,620
that space but looking at this from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

422
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,320
you know us point of view how can i

423
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,439
spread out through a US company and

424
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,780
subsidiaries of that so good global

425
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">distribution and I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know something</font>

426
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i wish i had some more time to do</font>

427
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,110
this and map it out kind of through time

428
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,570
how this stuff has come on in the last

429
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,219
like eight years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be pretty</font>

430
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,800
telling of how and where we're growing

431
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,800
because guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bringing up new regions</font>

432
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:18,280
all the time so the point here is the

433
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,530

communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other really well</font>

443

unfortunately was lost at sea but he

449
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,350
wrote a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really great things</font>

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,550
and what it went what the point of it

you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> less over network distance</font>

457
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,610
and the whole point is what does it cost

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,460
to build lands because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to start</font>

2008 equivalent of one mbps when what

link they decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was a hundred</font>

469
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,310
meg and then they put some updated

470
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,900
costing and so they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

471
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,370
numbers around cost performance and

472
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,260
improvement and the cool thing that they

473
00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,969
they did is where what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one dollar if</font>

474
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,030
we took one dollar what could we rent

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:11,350
how much could we rent one dollar worth

476
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:16,120
of this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh these metrics what does</font>

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:18,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">this cost us in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon in 2008</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

478
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,110
can see that you get some cost savings I

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,490
mean this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty early on Amazon and</font>

actually this 22

483
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,870
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think they're really looking at</font>

484
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,709
what a nice Amazon Elastic Compute unit

485
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,389
was but whatever it was getting close

486
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,090
cloud was getting pretty close to what

487
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:47,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could do in the physical world</font>

488
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:49,659
update it to 2013 it's pretty cost

489
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,720
effective to use cloud cloud has an

490
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,140
amazing cost driver here and you can see

491
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> savings percentages now i will say</font>

492
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:03,120
that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> went and got this number for the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">core device and when it got the lowest</font>

495
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:11,559
spot price so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest price</font>

496
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,200
you'd ever pay for that instance it

497
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,450
probably would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more but I like my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sixty-seven percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost savings number</font>

499
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,320
there so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> shootin for the for the</font>

500
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:27,070
marketing number but you know comes with

501
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">a comes of the caveat so cost is there</font>

502
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,059
but there there are a lot of other

503
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,820
drivers when you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and you're</font>

building connectivity how am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

505
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,570
do it maybe do a physical or am I going

506
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it using the cloud network</font>

washing is happening everywhere the

510

clouds the greatest thing that you know

00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,929
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you a fortune and get</font>

you fired from your job kind of thing

because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to bump up</font>

advocating that cloud when is the all

you know don't do don't build out

532

use case by use case basis you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

definitely organizational expertise if

you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card and go sign up</font>

and create accounts a couple minutes

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:06,070
you got a network kit I had this called

<font color="#CCCCCC">network compute but some people said</font>

622

that was that might be misleading but

623
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:14,409
you know network devices our computers

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:29,290
buy a refrigerator and find someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

they everyone says it's scalable we're

points of presence once you have that

00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:55,580
over that we had a bunch of leased lines

to a bunch of our customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also to</font>

they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> stitched this mesh together for</font>

you and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already including the</font>

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,049
price and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,240
economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scale it's already super</font>

699
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:33,309
discounted and you use your fractional

whatever you want without the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font>

pay by the hour pay by the pay by the

702
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:46,189
gigabyte so I want to get now into some

703
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:48,679
maybe some specific use cases how people

704
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,600
are using this now and what I really

705
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,460
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight here is some of them</font>

706
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,149
are in regulated industries some of them

707
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,769
are not one of them is in like I said in

708
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,268
African did this in Africa where there

709
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:02,330
really isn't any cloud structure there

710
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:04,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has been kind of piggybacking off</font>

711
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,740
of some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AMIA clouds then dropped</font>

712
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:12,189
down an African come back out so there's

713
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:15,260
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of options this one is a customer</font>

714
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,870
provides mobile banking software to a

715
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,000
number of banks and credit unions so not

716
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,320
the chase is not the tier ones but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

717
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,299
know maybe some of the smaller like

718
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,490
family credit unions and smaller banks

719
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:26,929
local banks that want to offer up those

720
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,600
mobile payment options those online

721
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:33,260
banking tools but don't want to build it

722
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,879
in house so they hire third party and

723
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way that this third party delivered</font>

724
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,260
is kind of hybrid software delivery

725
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,809
model traditional software delivery

726
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,970
where they ask for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know couple use</font>

727
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,908
in in Iraq inside the customers data

728
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:50,570
center but then also they built out a

729
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:52,070
bunch of it in the cloud so what they

730
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,799
needed to do is they needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a</font>

731
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">LAN between each server in the customers</font>

732
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,700
data center and their cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> win and some</font>

733
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:00,918
of the data on some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

734
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,399
in their kind of home network home data

735
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,470
center so they tried doing this at first

736
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,500
just hosting everything in u.s. west and

737
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,240
you know guys on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East Coast had you</font>

738
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,039
know really long latency performance

739
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,090
issues their customers were complaining

740
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,519
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spinning beachball kind of</font>

741
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,889
syndrome so then they started spreading

742
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,769
out there compute across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud and</font>

743
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:26,418
you know 350 customers that they have

744
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:27,620
they decide what we need to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

745
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,120
region this region this region this

746
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,129
region in this region then happens to be

747
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,189
across a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

748
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,620
clouds and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just extended that</font>

749
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,590
edge closer to their customers so they

750
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:44,560
can deliver their solutions more quickly

751
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:48,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and easily this is a security firm so</font>

752
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,800
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the bigger I didn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font>

access any management<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies out</font>

754
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,750
there similar deal you know they needed

755
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,610
global points of presence they needed to

756
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,400
to get right up to the edge of their

757
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,949
customers so that they could hook in and

758
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,350
they could get the get the solutions

759
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:08,080
quickly and easily and the the key here

760
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,969
is you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudland great but coming</font>

761
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,949
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security company this was where</font>

762
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,100
they really put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> that lattice</font>

763
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,170
themselves and really created this

764
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,030
extremely robust cloud deployment that I

765
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,010
would say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> more secure than</font>

766
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-nine point nine percent of the</font>

767
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,910
enterprise data centers out there they

768
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,790
have complete control over it they have

769
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:31,030

771
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:38,530
stuff at intrusion extrusion detection

772
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:40,660
really robust deployment because that's

773
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,889
the business there in and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> SL</font>

again regulated industry connecting down

to medical offices hospitals and back

lot of experience in Africa SMS is a big

788
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,510
thing down there most cell communication

789
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:28,510
is done SMS most advertisement because

790

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to reach a broad base</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

people between countries there's a lot

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:38,620
of advertisements pushed via SMS and

793
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,930
these guys offer essentially they're

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're an SMS bridge because you have</font>

795
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:43,549

<font color="#E5E5E5">commune</font>

797

occasions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commission in Nigeria there's</font>

798
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:49,519
a communications commission in Ghana

799
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:53,029
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications commission in</font>

800
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,749
Uganda and so on and they regulate their

801
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:58,730
industry and as a result the telcos you

802
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:01,330
know end up siloing off a little bit and

803
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,039
so endure communication between say

804
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,980
visit phone and Airtel over an SMS

805
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,739
network you should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible until</font>

806
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:13,099
this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> came along and offers up the</font>

807
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:16,638
SMS bridge both for users so that you

808
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:21,169
know I on airtel Ghana can text my buddy

809
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,460
on visit own over in Nigeria seems you

810
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:25,460
know something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we might take for</font>

811
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,440
granted but something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't</font>

812
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,470
have before excuse me and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

813
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,599
thing is SMS advertisers can now plug

814
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:35,808
into this and shoot their advertisements

815
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,780
out over multiple telcos only targeting

816
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:40,549
one endpoint so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool use the</font>

817
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,290
cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public clouds are using</font>

818
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're using one of the dimension data</font>

819
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,399
clouds down in South Africa but then

820
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,369
they're shooting everything back up to

821
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,520
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EU just because they're there</font>

822
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:54,500
isn't much compute capacity down there

823
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,149
in Africa at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

824
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,059
opportunity if anybody's looking to you

825
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:03,259
know go out raise a bunch of capital and

826
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and build out some data center</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

827
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,210
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

828
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,670
talk about is what I think the real

829
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:15,559
value is to the cloud cloud network

830
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:17,690
backbone ready for us to consume i'm

831
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,579
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make get telco i'm going to be</font>

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,430
a telco except it's going to cost me

833
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">next to nothing and i'm going to control</font>

834
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,529
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> i decide who comes and who</font>

835
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:30,950
plays and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i build out this global</font>

836
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,660
distribution at my monthly cost i have

seven dollars a month<font color="#CCCCCC"> vir to build that</font>

840
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:45,980
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I think you'd be over a</font>

841
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,690
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quickly just if you</font>

842
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,339
wanted that space and actually the

843
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,220
compute that I'm running<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a million</font>

844
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:53,930
bucks in and data transfer and what this

845
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,540
allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and I'm just running a</font>

846
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:57,020
sip server in the cloud so I don't know

847
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody</font>

848
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:04,190
here's familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sip it's just a</font>

849
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:07,730
communications protocol anyway and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

850
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,140
connect in using actually using an SSL

851
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,890
tunnel on every phone because you can

852
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,960
load openvpn<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys and I</font>

853
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:17,060
i connect in and what it gives me is I

854
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,960
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> double encryption on my phone calls</font>

855
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,490
I signed my own certs I you can't

856
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,110
triangulate who I'm calling because I'm

857
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:29,450
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> private IP addresses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and private</font>

858
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:31,850
user names see I'm never referencing

859
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:34,520
another public IP or public phone number

860
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:37,339
from this so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is it's</font>

861
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,230
