yeah I'm a damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> cornell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the CTO at denim</font>

2
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,490
roof and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,740
challenge we've seen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

4
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,150
organizations we and really what that

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,629
challenge boils down to is we see a

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,519
whole lot of people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy scanners we</font>

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,050
see a lot fewer people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make very</font>

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,400
effective use of those scanners so we

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,199
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people that are buying a</font>

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,650
lot of technology whether it's a code

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,080
scanner or a nap scanner but then they

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get the you know after making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,010
technology investment they don't really

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much out of it so I wanted to talk</font>

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,910
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we've seen you know</font>

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,520
metrics you can use to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at your</font>

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,739
application portfolio and the assurance

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,480
activities that you're undertaking hope

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,640
we get the most out of the technology

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,209
that you're investing in in getting that

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of coverage for some reason terms</font>

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,830
of picture of me on the slide but with

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,600
much less hair I suppose I guess it's

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,110
almost time to go and get my semiannual

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,419
haircut but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm the founder and</font>

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,700
CTO at denim group and i'm a software

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,780
out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid to late 90s doing a lot</font>

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,660
of server side java stuff ecommerce and

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">java servlets and whatnot then in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,619
early 2000s did a bunch of work with

32
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:32,060
early net framework on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft</font>

33
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,709
side of the house but really for the

34
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,020
last eight or nine years what I've spent

35
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:38,420
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of my time in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my career</font>

36
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,300
doing is looking at how software

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,009
developers impact the security of the

38
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,069
organizations that are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

39
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,050
and deploying their software and so you

40
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I come as a software developer who</font>

41
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,039
is you know now focused on the world of

42
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,630
security as opposed to somebody with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

43
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:56,179
more traditional penetration testing

back penetration testing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audit</font>

45
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,720
background who's now looking at web and

46
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,759
mobile applications and that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,209
colors a lot of what a lot of what I say

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,450
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an automated scanner either</font>

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,180
a code scanner or an application scanner

60
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:42,170
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good almost almost</font>

61

excellent who here is happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their</font>

66

yes one person one and a half people for

68
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:14,310
the heavier their scanner I'm curious

69
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,269
why or why not why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half way</font>

70
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,269
happy with your scanner

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,540
a lot of noise comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Cannes</font>

72
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:33,709
anybody else why do you not love your

73
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:35,329
scanner as much as you could nobody know

74
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,980
what else to talk I don't I don't have

75
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,500
anything like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IBM and HP guys they</font>

76
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,760
can't hurt you don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if they only representative to</font>

78
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience Josh I think you said you</font>

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:04:01,959
liked<font color="#E5E5E5"> your scanner why why do you like</font>

80
00:03:45,020 --> 00:04:04,400
it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good excellent</font>

81
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:08,150
anybody else thoughts on why they do or

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,640
do not like your skin all right the

83
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:16,340
friday afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap and so the</font>

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,599
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I see with a lot of</font>

85
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,529
organizations and I think what Josh said

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,440
speaks to this and you know speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on</font>

87
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,809
the one side also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here on the on</font>

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,490
the other side a real challenge that we

89
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,710
see in a lot of organizations is they

90
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,680
they have a scanner but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

91
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,909
a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font>

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,500
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using that scanner</font>

93
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,690
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used on a regular basis</font>

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,520
that the results are appropriately tuned

95
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,380
and that when you find things with the

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,320
scanner they actually get driven through

97
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,050
to completion and there's again those

98
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,890
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a lot of steps but in</font>

99
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,510
organizations we've seen that have been

100
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,460
successful rolling out scanning

101
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,940
technologies we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

102
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,710
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the rollout not as</font>

103
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,780
you know not from the standpoint of okay

104
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,789
well we did our bake-off you know we

105
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,049
argue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor on pricing you</font>

106
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">know purchase were to finally went</font>

107
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,630
through they cut me a key sent it to me

108
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">I downloaded the scanner and loaded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

109
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,650
the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know scan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the heck out of</font>

110
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,990
everything I could find<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it was</font>

111
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,820
nearby out of my network emailed a

112
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,110
couple of 300 page PDF reports with

113
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,820
color graphs up to the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

114
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,290
is responsible for the apps and then

115
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,610
like a squirrel runs by the window or

116
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,390
there's an incident you've got to deal

117
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,160
with or it's time to update the

118
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,530
antivirus or something the scanner gets

119
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,260
like put off at the corner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see a</font>

120
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,969
lot of a lot of situations where the

121
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,500
scanners<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't get used which is</font>

122
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,030
really unfortunate you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know especially</font>

123
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,100
after you spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money on</font>

124
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,900
acquiring this technology and a year

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,510
goes past and your boss walks by and

126
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,950
says hey how's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah should I feel a</font>

127
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,659
whole lot more secure because we bought

128
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">a hundred thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars worth of XYZ</font>

129
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,460
scanner and the answer is well you

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,280
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a week after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I spend after I</font>

131
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,930
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like rescan everything and so you</font>

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,369
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the successful organizations tend</font>

133
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,090
to look at this more from a programmatic

134
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,740
standpoint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know again the</font>

135
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,409
typical goal is you want to reduce your

136
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk by reliably creating acceptable</font>

137
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,180
secure software and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

138
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,370
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in a security talk you've got</font>

139
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,500
to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigot or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e people process</font>

140
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,910
and technology reference the scanner in

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,930
this case is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology but you've</font>

142
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,280
also got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have people that know how to</font>

143
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,780

place that tells you when to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

145
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">what to do with that in the spirit of</font>

146
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,990
security talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and anybody have a good</font>

148
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,770
talked to Jim antico about this I like I

149
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start replacing I think that</font>

150
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,409
security people might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more</font>

151
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,180
done there might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more effective</font>

152
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,190
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their organizations if their talks</font>

153
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,340
were all based off of Dali Lama quotes

157
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,070
for a different for a different day but

158
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">what would you see across security</font>

159
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,870
programs is their kind of there's common

160
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,850
activities and one enumeration of these

161
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">activities is the open software</font>

162
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,200
assurance maturity model and this is an

163
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,179
open framework that is intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

164
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,090
organizations formulate and implement a

165
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,320
strategy for rolling out their software

166
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,200
assurance or their software security

167
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,840
program and we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of success</font>

168
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,580
using open Sam and a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,710
ways it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in and look at an</font>

170
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,830
organization to see what is the current

171
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">state of processes and practices that</font>

172
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,280
you have any given development team<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

173
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so let's use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a yardstick to</font>

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,929
measure how well a specific team is

175
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,910
doing you know it's very very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

176
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,820
that and it gives you an idea of here's

177
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,430
where we're at it can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really</font>

178
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,900
helpful to set a road map out so that

179
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,529
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well if I know where I'm</font>

180
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,989
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

181
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:40,049
using this as a yardstick what changes

182
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:43,469
do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make to my program and you</font>

183
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:44,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">know yeah a challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

184
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be able to fix everything</font>

185
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,509
overnight and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the way the</font>

186
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,829
world works overall that's the way that

187
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,749
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> works that's certainly the</font>

188
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:53,549
case when you're looking at Software

189
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:55,649
Assurance or software security programs

190
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:57,539
where you have to get folks both from

191
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:59,159
the you know coding world and the

192
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,589
security world sometimes the IT audit

193
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,169
world you've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them to work</font>

194
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,939
together and so we've also had a lot of

195
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:07,799
success laying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a road map sing well</font>

196
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,499
this is where at right now you know in

197
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:12,419
this next you know over the next quarter

198
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,009
what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on is getting our</font>

199
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,869
static analysis program where we feel

200
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,579
like it needs to be or over this next

201
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:19,859
quarter we really feel like we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

202
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:21,059
get blank and training under way for

203
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone and we need to start thinking</font>

204
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:25,619
about targeted training for certain

205
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,179
classes of developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the main</font>

206
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,189
website this is no loss project main

207
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:32,039
website is a dub dub dub open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam's org</font>

208
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:33,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's currently undergoing some some</font>

209
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,179
revisions right now which is though

210
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,128
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good you know Sam starts out</font>

211
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,718
with four different business functions

212
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,519
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the core activities that any</font>

213
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,039
organization that's performing software

214
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,689
security is going to are going to be

215
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,189
undertaking and so that's looking at

216
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:49,699
governance how are you structuring your

217
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:51,930
program what are the metrics around it

218
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,979
construction let's look at the steps

219
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,878
we're taking when we're building

220
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,470
software and how are we why after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

221
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,600
done building software should we expect

222
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,970
that that software has been built with

223
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,559
appropriate security looking at the

224
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,209
verification you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after we've built</font>

225
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,069
software what activities do we have in

226
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">place to go and test that software to</font>

227
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that we've been successful</font>

228
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,740
rolling out or building software with

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of security that we expected</font>

230
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,000
and finally deployment all right

231
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,470
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you once you build it you've</font>

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,790
got to deploy it and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

233
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to it when it's out in</font>

234
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,120
production you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know deal with potential</font>

235
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,480
incidents and vulnerabilities that are

236
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,939
identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the way each of these</font>

237
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,149
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> functions get broken down into</font>

238
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:34,679
specific security practices and so for

239
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,059
governance you see we've got strategy

240
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,170
and metrics you know what are the what

241
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,290
are the goals of the program and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font>

242
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,309
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure what we're you know what</font>

243
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,809
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in the program so that we</font>

244
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,819
can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a determination if we feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

245
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,279
we're successful or not policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

246
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,390
compliance you know for better for worse

247
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,610
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in a lot of case</font>

248
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:52,500
is worse you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know compliance is the</font>

249
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,470
driver for a lot of software security

250
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:00,080
activities how many folks here subject

251
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:02,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI excellent sarbanes-oxley HIPAA</font>

252
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,470
all kinds of fun stuff and would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

253
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:09,030
overall well I guess I've seen two

254
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,440
common cases you know we've I've seen

255
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,610
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases where organizations</font>

256
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,650
wouldn't be doing anything about

257
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">software security but because PCI</font>

258
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,959
mandates that you train<font color="#E5E5E5"> your developers</font>

259
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,010
and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> a penetration testing they train</font>

260
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,350
their developers and do penetration

261
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,550
testing how many folks have been spurred

262
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,960
to action by PCI the other challenge

263
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,050
that we see in a lot of cases is that

264
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,450
PCI comes in and sucks up all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oxygen</font>

265
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,560
out of the room right your PCI says

266
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,660
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to do all these different</font>

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,949
things once you go through and do all

268
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,230
those different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you find out</font>

269
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,380
is that like 107 percent of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> budget</font>

270
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,910
is gone and you know and you can't do

271
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you actually wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do to</font>

272
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:51,510
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and manage risk does anybody ever run</font>

273
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,339
of that problem so policy and compliance

274
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,710
is understanding you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

275
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,850
compliance requirements do you have and

276
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,760
what are the policies that your

277
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,320
organization has in place you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

278
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,480
drive you toward obeying the things you

279
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,860
need to do for compliance finally under

280
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">governance we have education and</font>

281
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,460
guidance I've always go to a computer

282

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,510
took a lot of those super cool when I

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in college and the only two times we</font>

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,380
talked about security were in a in the

289
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,939
in our graphics class when the question

290
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,160
was who could show the funniest x window

291
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,620
on the professor's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX workstation</font>

292
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,670
and in a systems administration class

293
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,460
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learned that we could tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

294
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,079
to port 25 and fake emails as if we were

295
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,620
professors that those are the only two

296
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">times we talked about security in a you</font>

297
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,940
know in what I consider to be a pretty

298
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">good education</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to vocational</font>

299
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,670
education to come out be a developer and

300
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,350
you know again<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security just wasn't</font>

301
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,479
something those discussed and so what

302
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:00,060
we're finding is aftermarket you have to

303
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">train developers about security because</font>

304
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,849
they don't you

305
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,250
don't typically learn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know during</font>

306
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the there the typical education most</font>

307
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,709
developers go through under<font color="#E5E5E5"> construction</font>

308
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,870
so when we're building software there's

309
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,969
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of areas where we need to pay</font>

310
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:17,410
attention threat analysis you know what

311
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,930
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an environment is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font>

312
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,029
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed out into and what</font>

313
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,699
sort of folks you know typically

314
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:26,740
malicious are we going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expect might</font>

315
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,630
take an interest in this software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

316
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,720
how mature are you as an organization of

317
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:33,790
looking at an understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> threat</font>

318
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,170
security requirements yo again if you

319
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't train developers how to build</font>

320
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,620
secure code you probably shouldn't

321
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,000
expect them to build secure code and

322
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,620
similarly if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't layout</font>

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,510
requirements for the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

324
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,670
software it's not really fair to expect

325
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,230
after everything said done that the

326
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,969
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

327
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,089
properties that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect so how mature</font>

328
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,550
is your organization laying out good

329
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,800
security requirements finally secure

330
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,199
architecture you know when you structure

331
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,790
your systems are you building them in

332
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,470
such a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you help to minimize</font>

333
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,730
your attack surface and to minimize the

334
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,930
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for introducing different</font>

335
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,100
types of weaknesses and vulnerabilities

336
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,109
on the verification side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and design</font>

337
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,760
review what steps you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place in</font>

338
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">your organization to review a design</font>

339
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,970
before it's approved again to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

340
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,279
that it's got appropriate security

341
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,020
controls let me look at code review and

342
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when we see code scanners start</font>

343
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,579
to get integrated as well as manual code

344
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,529
review how much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code base or</font>

345
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,000
code bases are you scanning you know how

346
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,430
thoroughly are you scanning them and are

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,170
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you under undertaking your</font>

348
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,120
manual assessment activities as well and

349
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,829
then looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at security testing this is</font>

350
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,200
where we see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dynamic scanning</font>

351
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,819
activities incorporated you know once

352
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,740
the software is up and running what sort

353
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,149
of testing are you doing to see you know

354
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,709
against the live software are you doing

355
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,220
to see if you were successful building

356
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:50,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">the software you want to do under</font>

357
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,089
deployment Sam looks at vulnerability

358
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,859
management you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when vulnerabilities</font>

359
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,600
are identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will be common</font>

360
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,930
sure your processes for running those

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,790
vulnerabilities through the through a

362
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,959
process to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a problem</font>

363
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,699
are we going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it what sort of</font>

364
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,630
countermeasures let's make the fix and

365
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,329
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pushed out in a</font>

366
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,890
production environment Harding how good

367
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your organization at taking the code</font>

368
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,220
you're developing and putting it on to

369
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,439
an infrastructure that's going to

370
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">support your security goals</font>

371
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,820
and finally operational enablement all

372
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,490
right you know once you deploy software

373
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,290
how how good of a position<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

374
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,660
your application operation folks into

375
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,910
you know in order to be able to actually

376
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,319
manage and track the security of the

377
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:33,900
security state of the system over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

378
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,430
each of those 12 practices gets broken

379
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,319
out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or actually four</font>

380
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,390
different levels 0 being we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

381
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,310
anything in this area and you can look

382
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">through open Sam but you know they do a</font>

383
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,989
good job of a reasonably good job of

384
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,250
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if your security</font>

385
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,560
program has these characteristics you

386
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">will you know fit into a level 1 level 2</font>

387
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,800
or level 3 with three being the most

388
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,750
mature and so I've found I've found

389
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,250
opens going to be a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good tool</font>

390
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,990
it's at a good level of granularity for

391
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,550
analyzing a team it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as anybody</font>

392
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,590
here had experience with capability

393
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,329
maturity model CMM CMMI stuff like that

394
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,120
did you feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a whole lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

395
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">value out of your out of the work you</font>

396
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,170
did with the other why unless you're a

397
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,020
consultant you're doing seen in my

398
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,160
evaluations you might not I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

399
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,069
a lot of organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

400
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,770
willingly embraced CNN by just because

401
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,540
it's so ornate it's so elaborate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

402
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,100
open Sam again<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 different areas to</font>

403
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,079
measure three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels for each</font>

404
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,840
of them that's a fairly it's at<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIT</font>

405
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:38,010
attractable level of detail you know in

406
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:40,440
practice and so what part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is scanning</font>

407
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:43,020
play looking at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall security</font>

408
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,730
program and so automated scanning as I

409
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,620
mentioned is both part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

410
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,690
testing and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> code review security</font>

411
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,600
practices within the verification

412
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,910
business function and this is a really

413
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,470
common starting point for a lot of

414
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,530
organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are embarking on some</font>

415
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,390
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a software security program it's</font>

416
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,040
a very natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing again hey I've got</font>

417
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,949
an application you know scan my

418
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:09,569
application and tell me if if we've got

419
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,070
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is wrong one huge red flag</font>

420
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found going around and</font>

421
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,280
talking to organizations we say what are

422
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you doing to ensure the security of your</font>

423
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,689
applications right if they say we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bought</font>

424
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,670
apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all right we bought web its</font>

425
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,070
back we bought for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire we bought XYZ</font>

426
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if we bought if the answer is what</font>

427
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,059
do you do for security is we bought a

428
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,549
scanner there's a hike or

429
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,049
collation in my experience is a high

430
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:32,819
correlation between having that

431
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,679
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finding out that the</font>

432
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:37,709

433
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:40,619
scanner is probably not in regular in

434
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,628
active use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again goes back to the</font>

435
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:44,249
the challenge that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

436
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,019
premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this or we talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

437
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:48,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning which is we see a lot of</font>

438
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,289
scanners being purchased but less

439
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:53,579
scanner usage here's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

440
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,098
anti-patterns we've seen for scanning

441
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,649
scanning programs there's the dude with

442
00:16:56,099 --> 00:17:00,599
the scanner approach is we're all aware

443
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,189
of women<font color="#E5E5E5"> and information security you'll</font>

444
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:04,619
all be thrilled to know that this can be

445
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,839
implemented as the lady with the scanner

446
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:09,299
approach it works it's it's equally

447
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,480
ineffective with both genders you know

448
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,618
but that's where again you go out and

449
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,939
purchase a scanner the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

450
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:16,319
scanner somebody runs around makes a

451
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,569
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of noise maybe not a nap or two</font>

452
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,279
over doing some scanning aggravates a

453
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,188
couple development teams with some nasty

454
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:27,839
emails and giant PDF documents and then

455
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:29,909
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens after that and again the</font>

456
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,860
challenge there is that you purchase a

457
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:33,269
scanner if somebody ran around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and used</font>

458
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,360
it but they use in a very tactical way

459
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,259
without thought to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

460
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,008
well how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to manage these</font>

461
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,090
vulnerabilities through resolution and

462
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,409
applications change over time you know

463
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because you scan something once</font>

464
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:48,090
doesn't mean that the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

465
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,700
that after new features get added after

466
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,379
your changes get made you know fixes and

467
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,940
things get applied you know this

468
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:56,939
scanning is not something you do once

469
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,070
and forget you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know similarly we see or</font>

470
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,360
some organizations say okay well we just

471
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,639
turn this over the cloud we bought a

472
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole bunch of cloud-based scanning with</font>

473
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:06,029
the challenge being they're not actually

474
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,619
going to see you know are the apps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

475
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:09,179
we have signed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for clouds game number</font>

476
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,699
one you know have we got the scanning

477
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,929
here turned on hope we provision this we

478
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,919
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have bought a hundred units have</font>

479
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,399
we actually got a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

480
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,649
scans being run you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and is the</font>

481
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:22,320
technology working appropriately right

482
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I look to see am I getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

483

coverage from the scans or do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

484
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,879
tweak something you know we took a look

485
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,619
at scanners you know a lot of times with

486
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:34,830
scanners you run into challenges where

487
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:36,299
you have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> missus either in breadth</font>

488
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,299
or in depth and so looking at your

489
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:42,389
program you know breadth this is

490
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">or when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand the entire</font>

491
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,229
attack surface of your organization you

492
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,119
don't know the entire portfolio of

493
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,799
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have and as a</font>

494
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,449
result you might be scanning some things

495
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,668
but you're not scanning others because

496
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,929
you don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there you</font>

497
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:56,009
know we also see problems where

498
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,330
applications don't get scanned

499
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,820
frequently enough again<font color="#CCCCCC"> add these</font>

500
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:03,449
applications change over time software

501
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,769
changes over time and in a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

502
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,629
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> following up scanning</font>

503
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:09,059
activities with future scanning you run

504
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:12,209
into problems we also see a lot of

505
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,399
challenges with you know depth mrs.

506
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,230
where you're you know where the scanners

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,230
missing parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application again</font>

it false negatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so you know</font>

you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you've run a scan but you</font>

518
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,939
missed half the application attack

surface you don't know if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

520
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,149
vulnerabilities there those are if there

521
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,549
are live vulnerabilities there you have

522
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,809
it false negatives you know you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

523
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,158
into problems with certain scanning

524
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,080
technologies where they have excessive

525
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,059
false positives and that's essentially a

526
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,070
denial of service against the security

527
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,859
analyst where if the scanner comes back

528
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,029
and says I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a million billion</font>

529
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,710
vulnerabilities you know if you have to

530
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,119
wade through all that data you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

531
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,619
through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them figure out like oh</font>

532
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,269
actually this is a you know five

533
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:05,158
examples of the same vulnerability or

534
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,690
this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of a vulnerability</font>

535
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know it's it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> false</font>

536
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,489
positive from the scanner you know that

537
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,600
makes your use of the scanner or that

538
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:16,519
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the value that you get at a</font>

scanner a lot less effective

540
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,810
we see also some organizations that have

541
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know some better patterns you know</font>

542
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,370
in some organizations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to</font>

543
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,780
do bread first scanning all right and

544
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,639
again you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scanning program here</font>

545
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,930
not a scanner but if you have an

546
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,970
organization that has a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

547
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,790
applications right that you never looked

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,430
at before you know you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">out really quickly for all the</font>

exposed do we have any really disgusting

00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,120
you know sequel injection or cross-site

553
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,950
scripting vulnerabilities the stuff that

554

<font color="#CCCCCC">are easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find easy to exploit you</font>

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,680
hanging out there you know that we need

00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">to address another approach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to do</font>

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,880
deeper assessments of critical

a combination of automated scanning

manual scan review and assessment you

563
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,930
know and again depending on the

systems where you have service level

agreements with important customers need

568
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,420
to ensure hey we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a high</font>

degree of confidence in the security

00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,200
these applications again or your concern

571
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,400
maybe you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,810
for software security and we're

concerned you know because our attack

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,550
to understand and this from folks on the

579
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,959
security side you have to have some

580
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,180
context of the development teams that

581
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,970
show you may or may not have yet but

582
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,750
scanning is a means to an end right it's

583
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the scan is not a activity that has</font>

584
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,890
a point in them itself the goal of

585
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,110
scanning or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing is to identify</font>

586
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,730
vulnerabilities but once you identify

587
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,260
those vulnerabilities you've got to

588
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually manage those vulnerabilities</font>

589
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,770
which means you've got to run them

590
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,629
through to conclusion so that's an

591
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,730
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand we see are</font>

592
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,640
too many environments we go into where

593
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll come in do testing blow stuff up</font>

594
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,790
you know provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report with</font>

595
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,920
recommendations come back a year later

596
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:20,360
do the same testing blow the same thing

597
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,830
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like you've known about this</font>

598
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,780
this is important stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're known</font>

599
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it for a year you know why haven't</font>

600
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,200
I have you do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

601
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,940
again that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to having your</font>

602
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,100
poor vulnerability management practices

603
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,810
in place so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're finding</font>

604
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
vulnerabilities as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

605
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,679
you're kicking up vulnerabilities as a

606
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,689
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing a bunch of scanning you</font>

607
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,800
know if nothing ever happens with those

608
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,510
vulnerabilities you haven't really

609
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,530
gotten a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of value out of the</font>

610
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:47,150
assurance activities that you undertake

611
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,639
so what goes into a successful scanning

612
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,230
program the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a solid</font>

613
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,810
understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization's</font>

614
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,650
attack surface and this is something

615
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:59,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is that is very very fun to be very</font>

616
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,940
important I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in very scary</font>

617
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,040
meetings where folks that work in the

618
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">same organization you know discover that</font>

619
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,700
their application portfolio is growing

620
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,350
by leaps and bounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we're to</font>

621
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,610
say okay well we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this application</font>

622
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,199
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the version that we stood</font>

623
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,969
up for this important customer oh no

624
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,440
that application has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> takedown no it</font>

625
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">hasn't i had to respond to an incident</font>

626
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,800
on that server a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

627
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,330
well now we have twice you only have two

628
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,740
applications up instead of one and

629
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,090
people go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table and you find</font>

630
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,620
more and more applications that got

631
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,330
stood up and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that never going to</font>

632
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,060
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up life and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

633
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:32,689
organizations you know nobody has a

634
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good handle on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the of what</font>

635
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,440
the organization's attack surface is

636
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,570
from a standpoint of what web software

637
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,830
and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems they have and things</font>

638
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">like mobile and things like the cloud</font>

639
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,639
have only made that worse does anybody

640
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,149
here feel like they've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good list</font>

641
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:55,820
of apps in their organization yeah let's

642
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">go congratulations nobody else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah you</font>

643
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,909
also need to have a realistic concept of

644
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,170
scanner effectiveness there's certain

645
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,060
vulnerabilities that a scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

646
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,860
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find in an automated way</font>

647
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,450
there's other classes of vulnerabilities

648
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,090
that automation is simply never going to

649
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,100
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find and you know usually I</font>

650
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,139
see that that breaks down<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

651
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,760
between coding flaws like sequel

652
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,770
injection cross-site scripting that

653
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,320
scanners both the code scanners both the

654
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,280
static and the dynamic scanners are

655
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,409
pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of cases of</font>

656
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,510
catching versus more design or

657
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,070
architecture oriented flaws the deal

658
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,110
with the business logic or the specific

659
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,700
requirements of a given application in

660
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the context</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Union which is to</font>

661
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,409
deploy

662
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,939
and so it's important understand you

663
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,340
know for this scanning that I'm doing

664
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this testing that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing what</font>

665
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,740
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> really getting out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that how</font>

666
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:44,840
through of insight do I have about the

667
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:48,559
application about the security state of

668
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,809
this particular application another

669
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,250
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for is a discipline</font>

670
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:55,158
history of scanning again as

671
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,990
applications change over time you need

672
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back and retest and maybe only</font>

673
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to retest parts of the application</font>

674
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,020
you know maybe for certain releases you

675
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,880
need to retest the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but</font>

676
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,740
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> these applications typically don't</font>

677
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,929
you know number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the attackers don't</font>

678
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,029
live in a vacuum or you know don't live

679
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,130
in a static environment new attack

680
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:15,049
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> through developed and so</font>

681
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,090
that's something to pay attention to but

682
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,679
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and more important</font>

683
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,449
in most situations applications change

684
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,730
over time and it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

685
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,320
sure that this is an ongoing activity

686
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,289
it's not a one-time activity but it's a

687
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,178
program of ongoing scanning now finally

688
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:33,110
the prioritization of your testing

689
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:35,090
efforts you know if everything is if

690
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,010
everything is important that nothing is

691
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,860
important right so if everything is

692
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,200
equally if everything every application

693
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,820
is a critical you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know then you might as</font>

694
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">well say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that every application is a low</font>

695
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,750
right you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to prioritize</font>

696
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,340
and unless somebody here works in an

697
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,440
organization with an infinite budget

698
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,449
infinite resources an infinite budget

699
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,380
for software assurance of testing you're

700
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,090
probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to make some</font>

701
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,039
trade-offs to determine which

702
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,539
applications are we going to look at in

703
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:01,908
a cursory fashion which ones are we

704
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:04,360
going to select for deeper for deeper

705
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:07,970
and more thorough assurance activities

706
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,770
and so you know what we see is a

707
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,990
progression a lot of organizations you

708
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,070
know looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you try to</font>

709
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,899
determine what is your software attack

710
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,830
surface you know so you start out with

711
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the software that you currently know</font>

712
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:21,110
about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> critical</font>

713
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,969
legacy systems you know notable web

714
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,620
applications these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the you know</font>

715
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:27,409
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the applications where a lot</font>

716
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,899
of value flows through it and so

717
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,880
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows about it you know your</font>

718
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:33,049
auditors again if it's subject to pci or

719
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,760
something your auditors were probably

720
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,679
hassling you about it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot</font>

721
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,230
of cases we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations that have</font>

722
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,760
your formal SLA s4 application

723
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,950
performance and security with group you

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,440
out in this journey there's everybody in

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,789
their head has a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas of yeah</font>

732
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,830
these are the applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

733
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:59,020
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know because these are the</font>

734
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,559
ones were a lot of attention or a lot of

735
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,270
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> is flowing through you know then</font>

736
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,799
organizations start to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out like</font>

737
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well let's figure out the rest of</font>

738
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web based systems that we have you</font>

739
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,570
know what are the different lines of

740
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,950
business that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have and what</font>

741
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,090
applications have they deployed in

742
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,700
support of whatever stuff they're doing

743
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,020
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> or what are the one off pieces of</font>

744
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,150
software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've developed to support</font>

745
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,309
some specific function that now actually

746
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,929
lives there why'd you<font color="#E5E5E5"> missus originally</font>

747
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:24,190
you may have forgot it was there the

748
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,179
line of business might have procured it

749
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,000
through some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a non-standard</font>

750
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:29,409
channel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in a lot of cases you</font>

751
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,210
know this problem gets infinitely harder

752
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,520
if you're if you're in an organization

753
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,720
that does a lot of mergers right<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

754
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,860
all of a sudden you're well we've got

755
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">our applications plus all the</font>

756
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,309
applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these maniacs you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

757
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:42,789
down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta have as well or whatever</font>

758
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:44,889
the particular situation is if you you

759
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">know push</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even further than that you</font>

760
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,159
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you need to start looking at</font>

761
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,049
the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> you bought from someone you</font>

762
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that speaks to the things Joe</font>

763
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:53,679
is talking about in the last session

764
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,270
talking about the software supply chain

765
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right it's not just the software</font>

766
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're developing you know it's the</font>

767
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:59,710
components the roll up into that as well

768
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:01,899
as the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're buying from other</font>

769
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,140
folks again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these done in</font>

770
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:07,000
support of line of business you know

771
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,030
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that support infrastructure and</font>

772
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,429
again you know why did you missin well a

773
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,320
lot of scanners only really work well on

774
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:16,419
web applications and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

775
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,559
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know you may not be</font>

776
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your client server</font>

777
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,309
applications or other things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

778
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:23,470
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoa oh I'm sure</font>

779
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:24,940
the vendor I'm sure the software vendor

780
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,770
has gone and done you know whatever

781
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,370
whatever due diligence they need to

782
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:32,260
before they sold me the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

783
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,510
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the last</font>

784
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,720
set of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see our mobile apps</font>

785
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">right you know the cloud now I love the</font>

786
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,570
cloud because now everybody with like a

787
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,340
five hundred dollar limit purchase card

788
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,629
is now their own is now their own

789
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,799
purchasing officer right everybody

790
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,330
everybody the credit card in your

791
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,030
organization is now their own purchasing

792
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:53,290
department yay come through a shadow IT

793
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:54,850
same thing with mobile applications you

794
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,178
know we see in a lot of cases these get

795
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:00,320
procured your non-traditional

796
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,399
channels mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the some group a</font>

797
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">line of business says you know it'd be</font>

798
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:04,518
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great for innovation if we had a</font>

799
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,019
mobile app that would do XYZ we could

800
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,779
really serve our customers well we can

801
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:10,639
build a lot of value if we if we had a

802
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,869
mobile app that did this and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

803
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,279
their IT department and the IT

804
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:14,720
department says sure we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get our</font>

805
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,159
developers on it they can start

806
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,450
gathering requirements in two years and

807
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can expect your software two years</font>

808
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,470
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all right where they go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

809
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,789
the security department and the security

810
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,379
person says whatever you're asking the

811
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:26,600
answer is no but you still need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill</font>

812
00:29:24,379 --> 00:29:30,889
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> these three forms for me right and</font>

813
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,289
so naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you know a spunky</font>

814
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:35,090
employee you know who likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

815
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">rewarded for accomplishing their goals</font>

816
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,178
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know then goes to find some offshore</font>

817
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,799
developers that are more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than happy to</font>

818
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:41,570
put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> some software can put it in</font>

819
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:43,279
the app store<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you you know and so</font>

820
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,980
you know what we see are with the cloud

821
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,749
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and and and with your</font>

822
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,269
kind of newer technologies like mobile

823
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:52,369
we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't get procured</font>

824
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:54,259
through the normal channels and so it's

825
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:56,269
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to your organization's</font>

826
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:59,539
attack surface and not even know about

827
00:29:56,269 --> 00:30:01,070
it and it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been</font>

828
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:03,019
interesting to me to see you know

829
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,539
different ways both technical and

830
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:07,909
non-technical that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

831
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:11,450
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these to find these things</font>

832
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:14,389
thursday a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start-up if they're called</font>

833
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:19,039
cloud ability and their their<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole deal</font>

834
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:21,649
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they help organizations optimize</font>

835
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,029
their cloud spin by going in and working

836
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,860
with our accounting department to figure

837
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:27,710
out like oh by the way do you know that

838
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys have 72 amazon AWS accounts</font>

839
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,669
maybe if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull those</font>

840
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:34,220
together you'd find that you heal a

841
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,019
better volume pricing or do you know

842
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have like 17 differences of</font>

843
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:40,999
your instances where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know sales</font>

844
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,379
force or whatever else<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so similarly</font>

845
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,850
you know non-technical means going

846
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,529
through and talking to disaster recovery

847
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,480
folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right hey what do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

848
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:48,619
disaster recovery plans for all right if

849
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,649
something's important enough to have a

850
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:52,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">disaster recovery plan probably</font>

851
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,639
important enough to think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

852
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,740
security of it and so you know that in

853
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:58,159
addition to using network scanning and

854
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,840
things like

855
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,110
to identify a web application on

856
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,209
different segments of the network and so

857
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,740
the you know the tax surface is really

858
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,440
like the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> officers journey is uh</font>

859
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,930
you know what's your insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

860
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,820
attack surface what's the what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

861
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,700
perception of the attack surface what

862
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,439
assets do you understand I'll make a

863
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,140
part of that attack surface and what

864
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,490
level of insight do you have into you

865
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,620
know those types of applications that

866
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">your organization has though so they</font>

867
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,649
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay web applications that's</font>

868
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,120
something we need to worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

869
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,410
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> server applications yeah that's</font>

870
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,330
probably something we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

871
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerned about as well desktop</font>

872
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,230
applications those may those probably

873
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,820
have a potentially have security

874
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,800
applications as well you know cloud

875
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,470
applications mobile applications so on

876
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,060
and so forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you see that oh</font>

877
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:46,370
hey well we have some discovery

878
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,840
activities we find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple you know we</font>

879
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:50,239
go and ask a couple people find some

880
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,320
more and over time we see as a

881
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,120
progression and once once you understand

882
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,490
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that expose you</font>

883
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,780
to a software risk and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have perfect</font>

884
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,540
inside and I believe they call that

885
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,170
enlightenment and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe anyone</font>

886
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:07,610
has ever reached that stage another

887
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,100
important thing and when we talk about

888
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,709
the depth of scanning you know if you

889
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,879
know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've seen this a lot of</font>

890
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,280
challenged in this with procurement

891
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,710
language all right when people are going

892
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and looking for testing services you</font>

893
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,610
know what are you actually getting when

894
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,560
you have you know when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an</font>

895
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,060
application test right because there's a

896
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could potentially go into</font>

897
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,169
that and it's important to understand

898
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,970
when you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

899
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,620
thoroughness of the testing that you're

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,740
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to understand which</font>

components of the available testing

902
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,950
types are out there that you've

903
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,320
undertaken<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know and again this</font>

904
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,580
you know for most organizations you're

905
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,080
looking at dynamic analysis force

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,230
look at automated application scanning

911
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,310
again great at finding certain technical

912
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:02,510
flaws in applications not great or

913
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:05,510
completely incapable in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases</font>

914
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:08,090
of finding your business logic type

flaws logic flaws in applications right

916
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:12,780
and that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be applied both to</font>

917
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:14,400
dynamic analysis as well as static

926
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,340
there's a lot of things there's a lot of

927
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,160
flaws that you can only find in cases

928
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:37,669
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are doing your manual code</font>

00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,820
you know a huge problem that we've seen

before<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past with folks is they'll</font>

or is this something where you were the

951
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,280
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important when you look</font>

952
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,960
at the testing that you're performing to

953
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,250
understand you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

954
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,830
components these are the activities that

<font color="#E5E5E5">went into this test and as a result I</font>

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:36,929
should expect that we have identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have found you know but</font>

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,460
whatever vulnerabilities you I should

important than<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing is important some</font>

962
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,810

00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:55,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and you know each organization is</font>

hey does this application touch

971

you store the results of different

assurance activities you can load in

1014
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,020
scans from a lot of the popular free and

you know from manual penetration testing

1019

threat modeling and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1020
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,560
you can start to store all the results

let you do as you track scanning over

1025
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,440
time so if I'm loading scans in overtime

1026
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,940
each time it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new scanned it dips</font>

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">can you can start to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start to</font>

1034
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,230
track some metrics on your program and

1035
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,390
so you no longer have a collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1036
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:36,600
unrelated assurance activities right

1037
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:39,000
I've got a I've got a drawer full of 300

page PDF printouts from all these scans

1041
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,430
a much more quantitative description or

1042
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,680
a quantitative discussion with the

1043
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:55,919
powers that be in your organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1044
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,200
go through a quick demo yesterday i was

1045
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,290
given demos another organization and my

1046
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,740
laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a hard crash right before my</font>

1047
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,720
demo started today my system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is running</font>

1048
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:12,500
really slow so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will turn</font>

1049
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:15,180
out well so when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> login to thread fix</font>

1050
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,040
you first see just a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a basic</font>

1051
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">dashboard that shows you you know some</font>

1052
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,300
trending over time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1053
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,830
vulnerabilities they show up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there go</font>

1054
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,270
away what's the level criticality and

1055
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,920
you also see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are the</font>

1056
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,170
applications that we have you order our

1057
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,670
top 10 or top 10 most vulnerable

1058
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,770
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a full 10</font>

1059
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,090
apps loaded in now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also see your</font>

1060
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,530
recent scans that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been uploaded you</font>

1061
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,830
can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> geomantic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh types of things</font>

1062
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> computer earlier and so there's</font>

1063
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,819
some collaboration capabilities in there

1064
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,820
oops

1065
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,910
it's a second because my laptop hates me

1066
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:59,160
today but then you can drill into the

1067
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,810
applications and as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start</font>

1068
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,640
to upload the results of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning</font>

1069
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,230
so if you're running apps can or

1070
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that and you're running</font>

1071
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,660
over time you can load all this data

1072
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,760
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one central location and start to</font>

1073
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,310
track what vulnerabilities you're

1074
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,900
identifying in these applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1075
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,670
and again as you start to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

1076
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,150
can track it over time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start</font>

1077
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see trending data so the advantage of</font>

1078
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,109
storing all this stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one place is</font>

1079
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:28,529
is again you can start to report on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1080
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:30,270
data and what we've seen is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1081
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,160
facilitates a much better conversation

1082
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,720
with management if you go to management

1083
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,009
and tell them you know software security

1084
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,990
is the thing I'm concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1085
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,540
week and cross-site scripting is scary

1086
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:43,470
right if you go to an energy company

1087
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,680
right and you go to their CFO<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're an</font>

1088
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,910
airline<font color="#E5E5E5"> company go to their CFO you say</font>

1089
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,140
cross-site scripting is scary what

1090
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,790
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hey every</font>

1091
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">time the price of the barrel will shifts</font>

1092
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,990
by a dollar I lose 20 million bucks a

1093
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,900
day that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary cross-site scripting is</font>

1094
00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:00,330
not scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right if you had an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> energy</font>

1095
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,650
company CEO or your risk management to

1096
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,029
say hey cross-site scripting is sagari

1097
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,440
they're going to come back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1098
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,210
gonna say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had</font>

1099
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,800
eight guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> kidnapped in Congo last week</font>

1100
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,720
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our guys got like eaten in</font>

1101
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,790
Papua New Guinea last year like that's

1102
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,618
scary yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we want to talk about</font>

1103
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,089
managing risk those are the risks are

1104
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:21,080
really impactful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my business that's</font>

1105
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:21,080
the stuff that were scared about no but

1106
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,700
so but a cool thing that you get when

1107
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:29,640
you start to track these gaming

1108
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,980
activities over time is that you can you

1109
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,720
can see hey what's the prevalence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1110
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,160
certain vulnerabilities right what

1111
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,020
percentage of those vulnerabilities have

1112
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,848
I fixed as ever to hear familiar with

1113
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,160
the reports either were both from

1114
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:43,230
whitehat security in bar code they're

1115
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,029
resting those<font color="#E5E5E5"> past exit yeah great stuff</font>

1116
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,349
right where you know they've looked over

1117
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,030
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning they've done and they</font>

1118
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:51,060
can talk about hey for this industry

1119
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,460
companies of this size you know we have

1120
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,599
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they see this much sequel</font>

1121
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,300
injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> this much cross-site scripting</font>

1122
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've fixed this percentage of the</font>

1123
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,130
critical or high vulnerabilities they've

1124
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,119
identified like really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool data</font>

1125
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,080
because what that lets you do as an

1126
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,740
organization's you can start to

1127
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,270
benchmark

1128
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,830
is that right if you've got a report

1129
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,390
like this it shows what are the

1130
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,920
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> types of vulnerability how</font>

1131
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,150
many have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found what are the percent</font>

1132
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fixed you know what's the</font>

1133
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,060
average age<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the remaining and what's</font>

1134
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,100
the average time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes me to close</font>

1135
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,600
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sudden that puts you in a</font>

1136
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,250
situation where you can start having a

1137
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,750
grown-up<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation with management</font>

1138
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,090
where you can say here's third party

1139
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,090
data about the state of the software

1140
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:30,240
security industry right you know as you

1141
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,980
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see peer organizations to us you</font>

1142
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,680
know fix vulnerabilities on average in

1143
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,720
50 days we're not fixing vulnera fixing

1144
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,490
vulnerabilities on average in 75 days

1145
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,140
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to</font>

1146
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:42,569
vote more effort to right we are falling

1147
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of step with our peers we need to</font>

1148
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,040
vote to devote more effort to this you

1149
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,660
know or you could say hey in industry it

1150
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,700
takes people 50 days to fix this you

1151
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,770
know I'm my team is fixing them in 25

1152
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,779
days clearly I deserve a bonus for my

1153
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,730
effective use of scarce resources yeah

1154
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:59,070
the I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> however you want the</font>

1155
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,540
statistics to lie you're more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

1156
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,220
welcome to use them you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know but the</font>

1157
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,320
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now you start to have</font>

1158
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,770
actual statistics you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start talking</font>

1159
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a quantitative way about how your</font>

1160
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,800
program is working and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much</font>

1161
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,270
more powerful discussion to have when

1162
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,650
you're trying to justify budget when

1163
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,910
you're trying to justify<font color="#CCCCCC"> headcount</font>

1164
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're when you're trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate</font>

1165
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,890
hey you spent a hundred thousand dollars

1166
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying technology XYZ you know as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1167
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:26,520
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've discovered this</font>

1168
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,410
many apps in our portfolio we've

1169
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,119
identified these vulnerabilities and now

1170
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,529
we've got and now we've managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1171
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually fix a lot of this stuff as well</font>

1172
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:36,660
and so that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know again</font>

1173
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,730
to speak in a quantitative manner<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1174
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,589
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in your organization</font>

1175
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how successful you've been and</font>

1176
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,920
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data to then go and justify</font>

1177
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,920
further activity

1178
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:58,280
and again that's a you know you can

1179
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,040
download that from google code the 1.2

1180
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:05,960
final release just came out last week

1181
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,700
two weeks ago yup so and closing the

1182
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,050
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps for improvement really</font>

1183
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,240
important to build your application

1184
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,430
portfolio too many organizations have no

1185
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,870
clue what their application attack

1186
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,120
surface looks like and you cannot

1187
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,069
reasonably expect that you're going to

1188
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to defend application attack</font>

1189
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,820
surface that you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know about</font>

1190
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you're really any sort of</font>

1191
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,910
assurance program to be considered an

1192
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,650
actual probe you've gotta know you've

1193
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to have at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least an idea of what</font>

1194
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,430
your attack service looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1195
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,050
it's important to characterize the

1196
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,970
effectiveness of the efforts that you've

1197
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,860
made to date what assurance activities

1198
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:40,009
have you undertaken what was the value

1199
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uploads you know then you</font>

1200
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,800
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a plan for coverage well</font>

1201
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,180
now that you know your attack surface

1202
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,370
you've got to have a plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font>

1203
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,560
you know if I have this level<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

1204
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:51,170
what can I reasonably expect to cover

1205
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,840
and you know for this coverage what

1206
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,730
depth of insight should I expect to to

1207
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,650
get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you've got to</font>

1208
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitor progress over time these aren't</font>

1209
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:00,800
the types of things you know is

1210
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:02,330
especially in a space like software

1211
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,680
security where you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1212
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:06,290
intersection of development team

1213
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">security teams IT audit teams you know</font>

1214
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,759
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those folks have to come together</font>

1215
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,110
and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about trade-offs between you</font>

1216
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,750
know cool fancy new features and

1217
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,730
functionality versus fixing old problems

1218
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,810
in addressing technical debt you know

1219
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,980
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that doesn't happen</font>

1220
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,870
overnight it's something that has to

1221
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen over time again which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

1222
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,440
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really valuable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

1223
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,690
to have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> trending and historical</font>

1224
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,340
data that you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the bug</font>

1225
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,900
tracking capabilities yeah and so one of

1226
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,310
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that i forgot</font>

1227
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question is hey we</font>

1228
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:35,630
have a one of the bug tracking

1229
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,680
capabilities we give like in thread fix

1230
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,240
what you can do is you can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1231
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,129
slice and dice your vulnerability data

1232
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,990
and ship it over to defect tracking

1233
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:44,690
systems and so if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scan</font>

1234
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:46,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">with 100 cross-site scripting results</font>

1235
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,310
right you probably want to get those in

1236
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,510
the hands of developers right so they'll

1237
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,710
actually fix them you probably don't

1238
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take 100 cross-site scripting</font>

1239
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,070
vulnerabilities and turn it into a

1240
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred bugs because in the QA manager</font>

1241
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:59,710
will murder you in the parking lot right

1242
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the that's just not how you know</font>

1243
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,380
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take more time to</font>

1244
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,560
administer the bugs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little to fix</font>

1245
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,880
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what you can do is you can</font>

1246
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,190
go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well let's break this up</font>

1247
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,450
into blocks of 15 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take all the</font>

1248
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,560
bugs in a certain part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your all the</font>

1249
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,200
vulnerability is a certain part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

1250
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,060
application make that a bug and so you

1251
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,740
can bundle the vulnerabilities up ship

1252
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:21,220
them over to defect tracking systems and

1253
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,839
then you know thrift fix pulls the

1254
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,359
defect tracking systems on<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ongoing</font>

1255
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:26,859
basis to identify when the developers

1256
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,119
say the bug status has changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1257
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:29,440
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see when the developers think</font>

1258
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:32,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they fix the problem to reach to</font>

1259
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,430
schedule a new scan and right now we

1260
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:38,349
have out-of-the-box integrations with

1261
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:41,410
bugzilla JIRA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft team</font>

1262
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:43,599
foundation server there's a cloud base

1263
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,368
there's a cloud-based bug tracker called

1264
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,070
version one that we also have tentative

1265
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:50,619
support for and there's a plug-in API so

1266
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:52,270
that if you if you have another bug

1267
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,440
tracker that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to use you</font>

1268
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:55,570
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just implement a Java class</font>

1269
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,800
there's like six or seven methods that

1270
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,290
you need to implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know give me a</font>

1271
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,109
session make above check a status and

1272
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,490
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the you know out</font>

1273
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the box we've got to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know kind</font>

1274
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">of three or four popular system</font>

1275
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,200
supported and then what we see is

1276
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,640
there's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long tail with</font>

1277
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,140
defect tracking systems that the

1278
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,029
different folks use and so we've tried

1279
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as easy as possible you know</font>

1280
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:17,230
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an example code on the project</font>

1281
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:21,880
wiki and things like that great great

1282
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:24,570
question times any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1283
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well thank you all very much</font>
