1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,840
let's see so just by a show of hands

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,970
who's ever done any<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap development</font>

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Greg okay like two and a half</font>

4
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right cool so let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see so you did</font>

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,809
the intro<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can probably skip most of</font>

6
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,670
that stuff the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts here so I</font>

7
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,800
write code sometimes it works most of

8
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,760
the time it really doesn't I think sixty

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,529
percent of the time would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,309
pretty generous they're usually never

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,280
works you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all that stuff I can</font>

12
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,930
skip right over that yes I guess New

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,100
York is just like people from Texas as

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,110
soon as we open our mouths you know

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,450
exactly where we're from so I say coffee

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,950
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear me say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coffeescript after</font>

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,989
it still know exactly why so let's talk

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:08,340
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap so phonegap lets you</font>

19
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,440
build cross-platform applications the

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,360
basic premise is that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an</font>

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,649
application in one place and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,970
it in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different place of course</font>

23
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,860
there's definitely some nuances we'll

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,210
talk about in terms of the portability

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,250
if you do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of what the</font>

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,479
framework already provides but

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,060
essentially phone get what you actually

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,679
access api's and capabilities of the

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,670
device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't generally be</font>

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,340
able to access<font color="#CCCCCC"> within a browser</font>

31
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,049
application so give to that native you

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,330
know touch and feel I'll not although

33
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,409
not performance you know which one you'd

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,810
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about people about you</font>

35
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,270
know native versus a you no<font color="#CCCCCC"> html5 web</font>

36
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,470
it's it's a religious debate but anyways

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,399
it gives you all those capabilities it

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,048
wouldn't generally have in a browser

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,380
world so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally use for the web</font>

40
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,000
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTML code javascript CSS so it</font>

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,589
makes it really appealing for you know

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,240
web developers to move over<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">mobile world because I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font>

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to learn anything new they could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,750
apply the same programmatic stuff that

46
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,640
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know how to do phonegap is</font>

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,710
actually pretty well supported by the

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,320
ways anybody actually have a webos phone

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,399
a palm pre or anything like that in here

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,078
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away a beer</font>

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,540
to anyone that actually still<font color="#CCCCCC"> had one of</font>

52
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:14,700
those but just to kind of ease the pain

53
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,900
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so maybe I'll figure out a</font>

54
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,250
way to give a beer away after I know

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,820
it's a little early but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's never too</font>

56
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,060
early to start right she probably turned

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,319
tweet that off but anyways it's it's

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,690
pretty well supported across all the

59
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:33,810
major mobile platforms so phone

60
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,960
you'll hear that and Apache Cordova you

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,880
somewhat interchangeably so adobe

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">acquired the company that built phonegap</font>

63
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,730
so a cord over became like the it's the

64
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,350
open source but they originally won't

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,090
they called it Apache call back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

66
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,920
guess that name was wasn't too popular

67
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,530
so they eventually moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap and</font>

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">cordova's names so what kind of use them</font>

69
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,990
interchangeably we're just going to call

70
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:06,359
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap just to kind of keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

71
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:07,920
simple ah sure I believed yeah there's

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,240
some some people that are over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe</font>

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,739
now is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> committed and everything</font>

74
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,680
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> still running the project yeah</font>

75
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,200
well don't like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> phonegap is so</font>

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,910
cordobas on 31 if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the most</font>

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,459
recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> like PhoneGap release it's still</font>

78
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,380
one to nine so it's 29 and 29 it's a few

79
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,380
versions behind the latest Cordova

80
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:28,440
releases so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually pretty</font>

81
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,299
popular wikipedia are their applications

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,370
all open source wikipedia is built with

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,160
it untapped for those of you beer

84
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,140
drinkers this<font color="#E5E5E5"> application here actually</font>

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,790
kind of pissed me<font color="#CCCCCC"> off cuz they reported</font>

86
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,220
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bugs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and months back they sat</font>

87
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">on it for about five months and then</font>

88
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,000
checked it recently like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use</font>

89
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,340
those as demos and they fix them so good

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,450
job guys but this application is great

91
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,739
like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to cheat on your spouse</font>

92
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,299
you know doing the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

93
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,459
that's the hardest way to get caught

94
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,050
right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing they tired</font>

95
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,850
everything's like you know how discreet

96
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,260
it is and then they even give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

97
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,910
ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that man style</font>

98
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,590
basically so you can you know throw that

99
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,760
mascot like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one ever know</font>

100
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,800
that was Batman by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I mean</font>

101
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">seriously um yeah huh anyway so yeah if</font>

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,519
you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

103
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,000
site whatever you do in your time is

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,160
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business there are other frameworks</font>

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,440
would also leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap so IBM</font>

106
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,330
worklight so steroids is a recent are

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,910
pretty recent one but their whole thing

108
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> performance so they use you know</font>

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,640
native stuff to do a lot of the view

110
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,650
stuff that you know gives you a little

111
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">speed up as opposed to doing it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

112
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,599
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 so let's talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess the</font>

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,630
meter why everybody's here is it secure

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,919
the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8-ball wants to know so out of</font>

115
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,630
the box really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do much for you</font>

116
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,159
compared to other

117
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,390
you know modern frameworks you know talk

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,760
about web framework so we talk about

119
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,669
rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> Django you know newer versions of</font>

120
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,810
spring you know asp.net-mvc there's all

121
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,460
these built-in things you know

122
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,380
outputting coding to see surf

123
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,729
protections like there's some common

124
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,870
controls that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> built in these</font>

125
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,000
frameworks we don't have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

126
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,260
them phonegap certainly hasn't done much

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,570
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff the advice that's</font>

128
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,120
available to developers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wiki is</font>

129
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,849
pretty atrocious so they give you

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,110
recommendations here how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix XSS who</font>

131
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,240
the pupal means that you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

132
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,490
nonce and a post is actually it's just

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">crap but in any event like this is the</font>

134
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,130
stuff that's out there so you have you

135
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,870
know developers have never done any

136
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,520
mobile development you know come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

137
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,530
web background or maybe they haven't

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,270
even done much web development but then

139
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,000
they go to work with phonegap logo great

140
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,919
i just use a post and I'm good the other

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,170
misconception that's up there talked

142
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">about reverse engineering so they tout</font>

143
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,120
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually harder to reverse</font>

144
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,250
engineer HTML and<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript than it is</font>

145
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,890
do you do it to like say you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java</font>

146
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,850
and objective-c totally bogus<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if</font>

147
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,250
you throw it through an intercepting

148
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,760
proxy you know there you go if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

149
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,740
actually unzip so on Android it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> apk</font>

150
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,280
right if you just unzip it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean all</font>

151
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,250
the web code is there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen so yeah</font>

152
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,059
not really good it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually does make it</font>

153
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,710
quite a bit easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse-engineer</font>

154
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,270
applications so let's see I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're</font>

155
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,380
in Texas so do we have any Cowboys fans

156
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,090
here all right whoo go Cowboys all right

157
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,000
so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of do a little</font>

158
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,669
comparison so<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap has a lot in</font>

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,220
common with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony Romo so get ready for</font>

160
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,810
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks so yeah good enough until</font>

161
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,130
the fourth quarter so anybody actually

162
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,320
watched that game or is it too soon to

163
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,670
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now maybe it was only</font>

164
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">person who i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually cheering when</font>

165
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,530
that happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was great typical</font>

166
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,390
Tony Romo right phonegap you know it's

167
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,340
it's decent it you know if you're

168
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,340
relying on the platform provided

169
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,140
features those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are those those</font>

170
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,549
things work it is expected but<font color="#E5E5E5"> phonegap</font>

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,990
itself doesn't really do much for you

172
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,490
and you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end you kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nip</font>

173
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,970
yourself in the butt if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't take</font>

174
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,320
those things into account so yeah we're

175
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not going to trash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap too</font>

176
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,070
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Romo's always fair game because</font>

177
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,400
he's a disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the most overrated</font>

178
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,169
quarterback in the history

179
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,549
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta you know so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know instead</font>

180
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">of just pointing out like you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

181
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,580
you know talks these days it's like

182
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,139
problem problem problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're actually</font>

183
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to you know try to put some</font>

184
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,919
solutions in place and actually fix

185
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,020
these things so we use a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

186
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,549
of the box thinking so maybe the Tony

187
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,799
Romo will try this maybe is kirill bit

188
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:20,180
better and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus pride</font>

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a little bit more in android so a</font>

190
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,979
lot of the concepts for android<font color="#CCCCCC"> and iOS</font>

191
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,139
somewhat redundant iOS actually there's

192
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,580
a few snags on the amber and

193
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,650
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't there in iOS</font>

194
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,969
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

195
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,679
implications a little more screwed so

196
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,789
we'll focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

197
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,250
cross reference where everything's I'm

198
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,590
little bit different for iOS and if you

199
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,880
use in webos which<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

200
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,880
good for you guys will move on from that

201
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so how does phonegap actually</font>

202
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,539
work and do all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> magical things</font>

203
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,039
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill does so no security talk</font>

204
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,490
would be complete without some kind of

205
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,870
cliche architecture picture so just

206
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,669
point things out so in the upper left

207
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,500
hand corner you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have your actual web</font>

208
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,180
code so this stuff could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know</font>

209
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,349
serve locally from the device so this

210
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,120
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually be served from the</font>

211
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,349
web but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any event you know that's</font>

212
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,789
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you would think of stuff load</font>

213
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,760
in a browser that's your web code and

214
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,260
that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer below it is the actual</font>

215
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,550
web view that it's actually loaded into

216
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:19,610
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cordova and forget they wrap the</font>

217
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,720
existing like web views initialize them

218
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,659
though their own things without turning

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript on local storage and those</font>

220
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,870
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish the different</font>

221
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,039
communication channels to actually be

222
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,889
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to the plugins so the</font>

223
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,330
plugins are really all the magic happens

224
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,760
so the plugins or what you call you know

225
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,529
via JavaScript and that can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

226
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,779
to all those native capabilities and you

227
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,950
can also roll your own as well and if

228
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,570
you go on it have I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there's</font>

229
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,760
tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different plugins that people</font>

230
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,140
have built some really cool stuff some

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,670
really scary stuff some really stupid

232
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,770
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what have a mix of all the</font>

233
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,540
above and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you know all</font>

234
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff get you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the stuff</font>

235
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,449
in the bottom which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a native</font>

236
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,450
capability of the device

237
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:13,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's all right so we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font>

238
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,770
of do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk-through of what the code</font>

239
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,000
looks like on Android and we'll just

240
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">discuss you know each of those pieces</font>

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,180
where you know there's actually some

242
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:24,069
attack surface you guys actually hear me

243
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:25,810
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good now okay so first off you</font>

244
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,700
have a configuration now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

245
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,410
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on both iOS and Android you</font>

246
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,530
have a configuration file rule stuff set

247
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,660
up so at the top you see the axis origin

248
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,209
that's actually use the white list which

249
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,280
domains can actually load web code in

250
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,810
your application that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

251
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,400
default setting there with an asterisk

252
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,989
can anybody guess the implications of

253
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,060
that that's turned on by default by

254
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,650
default it loads from local index at

255
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,930
HTML<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work from the web</font>

256
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,480
and you you know most applications do

257
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,040
pull close down from the web as well and

258
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,120
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a ton of plugins that are</font>

259
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,500
enabled by default which we'll talk

260
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,750
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about that more later you had</font>

261
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,020
the manifest file<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine Android so on I</font>

262
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,550
on iOS you don't have that so if you

263
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,530
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have permission to do a certain</font>

264
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,569
thing you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> request permission in</font>

265
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,949
a manifest so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

266
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">different permissions that are enabled</font>

267
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,920
by default when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

268
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,210
brand new phone gap project we have web

269
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,250
assets of course so we talked about

270
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,860
those that's well your<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript CSS</font>

271
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:31,240
your images or resources etc your

272
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,490
plugins this is kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font>

273
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,760
like so the plugins are going to extend

274
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cordova plug in class there's the</font>

275
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,290
execute method which is the main entry

276
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,540
point into your plugins so the action is

277
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,089
generally used than like like an if-else

278
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,250
kind of thing just basically you know if

279
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:52,240
that's the action set then I do ABCD

280
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,010
that's the find in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in and so</font>

281
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,740
you can also return from the plugins you

282
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,350
can return plugin results as an array of

283
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,420
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> binary data you can return you</font>

284
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,610
know Jason data you can actually return

285
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,160
stuff back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual web layer</font>

286
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,330
itself which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know part of the</font>

287
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">appeal so it interacts as i said in</font>

288
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,810
several different ways

289
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:16,269
first off is if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to load</font>

290
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,399
web page you know that's pretty much how

291
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:20,980
you get started<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

292
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,050
activity right there you extend droid

293
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,459
gap which<font color="#CCCCCC"> extend something else but in</font>

294
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,680
the end it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an activity wrap with</font>

295
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:31,119
a bunch of stuff initializes the webview

296
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,920
for you and the other way which this is

297
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,060
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if you read you know so</font>

298
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,469
they're trying to deprecate they only

299
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,018
use it in a few places<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a few</font>

300
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,100
different plugins but they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

301
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">get away from doing that apparently</font>

302
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,430
except they still use it in their core

303
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:44,829
plugins but this essentially much you

304
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,689
basically from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

305
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,949
directly back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> webview itself</font>

306
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:52,690
which can obviously be really really

307
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:54,189
dangerous so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the security</font>

308
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,600
feature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap gives you out the</font>

309
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,600
box they give you the ability to

310
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,920
whitelist URLs that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

311
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,920
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't crap you have the box</font>

312
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,620
so let's talk about just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the i</font>

313
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,319
guess the broader areas of focus a

314
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,730
couple broad areas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> phonegap you</font>

315
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:14,139
know has some considerations and things

316
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,769
you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to lock down out of the box</font>

317
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,910
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your applications so first off we</font>

318
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,139
hit on these a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we'll dig</font>

319
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,130
a little bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the insecure</font>

320
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,290
defaults soap starters that's what your

321
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,889
whitelist looks like just basically turn

322
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,050
everything on that's it it's easy right

323
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,230
go home folks so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

324
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:37,990
really bad so by default any app any you

325
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,050
know domain can load and execute you

326
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,370
know HTML as well as javascript in your

327
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,719
application because this is actually

328
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">within the main web view that gets</font>

329
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,010
loaded and slide that activity and it

330
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
just simply turn javascript on for

331
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,279
pretty much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know anything that's</font>

332
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,310
loaded so if you were to reload you know

333
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,000
the new domain you know new URL

334
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,279
everything has the ability to execute

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,010
JavaScript<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the box which</font>

336
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,019
depending on the plugins that you have

337
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,510
enabled can be really dead there's no

338
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,670
granular control over you know which

339
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,269
origins can potentially like mode and

340
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,610
execute stuff from plugin so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

341
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:17,560
on pretty much globally is an ugly thing

342
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:20,980
of times so permissions we touched on

343
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">these so it asks for a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

344
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,760
stuff

345
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm particularly the 16 permissions</font>

346
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,520
enabled by default and there's actually

347
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">three de that already been used so I</font>

348
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,670
thought it was nuts but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually went</font>

349
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and found that yeah there's just</font>

350
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,959
nowhere these reviews our receive SMS

351
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,579
our record audio record video they don't

352
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,939
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement them anywhere so</font>

353
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,880
they're just extraneous permissions good

354
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,120
job guys so we talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugins</font>

355
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,610
so we look at and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bounce to</font>

356
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,260
eclipse for a second by the way any

357
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,180
questions I know I'm just ripping from

358
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:03,550
contract does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any questions</font>

359
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:03,550
so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see</font>

360
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:18,630
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

361
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">directory we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML me at the configs</font>

362
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:27,220
load that up so you can see out of the

363
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,770
box I mean every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one of these</font>

364
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,350
plugins is enabled so the ability of

365
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:35,410
grip so much geolocation data the

366
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,840
contacts storage the storage plugins

367
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">great because that gives you pretty much</font>

368
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,060
especially the way it's implemented

369
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,680
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font>

370
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">its if you get exercise you pretty much</font>

371
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,849
have like a full sequel browser to

372
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,050
anything storm at device so when you

373
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,270
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like oh you know it's</font>

374
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,880
whatever there's no sandbox in place and

375
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,740
you know local file you know system is

376
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,300
encrypted that's great until you have

377
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">exercising you just pop that stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

378
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,170
of there anyway but in any event all

379
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,600
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is enabled by default at the</font>

380
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,709
bottom so more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mattamy if you</font>

381
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,810
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give up and just start kind of</font>

382
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,220
browsing around you'll notice that more

383
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,439
often than not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a maybe more than</font>

384
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,660
sixty percent of the time don't turn

385
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,920
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff off and you know more often</font>

386
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">than not they don't actually use half</font>

387
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:20,380
tools plugins anyway so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if</font>

388
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,120
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing or you reviewing an</font>

389
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,500
application you know definitely want to

390
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">match up to see if those plugins that</font>

391
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
are enabled or actually use in any way

392
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,400
because more often than not like you

393
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,400
said you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find they're not</font>

394
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,670
yeah because it's easier yeah and Pete

395
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,950
and warp developers are lazy I guess so

396
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah but I totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah it's it's</font>

397
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,640
it's crap show

398
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:51,869
um no so I've written some stuff and so

399
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,490
there's some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to you know</font>

400
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,220
possibly it'll push some pull requests

401
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,600
up to them for this has been a few blog

402
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,280
posts but not it's really not really

403
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">well documented which is shocking you</font>

404
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:08,339
know so getting back to it so exercise

405
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,600
is fun again so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do a lot of</font>

406
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,700
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these are the three primary</font>

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,500
ways that you can get you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> script</font>

408
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,540
and HTML execution in the application

409
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,060
the first is by you know serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> content</font>

410
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,890
so you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exercise book I</font>

411
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,449
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your knowledge about exercise</font>

412
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,819
is one hundred percent applicable here

413
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,860
so you have untrusted data gets rendered

414
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,780
back on the page page can't distinguish

415
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,110
between what's data woods code your code

416
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,020
fires you win the other way is through

417
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,260
the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin result so we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

418
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,480
quick look at that and actually let's

419
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,600
look at it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made some changes</font>

420
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,720
the one in Eclipse so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

421
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,540
one that's actually up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on github right</font>

422
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,870
now so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin</font>

423
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,870
result

424
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:01,810
so you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so this is going</font>

425
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get cold then a plug-in and when you</font>

426
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,938
want to return data within an accord ova

427
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,980
paulien you would do it through this and

428
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,309
this would you know fire off another

429
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,770
class this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of a contact</font>

430
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll call that context which has a</font>

431
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,970
channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shuttle stuff back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

432
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:22,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">view but as you can see nothing is</font>

433
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,679
encoded or altered by default so again

434
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,329
when you think about like frameworks

435
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
like you know rails what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doin</font>

436
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Django you know they're outputting</font>

437
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,700
coding stuff by default so I mean if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

438
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,950
put it you know within you know

439
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,210
something you know looking for then it's

440
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,980
sent back and at least it's at least do

441
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,330
an HTML encoding you know which

442
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,400
obviously doesn't fix all types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

443
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,799
exercise but<font color="#CCCCCC"> which fixes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a sub</font>

444
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,179
set by default so phonegap at this point

445
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,530
doesn't have any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff built in</font>

446
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:49,720
it's just basically what you see is what

447
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:52,780
you get back which is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty the</font>

448
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,270
other way to do this is through send

449
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript as we said so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a</font>

450
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:04,950
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick let's see this</font>

451
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,950
one shouldn't be manipulated

452
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:22,059
so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cordova webview so you have</font>

453
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,059
this ability here too

454
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,360
so this can be called from any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

455
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:37,429
plugins as well so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just</font>

456
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,139
essentially drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript on a cue</font>

457
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,750
that's going to get executed within the

458
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">webview so an example that would be</font>

459
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:49,039
within the storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in which still</font>

460
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:55,309
hasn't fully deprecated this so there's

461
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:57,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places where it's actually yeah so</font>

462
00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:00,678
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this as it gets sent back</font>

463
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,799
here so you basically essentially have a

464
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,020
piece of jas you can catenate some stuff

465
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:08,240
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their does that look pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

466
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys so that's you know how the</font>

467
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug-in basically send it back so you</font>

468
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,370
have messages you know the same way so

469
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,280
your message<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff gets thrown right</font>

470
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,289
into a piece of JavaScript as is so

471
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,789
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pretty dangerous things these</font>

472
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">are these are these are actually</font>

473
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:25,429
distributed with the framework as well

474
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,390
so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean like most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plugins</font>

475
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,669
have actually gotten away from using

476
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,980
that but this throw a handful that are

477
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:39,679
still using it if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing an</font>

478
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:41,059
application don't do it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way all</font>

479
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,830
right so yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

480
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,690
actually so nothing is outputting coded

481
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,789
by default so you're actually on the

482
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:51,110
hook for handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> net if you want to do it</font>

483
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:52,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">safely in addition to its you know it's</font>

484
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know web content you know</font>

485
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,700
for example if you're pulling

486
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,379
information from your plugins from you

487
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,630
know contact if you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS</font>

488
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,919
messages and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the content of</font>

489
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,929
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something with it you</font>

490
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,190
know passing up to the webview these are

491
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,659
all different sources that you have to

492
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,309
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> is untrusted data as well</font>

493
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,690
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you know</font>

494
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,470
what's actually being returned within

495
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser worst thing in terms of the</font>

496
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,049
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so obviously it's very</font>

497
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,929
dependent<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the plugins that you have</font>

498
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,580
enabled which you know kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes so</font>

499
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:21,230
it's basically you know turn it off if

500
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't need it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more you can</font>

501
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,220
reduce the attack surface and that

502
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,870
manner the better phonegap will so it

503
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,909
doesn't provide any mechanism so for

504
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,280
example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the storage plug-in</font>

505
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:33,380
enabled and you want to say hey I only

506
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,549
want code that serve locally from like

507
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,460
the file system to be able to access

508
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any granular access</font>

509
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,890
controls built in for that so

510
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,990
essentially you know third

511
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,730
site can call those same exact plugins

512
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,490
as well you have absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> no control</font>

513
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,080
either you turn those plugins on or you

514
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:55,650
turn off this there's no way between at

515
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:57,570
this point so what a think of will get

516
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,950
us and transport layer your things has

517
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:11,669
anybody any questions about all that

518
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:14,730
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I move on yes now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

519
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:20,000
show an example here brought up an

520
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:24,270
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you my demo that I guess</font>

521
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,880
nothing too cool but so here's a plug in

522
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,760
here and interest firms a script<font color="#E5E5E5"> tab</font>

523
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,830
within piece of JSON so returns the

524
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,410
plugin result is JSON object for Jason

525
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,770
already in there and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just start</font>

526
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it up in the emulator but net event from</font>

527
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:45,120
there it is actually returned and called

528
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:47,850
within index at<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTML so then index that</font>

529
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,370
HTML so even though the iframe in there

530
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> where she had</font>

531
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,440
let's see you look at the jack<font color="#CCCCCC"> jas for a</font>

532
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,320
second so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see inside of here we</font>

533
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,360
just call that back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're just using</font>

534
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">jQuery just to manipulate the Dom so we</font>

535
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,418
just basically get that back we do a

536
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,979
parched Jason on it and then we do an

537
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,440
append so we just append it right to the

538
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">button basically so it's untrusted data</font>

539
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,370
you know and it just gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown into</font>

540
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:30,370
the Dom so we'll see an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now</font>

541
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,780
yet by the way for anyone that doesn t

542
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,250
testing genymotion is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance</font>

543
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">is amazing some reason today just</font>

544
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:52,730
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't want to uh thanks</font>

545
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:54,290
uh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen emotions really fast so yeah</font>

546
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,910
they virtualized instead of emulate the

547
00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:00,010
performance is great just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

548
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason let's see I I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broke this</font>

549
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:12,080
or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yes I digs I I whitelisted</font>

550
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:14,000
and second oh there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so</font>

551
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,679
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of you know that</font>

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,860
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then that JSON just it was just</font>

553
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:25,790
as what you see is what you get there so

554
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:29,439
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> break my demo after all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

555
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:33,879
so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that form of one</font>

556
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay talk about transport by your issues</font>

557
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,040
so under normal conditions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as</font>

558
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,570
we expect to the HP<font color="#E5E5E5"> client if the</font>

559
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,659
certificate has any<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues it should</font>

560
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,040
break but then there's some other guests

561
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,730
little gotchas that aren't really well

562
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,450
documented which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll discuss so this</font>

563
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,350
one is this one's a gem right here so

564
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,760
anytime you see you know somebody

565
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">whining that you have the debuggable</font>

566
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,560
flag set you know the buckle turned on

567
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,670
and the manifest say okay whatever even

568
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,740
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> those issues you know people</font>

569
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,270
downplay<font color="#E5E5E5"> phonegap does something really</font>

570
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,260
nice to you were they if you had that

571
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:12,590
enabled they turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your SSL tracks</font>

572
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,870
so not really the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do um so</font>

573
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,040
that would be a recommendation like turn

574
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,879
that off and you actually deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

575
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:23,210
production there's really no easy way to

576
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,770
pin certificates because if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

577
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">using the cord over that dry out of the</font>

578
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:29,660
box you don't have low enough you know

579
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:33,140
level access of how the HP you know

580
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">klein actually works so there's one</font>

581
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,840
implementation out there this actually

582
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,330
available like if you look on phonegap

583
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,970
build this is one of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

584
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,379
featured plugins so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

585
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know suggestion that you attempt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

586
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">pin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or certificate of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course anybody</font>

587
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,100
let's see anyone can anyone take a guess

588
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,100
that what's the significance of if you

589
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,799
actually serve this

590
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,129
web initially so say you make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> call out</font>

591
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,110
right HTTPS connection or even HTTP you

592
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,850
pull this down this JavaScript what have

593
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:05,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you already broken at that point anyone</font>

594
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:07,289
trust you know I mean if you can

595
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">manipulate that you know in route and of</font>

596
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,650
course it also depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your level of</font>

597
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,970
paranoia right but you know the appeal

598
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,510
which certificate pinning is that you

599
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:18,809
know you put you basically you take you

600
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:21,179
to see a hey whoever's on the other end

601
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:23,549
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would expect that the pub key</font>

602
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,230
that I've put in place you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> matches</font>

603
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:27,270
up with their pride then it just all

604
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,280
handshakes and works but if you're

605
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,918
serving it up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this manner you pretty</font>

606
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">much breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the any of that trust so</font>

607
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see you know underneath the</font>

608
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,039
hood they you know just basically make

609
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,440
an HP call if it matches up then they

610
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">return success and if not the other part</font>

611
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,530
of the problem with this so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font>

612
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:47,010
that it's all depended upon using

613
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:49,049
callbacks so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they recommend</font>

614
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,210
using this is that when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

615
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,820
open developer calls that they check to

616
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,190
make sure that you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Civic it's</font>

617
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,270
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> match up and it's trusted and</font>

618
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,950
then they also expect you to actually

619
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,668
call that every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font>

620
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,169
subsequent HPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> coal so when you put an</font>

621
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,820
invitation like that in place and you

622
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:07,890
you know it's all dependent on how well

623
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">a develop implements it you setting them</font>

624
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,870
up for failure it just never works so

625
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:17,010
like I said they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it easy at</font>

626
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:18,418
all to do certificate pinning cool so

627
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,789
now we talked about everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

628
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,890
broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with in phonegap am i doing on</font>

629
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:27,570
time so we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

630
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:30,480
that's broken in phonegap back so let's

631
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,149
talk about ways to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

632
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">been working on just secure fork you</font>

633
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,120
know maybe they'll implement some of

634
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,220
these ideas what to push some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up</font>

635
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,389
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now just kind of dabbling with</font>

636
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,220
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff outside of what they're doing</font>

637
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:45,630
it's a fork of 29 which that's what

638
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,630
phone gets on now so we're just kind of

639
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:55,110
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that version so available</font>

640
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Android not a great i have a</font>

641
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:00,360
hate-hate thing with Objective C I hate

642
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,428
objective-c<font color="#E5E5E5"> and objective-c hates me so</font>

643
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,869
if anybody know Greg's and awesome

644
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,519
I always the volcom back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

645
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,840
handful of people if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody actually</font>

646
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,429
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on some of this stuff for</font>

647
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,279
iOS I'd be more than happy to share

648
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:15,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas with you but for now just working</font>

649
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,529
on a proof of concept for Android so it

650
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds fancy right what does it actually</font>

651
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:22,259
do so trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically take away the</font>

652
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,909
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gotchas out of the box so for</font>

653
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">example you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some things</font>

654
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,809
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so easy to solve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

655
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,429
insecure defaults there's no reason for

656
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:31,580
that right there should be to just be

657
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:34,080
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then turn it on as you need it</font>

658
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,749
so doesn't solve all<font color="#CCCCCC"> your security</font>

659
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,158
issues absolutely not you know nothing

660
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">solves all security issues you know</font>

661
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,970
there's no you know shining unicorn that

662
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:45,330
does it all if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody tells you that</font>

663
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,549
they fold it so things were<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

664
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now so turning off the insecure</font>

665
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:51,230
defaults there's no reason for that

666
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,909
stuff to be there so just basically

667
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,619
essential to work as a template so the

668
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:57,659
record<font color="#E5E5E5"> open library has some changes</font>

669
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:59,970
some tweaks in it and then you know you

670
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,200
basically pull it in as a template then

671
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,490
you jump all your stuff in there but

672
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,470
everything's already turned off at that

673
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,210
point the other option is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

674
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,220
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um so if you ever</font>

675
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,570
build the phonegap application there's

676
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,639
some build tools that come with it where

677
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,158
you create like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> templates so either</font>

678
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:15,600
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> just modify those slightly are more</font>

679
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,149
to just use it this way we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font>

680
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,668
them as a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do your magic on</font>

681
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:22,110
it so there's a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things</font>

682
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:24,389
actually so like things that are really

683
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,039
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix for example why isn't there</font>

684
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:28,469
any output encoding<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

685
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,169
plugins right that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it's</font>

686
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,759
all done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one central place it's done</font>

687
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manager the plug</font>

688
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,210
result rather you pull this up here

689
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,770
so we just added a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font>

690
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:56,160
and I lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all right so yeah nothing</font>

691
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,049
fancy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all so just added a few things</font>

692
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,370
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the regular configuration</font>

693
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:03,629
added security configuration so a few

694
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,010
classes that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

695
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,070
can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whitewoods classes that we</font>

696
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,330
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look at but then also look</font>

697
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,020
at the security configuration so for

698
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,909
each plug-in by default HTML coding is

699
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,530
enabled so if you don't actually

700
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,929
manually disable then you'll have been

701
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:20,850
coding out of the box which i think is

702
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,880
easy enough to do so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

703
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:26,280
watch javed encoded to do that so this

704
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,740
between you know that s a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pico verities</font>

705
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,600
library so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ended up that OS</font>

706
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">lakota was a little bit you know faster</font>

707
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,559
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know actually a small jar so it</font>

708
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,650
actually doesn't vote the size of your

709
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,090
APK as much so that's there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

710
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,860
nothing complicated about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

711
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply running it through new code and</font>

712
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,389
you break so many issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point</font>

713
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,059
let's see next up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being able</font>

714
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,400
to whitelist individual domains that can

715
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,080
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript so you might have seen</font>

716
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,510
like a content distribution domain or

717
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,250
maybe you pulling down images you know

718
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,650
and some things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

719
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,690
execute JavaScript right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's enabled</font>

720
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,549
globally right as we show before that

721
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,770
when those<font color="#CCCCCC"> webview instantiated</font>

722
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enabled so why can't you just</font>

723
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,690
basically manually say you know kind of

724
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,100
like how you do with no script you know

725
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of concept basically where you</font>

726
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,230
say these domains can execute scripts

727
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,580
but these domains can only load HTML you

728
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,280
know so you break some stuff in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

729
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:29,428
as well the TLS stuff so turned off

730
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,290
that's stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust all hosting so</font>

731
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:33,330
there's also an issue as well like if

732
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,379
you look at some of the plugins for

733
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,379
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file utils</font>

734
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm sorry family

735
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,120
yeah so we went ahead and basically so

736
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,760
there's a few plugins and this would be

737
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,290
you know how we'd recommend so you have

738
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,970
discrepancies like so some places you

739
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,590
might have they actually in this one

740
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,680
give you the develop of the ability via

741
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:28,740
JavaScript to turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> checks which</font>

742
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,300
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid so anyways like I guess my</font>

743
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,460
idea is that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easier if it's</font>

744
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,169
just basically on or<font color="#E5E5E5"> off type of thing I</font>

745
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,990
mean if you really need to disable on

746
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,160
our part plugin basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I'd imagine</font>

747
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,510
if you're using it in a dev environment

748
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,850
you need to want to turn it on the

749
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,200
turned off but so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically</font>

750
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,290
centralizing that control makes it

751
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:55,920
easier not to hang yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

752
00:31:46,290 --> 00:32:00,750
turned off within you see here so we got

753
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,500
that one and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also turned off</font>

754
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,809
from out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the place where the</font>

755
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,150
debuggable flag so that also follows the

756
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,379
same thing so there's one because

757
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,640
developers don't know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

758
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,530
happen so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail when</font>

759
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,600
they do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all follows the</font>

760
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:17,730
same setting as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so SSL is either</font>

761
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:20,010
enforced in or mon or all life so also

762
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">made it easy avi configuration to also</font>

763
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:27,660
pay no certificate and also pin<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

764
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,970
multiple domains as well so that's all

765
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,690
enabled within security configuration

766
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,760
file so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just simply add an additional</font>

767
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:38,070
configuration so here's a few things

768
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in there so you're able to put</font>

769
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:43,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key you can specify by</font>

770
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,270
domain and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on or off so</font>

771
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,500
kind of working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stuff with origin</font>

772
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,900
access that's that's not fully flushed

773
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,480
out yet but there's a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

774
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just going to keep adding features</font>

775
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,970
actually one idea which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually kind</font>

776
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,340
of sort of stole from Greg the way they

777
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,650
implement it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ads framework it's</font>

778
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,379
how to actually do in storage so just

779
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,850
implement a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapper for sequel cipher</font>

780
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,890
it's just really easy to do so basically

781
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,178
just drop it in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have you know</font>

782
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,370
instant encrypted storage in your

783
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,650
application it should be seamless

784
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,020
especially because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way sequel cipher</font>

785
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:14,370
works anybody's actually ever used it so

786
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much it follows the same syntax</font>

787
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,928
the only

788
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:19,629
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference is that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

789
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:21,249
specify you know an encryption key but

790
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:23,049
it's just easy enough to basically take

791
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:25,059
that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands developer I just rack</font>

792
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,830
right into the framework because most

793
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,428
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deb applications the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero file</font>

794
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:36,908
encryption or you know data protection

795
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:37,929
with a nap let's see here so that's kind

796
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:39,759
of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got that a little bit working</font>

797
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:41,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">i still have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on that a little</font>

798
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit one thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't totally</font>

799
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:46,359
figured out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody actually digs</font>

800
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:48,488
into this be happy to exchange ideas is

801
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:51,070
how to actually enforce you know origin

802
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:53,080
policies on a per<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin basis so like</font>

803
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you pass something them like they say</font>

804
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,830
and like be an iframe the current you

805
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">know way that actually passes in like</font>

806
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,710
the domain it'll actually take like the

807
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:02,080
document that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were around with like</font>

808
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,789
that you know the outer frame and stuff

809
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,639
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure out</font>

810
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,259
like a real clean way to pass that in

811
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,279
when that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

812
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,200
all them in the frame or something like

813
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes like a</font>

814
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,279
cross origin you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> request actually</font>

815
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,199
we try to call that so if anybody has

816
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,970
any ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take some look at</font>

817
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,230
this I'd be happy to you know bounce

818
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,299
ideas back and forth to kind of solve

819
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,799
that problem and if there's anything

820
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:25,440
specific to your environment or just

821
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:27,849
things you stumble<font color="#CCCCCC"> across and say hey</font>

822
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,260
you know let's basically right away and

823
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:30,339
you know let's make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

824
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,589
part of the framework to make this

825
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:34,299
easier as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well be happy that ace elite</font>

826
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:39,549
ache requests to implement things as

827
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:47,799
well let's see and that would be it

828
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:50,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks any questions yes so I I wonder he</font>

829
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:54,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">impression that phonegap produces output</font>

830
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:58,059
that's ready to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an app store</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

831
00:34:54,339 --> 00:35:00,009
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the Saudis hard cap are you</font>

832
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:01,750
hard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you producing output that</font>

833
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">can go into an app store it's ready for</font>

834
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">the app store or is it just uh yeah it's</font>

835
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">still so I mean it's still using the</font>

836
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,940
same you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only difference is</font>

837
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:11,440
some tweaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Cordova library you know</font>

838
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,020
added you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know an additional security</font>

839
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,099
API on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of that so essentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

840
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,009
should operate the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

841
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,470
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be you know really no</font>

842
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,490
performance hit or anything like that so

843
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,049
in terms of you know so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I</font>

844
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't say use this today like I'm</font>

845
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:27,880
still working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it it's definitely like</font>

846
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,600
got some bugs to flush out but yeah I

847
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean in the end</font>

848
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:43,089
should be able to deploy this to an app

849
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:44,350
store as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in the</font>

850
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,910
end like you'll see you know some

851
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,920
applications they take the you know the

852
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,810
way of that they you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they load a</font>

853
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,520
lot of resources locally you know still

854
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the HTML the jas there and stuff</font>

855
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,030
like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> most applications you know</font>

856
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:57,670
pull stuff down from the Webbys they go

857
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,140
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes just like Greg excited</font>

858
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhat a bit you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know sometimes you'll</font>

859
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,500
see the APK in a little bit might but

860
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,720
all that content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

861
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">served from the server side so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

862
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,439
that hybrid view of some stuffs native

863
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:13,090
some stuff is coming down from the web

864
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:18,520
so gives us job security min so any

865
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:26,260
other questions comments still gotta

866
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:34,290
push it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah um what else yes</font>

867
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:41,470
sir genymotion awesome awesome awesome

868
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">recommend it yes right here so it uses</font>

869
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,640
virtual box yeah just performance is

870
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,860
incredible compared to the emulated

871
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,629
truth of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emulator is a huge pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

872
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,010
the ass so like you know if you're doing

873
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">this stuff in a regular basis see the</font>

874
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:55,600
user device or use genymotion just avoid

875
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,610
the emulator it's just it's slow its

876
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:03,610
clunky I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a huge any of it</font>

877
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:05,470
yes what no free so yeah it was based on

878
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,030
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android was it android vm i think it</font>

879
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called before or and rhodium</font>

880
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,460
something like that but anyways yeah

881
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,129
it's uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to monetize</font>

882
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,320
services on top of it but the basic

883
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,940
usage and they have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMS for a</font>

884
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,140
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different uh you know common</font>

885
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,600
devices you know some like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nexus all</font>

886
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nexus devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the galaxy s4 I</font>

887
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,230
really do

888
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:46,570
yeah it's definitely recommended any

889
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:50,830
other questions yes Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prezi PR easy I</font>

890
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:52,300
yeah yeah it's just that some people go

891
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,100
overboard with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> prezzies where they</font>

892
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">just stuff spins and you just kind of</font>

893
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,580
like no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just about five minutes</font>

894
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,780
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so but yeah if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go over</font>

895
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the animation is actually pretty</font>

896
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,010
cool i find that it like it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

897
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:05,049
conversational and your presentations as

898
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:12,340
opposed to be like boom slide boom slide

899
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:19,860
I'm sorry so yeah it's PR easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i com any</font>

900
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:22,540
other questions yes home get project

901
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,640
daddy yeah you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> pullman you could</font>

902
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,250
pull in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cordova so it's basically most</font>

903
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it is tweets with in cordova so I'm</font>

904
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,570
like within<font color="#E5E5E5"> your project you'd have for</font>

905
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:35,440
example looking down here at this guy

906
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:37,060
you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you quit over that jar assume</font>

907
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,100
look for example so that's Cordova tests

908
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,810
I just built that but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> one event</font>

909
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has all the you know phonegap you</font>

910
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,560
know although so basically that the

911
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,750
tweaks are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual Cordova library</font>

912
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,960
itself and then pushing that into a

913
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,220
project yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the next part</font>

914
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,320
will probably be you know to actually

915
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,060
modify you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default build</font>

916
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,440
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box so it actually turns all</font>

917
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,600
that stuff up but for now just basically

918
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,369
going to provide it as you know a

919
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,930
template it's got the library in there

920
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:08,880
just drop it in start<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing your web</font>

921
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:12,180
code and you should be okay anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

922
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,180
five minutes

923
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:23,019
um yes I guess it's no so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

924
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:27,459
like you know Facebook got away from

925
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:28,660
html5 win thing got away from html5 but

926
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,799
then you started seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this this</font>

927
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">framework sort of being built around</font>

928
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:32,559
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

929
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:35,499
balance out like the performance with

930
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,269
like the ease so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term I mean</font>

931
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:40,058
I think html5 is going to be it's going

932
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:41,769
to do well but is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you going</font>

933
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,999
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean I wouldn't say html5</font>

934
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:45,609
you know especially I mean you look like

935
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:47,890
Firefox OS I mean you know it's somewhat

936
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:49,390
the future I guess but you can't write

937
00:39:47,890 --> 00:40:07,808
native off yet I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> NATO is not going</font>

938
00:39:49,390 --> 00:40:22,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">anywhere anytime soon anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else like</font>

939
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:23,799
you mean they started yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

940
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:25,209
would hope they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with a communal you</font>

941
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,130
know I mean so they patch I guess you

942
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:28,509
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues there was a an issue with</font>

943
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,549
like PhoneGap build they patched you

944
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,440
know actually I gotta look cuz like the

945
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:33,489
issue was closed and then they reopened

946
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,329
it cuz it wasn't fixed and I haven't

947
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looked to see if they actually</font>

948
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:37,869
fix that so I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do a</font>

949
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,059
decent job of that stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

950
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:43,769
building into the framework babalu

951
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:43,769
absolutely so much anxiety at spoint

952
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,670
know so that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things action</font>

953
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,459
kind of using the same approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg</font>

954
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,839
used for his framework to do something

955
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:58,180
similar that you just have that inherent

956
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,430
control on the box<font color="#CCCCCC"> but now short answer</font>

957
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,779
is now including html5 local storage and

958
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,299
stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stored in the</font>

959
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:05,469
sequel right DB and then file storage as

960
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:06,699
well because you can also store file

961
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:09,519
share preferences and stuff like that

962
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:11,140
and the same thing obviously so there is

963
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">a keychain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is there are few key</font>

964
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,759
chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for iOS but for Android</font>

965
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:16,900
yeah not much but there is some stuff to

966
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:19,869
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in the keychain but then of</font>

967
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,789
course if you can write<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the keychain</font>

968
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:23,050
so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that calls</font>

969
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:24,940
plug-in on iOS

970
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,320
you know does stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain then</font>

971
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,180
obviously you can also pull stuff out

972
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keychain where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ex's us as well</font>

973
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,080
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one of the beautiful</font>

974
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,390
things that like you know people always

975
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,710
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that's great that's a</font>

976
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,910
problem but how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get to</font>

977
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,190
it so am I going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier native</font>

978
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,660
application some of the things some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

979
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,700
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> arguably harder to remotely</font>

980
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,830
exploit but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ability to</font>

981
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,299
you know remotely execute scripts then

982
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,160
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it opens up a whole</font>

983
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,390
new wave of issues and you know it

984
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,470
definitely changes a threat model for

985
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:55,480
your application as well at that point

986
00:41:50,470 --> 00:42:02,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I got two minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one more</font>

987
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:02,100
question cool guys thanks
