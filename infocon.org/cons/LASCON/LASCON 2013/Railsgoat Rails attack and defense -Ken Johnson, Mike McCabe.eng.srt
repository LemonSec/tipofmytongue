20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:22,159
don't have souls so why did we decide to

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,119
focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rails and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why do people use</font>

22
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,520
Ruby on Rails so whoever people aren't

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,840
familiar with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's open source so</font>

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,929
it's cheap doesn't cost anything to get

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">started it's it's fast compared to other</font>

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,060
frameworks rails can take half as much

27
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:46,130
time to build out a product compared to

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,240
dog mat or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java and it's dry so Ruby</font>

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,039
there's a concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't repeat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,229
so you don't build a lot of the same

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
code over and over again rails does a

32
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,810
lot of the work for you building

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you need in there so you</font>

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,790
don't not you know doing it all yourself

35
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,520
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gems for code that you</font>

36
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,040
may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write yourself or gems that</font>

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,869
for gems that do things you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,549
do and the codes already written so it

39
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:10,630
makes it easy to kind of just make an

40
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,630
app and get it deployed quickly

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,560
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> realz is spreading their more and</font>

42
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:17,180
more companies starting to use rails at

<font color="#CCCCCC">than just the startups are kind of</font>

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,120
looking at rails to see if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,919

<font color="#CCCCCC">its rise in popularity over the past</font>

59
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,519
know all the developers got hassled all

60
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,500
the time by recruiters because they're

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">just there's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people working on</font>

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,139
rails but not enough people to develop

63
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,629
in it so and I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

64
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">related but this is a graph of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,620
popularity of skinny jeans and jeggings

66
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,209
which sort of correlated to that last

67
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,730
graph but in a correlation isn't

68

causation I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

69
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,090
hipsters determine that for yourself so

70
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,440
there's some demographics we have some

71
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,879
targeted demographics and there's

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,409
problems we're trying to solve with this

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">product and I do refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it as a</font>

product it street<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that treated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,250
such so our first demographic is

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,290
startups startups kind of fall into a

77
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,560
few different categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-funded</font>

78
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">modestly funded and not at all funded so</font>

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,079
in the latter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those categories</font>

80
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">funding may be an issue buying training</font>

81
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,970
may be an issue so trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

82
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:48,768
free<font color="#E5E5E5"> for priorities the priority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

83
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,209
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup is to build new features</font>

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:55,699
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to perform analytics and perform</font>

85
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,760
experiments to see what users like and

00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:03,979
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know make those conversion</font>

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,078
rates go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> securities like that husky</font>

kid in dodgeball that never gets picked

89
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,810
or it gets picked last that's us so

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,329
the the other demographic is the

91
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,280
enterprise and the enterprise they have

92
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,228
the funding but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the</font>

00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,229
resources training policy and software

94
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:25,729

personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking lacking with rails</font>

97
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:37,530
Django node and some Scala a few other

98
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:40,380
frameworks so to rectify this problem we

99
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">created rails</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it's free we like to</font>

100
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,120

it's built for realism it's an HR

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,229
it easily accessible to get back to the

142
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,649
tutorials without actually having to log

143
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:38,438
out so once you hit that button left

144
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:41,989
hand side tutorials are there again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

145
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:44,270
you can hit back to the app and go and

146
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:47,260
actually work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it attacking</font>

147
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,260
so that is that

148
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,710
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna explain this video first</font>

149
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,330
and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask if anybody</font>

150
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,460
needs any clarification on what we're

151
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,008
about to do cuz I want to make sure it's

152
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,258
very clear in what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening so this</font>

153
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">is sort of a teaser video of rails goat</font>

154
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:06,759
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate that you can take</font>

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,530
pre-existing well<font color="#CCCCCC"> X place we've built in</font>

156
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,330
you can chain them together and you can

157
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,419
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> some can sort of have fun with it do</font>

158
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own thing so we we chained together</font>

159
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:19,448
a vulnerability where you can access any

160
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,449
file on the file system in this case we

161
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,830
pulled the secret token file from the

162
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,539
rails application this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard</font>

163
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,820
file that's within most rails

164
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,250
applications some people have abstracted

165
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,280
this out into an environment variable so

166
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,160
that they can pull it in at runtime for

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,359
security reasons but often more often

168
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,860
than not it's hard coded within the

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,800
application so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull that</font>

170
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,639
secret token or going to review<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

171
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,289
current cookie as the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ken we're</font>

172
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,960
going to notice that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user ID</font>

173
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,880
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five associated with that user within</font>

174
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,719
the cookie and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

175
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,729
that secret token<font color="#CCCCCC"> Borge a new cookie</font>

176
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,099
where the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that changes really</font>

177
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,949
is the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs which 21 which is for</font>

178
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,900
the admin and we're going to refresh and

179
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,729
will be logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

180
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,138
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so are there any questions on</font>

181
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:13,740
exactly what is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

182
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:13,740
was long at once<font color="#E5E5E5"> no okay</font>

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,840
so first we<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in this kitten and</font>

184
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,490
validate that we are logged in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ken</font>

185
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,039
and we go to the benefit forms we're

186
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,630
going to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> the benefit form we're</font>

187
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to intercept that request with our</font>

188
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:40,309
intercepting proxy of choice or it's

189
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome and change that to the location</font>

190
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:47,199
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the secret token file in the response</font>

191
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:54,700
you'll see that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a secret token</font>

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">returned so now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to use this to</font>

193
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,730
forge a new session so first things

194
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,740
first we're gonna go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rails</font>

195
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,230
console we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start writing</font>

196
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">some code that created a verifier</font>

197
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,980
instance which allows us to generate

198
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,370
that cookie so we're gonna take our

199
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:18,740
pre-existing cookie logged in as Ken

200
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:21,530
copy that and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to marshal it</font>

201
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:24,230
base64 decode it and then take a look

202
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:29,480
you'll notice with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrow pointing to</font>

203
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:30,980
it is the or not there we go user ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,420
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that to user</font>

205
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:39,230
ID 1 and then we're going to generate

206
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,760
that cookie with the user ID of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 so the</font>

207
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">next step is to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our pre-existing</font>

208
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:48,520
cookie and Firefox edit it delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

209
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,520
replace it with the new cookie we forged

210
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,880
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hit refresh and it will</font>

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,080
be taking take a look at the left<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

212
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,480
side you'll see there's benefit forms

213
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,180
and then once we refresh there's an

214
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,870
admin piece of functionality<font color="#E5E5E5"> there or</font>

215
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,120
link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the admin console so that is</font>

216
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that attack again we've chained together</font>

217
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,520
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different phone abilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

218
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:17,390
application and use they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

219
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:21,569
got a cool way I thought so

220
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:26,069
any questions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

221
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,650
I'll hand it over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Mike so rails</font>

222
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,060
goat has a lot of has the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 built</font>

223
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,180
into it but of course we wanted to

224
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,800
highlight kind of Ruby and rails issues

225
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">also they have kind of some unique</font>

226
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">security issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mass assignments one</font>

227
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,890
you've probably heard about it's what

228
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,050
wets the github hack<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

229
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">where someone was able to add their ass</font>

230
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:48,750
HD to the rails project and then change

231
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,980
anything on the rails project massive

232
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,050
time it's a pretty big issue in rails

233
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,390
projects we see it a lot during our

234
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,939
tests but there's also other issues like

235
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,460
constant eyes which is a it's a ruby

236
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,740
function but it can lead to things like

237
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,360
remote code execution so we kind of

238
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,160
built in some of these features<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

239
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,210
rails go to show how those kind of

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:14,699
issues pop up and show how you can safer

241
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,950
develop these things safer so this video

242
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:22,680
shows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to exploit mass assignment in</font>

243
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:25,080
rails<font color="#CCCCCC"> goat so basically what we're doing</font>

244
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,780
is using an intercepting proxy burp

245
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,000
we're updating our profile / adding

246
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,579
another parameter that is admin equals

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,880
true setting that across<font color="#E5E5E5"> we update our</font>

248
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:39,390
profile we refresh the page and just

249
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,310
like that we're an admin so mass

250
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,160
assignments really easy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

251
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,359
powerful vulnerability really easy to

252
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,310
exploit vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> but really</font>

253
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,760
powerful and it's very prevalent in

254
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:53,819
rails apps and we kind of show how you

255
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">can how you can exploit that in real</font>

256
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,410
scope we do show the real specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> mana</font>

257
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">space and a fist stations of this but</font>

258
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,500
you know we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be we should point</font>

259
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,220
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that obviously mass assignment is</font>

260
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,170
not purely a rails thing and it takes

261
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,240
different names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other frameworks but</font>

262
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:14,500
you know I think some of the libraries

263
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">of node Java spring frameworks like that</font>

264
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,740
so

265
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,199
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> realz good is also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> integrated with</font>

266
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,750
brakeman bundler audit and gauntlet

267
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,240
brakeman is the de facto<font color="#E5E5E5"> static analysis</font>

268
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">tool for rails projects it's developed</font>

269
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:35,300
by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple guys at Twitter open source</font>

270
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,709
free it's a really great tool and if

271
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,810
you're using rails you definitely wanna

272
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,699
be using brakeman blonde or<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit is a</font>

273
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,680
dependency checker so we're one do your

274
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,649
gem list to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's any added</font>

275
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,520
date or vulnerable gems you're running

276
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:51,709
and then gauntlet is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rugged ization</font>

277
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,569
framework so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a way to</font>

278
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:57,649
automate security tests to beat up on

279
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,770
your code so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can automate nmap or</font>

280
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:03,410
the various web web<font color="#CCCCCC"> standards you can</font>

281
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,760
even automate burp with it so we've

282
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,910
integrated those three tools so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

283
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,020
kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security side of how to</font>

284
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,020
secure rails applications

285
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,819
so this next video is going to show

286
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,939
something that I'm pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> passionate</font>

287
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,500
about with this project which is I want

288
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">reals good to be kind of the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

289
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,259
developers learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure rails</font>

290
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,449
applications so secure code training is

291
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:36,579
great but I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of developers</font>

292
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:39,008
get sick of sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a four hour class</font>

293
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,959
looking at PowerPoint slides of rails

294
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,310
issues and so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

295
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,199
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for developers to kind of</font>

296
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:48,969
get their hands dirty and see how these

297
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:51,279
issues pop up and fix them so what's

298
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,889
built into rails goat is a whole suite

299
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,579
of tests using our spec and capybara

300
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:59,949
which is a HTTP library that basically

301
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:02,439
exploits all of the all of the

302
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:04,109
vulnerabilities and the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

303
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,130
developer to go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix those</font>

304
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,790
vulnerabilities and then rerun the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font>

305
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:12,459
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them all passing so this is</font>

306
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,380
running Rick training this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,268
run all the vulnerability tests and you

308
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see right now they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all failing so</font>

309
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:19,899
that means cross-site scripting is their

310
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,110
command injection<font color="#CCCCCC"> is their mass</font>

311
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:26,079
assignment all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there and</font>

312
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:29,199
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list of the</font>

313
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,939
specs that ran they all failed so what

314
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,250
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a developer here is go in and</font>

315
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,050
you find these issues you go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

316
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,550
cross-site scripting for instance he'd

317
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,389
fix the issue then rerun these tests and

318
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,579
that's how you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work through</font>

319
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:44,350
figure out how to fix these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues it's</font>

320
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:48,180
pretty similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test-driven</font>

321
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:50,290
development works so here editing the

322
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,609
view file or moving a method that

323
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,610
creates the cross-site scripting

324
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,889
HTML safe is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the dumbest named</font>

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,820
function in rails then I'm rerunning the

326
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:07,829
tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll see their 14 failures</font>

327
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,600
and one pending pending in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

328
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,790
pretty much means past it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

329
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,589
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set up but that's what a</font>

330
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,719
developer would do to kind of learn how

331
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,790
to fix these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and it kind of its</font>

332
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's more it speaks to how developers</font>

333
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,490
work more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a class of four hours of</font>

334
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,719
secure code training would<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you're</font>

335
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,699
basically doing it in language

336
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,230
developers speaking in the format<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

337
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,550
they're most comfortable with so which

338
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important part yeah another</font>

339
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,639
interesting thing is you can then use

340
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,250
what you learnt here to actually write

341
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,870
tests to test for security issues so

342
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">livingsocial we had a whole library set</font>

343
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,990
up just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the test for security issues</font>

344
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,649
constantly so we would know as soon as

345
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,649
something popped up

346
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,130
so to get started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's pretty</font>

347
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,450
easy it's a rails<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 app sequel I'd</font>

348
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,770
database uses jQuery on the front end

349
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:00,090
it's easy to get set up if you've ever

350
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:02,790
run a rails app before or even if you

351
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,090
haven't I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you haven't so</font>

352
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,490
in terms of contributing to the project

353
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's up on github you can find more</font>

354
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">details at rails go TK tricky com submit</font>

355
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,780
issues pull requests if you want to add

356
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,480
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it even if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

357
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,949
familiar with rails or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ruby definitely</font>

358
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw an issue in there for</font>

359
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,350
something you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see and we'll</font>

360
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,770
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked it in there yeah we do add</font>

contributors to the unofficial<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

362
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,960
official webpage for this project so

363
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,580
enough code gets written to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get thrown</font>

364
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,260
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so the projects so pretty young</font>

365
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,610
but it's kind of picking up speed these

366
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,250
days we've added quite a few

367
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,540
contributors lately and we're just

368
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add more all the time so we</font>

369
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">can make this a better product so this</font>

370
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,630
guy tells you to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and join the</font>

371
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,380
party<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know who he is but in</font>

372
00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,570
terms of in terms of support we develop

373
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,700
on OSX so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best supported</font>

374
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,579
platform when X is generally supported

375
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,290
also it does break occasionally sorry

376
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:11,220
about that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some help in</font>

377
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,170
regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support on Linux it's part of</font>

378
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP broken web applications so you</font>

379
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,170
can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> download that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VM and get it</font>

380
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,910
that way we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to set it up with</font>

381
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,140
vagrants so it's a lot easier to get the

382
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,910
whole environment running very quickly

383
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,350
in terms of windows here rails is a huge

384
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,300
pain door on window so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

385
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,699
focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now we have no</font>

386
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">love for windows whatsoever sorry so so</font>

387
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,440
if you're on Windows and you want to run

388
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:41,620
this just run it in a vm so on the road

389
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,890
maps add two rails goat we want to add

390
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,510
the OWASP top 10 from 2013 there's a

391
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,270
couple changes there that we need to

392
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,760
make that's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> our next big change</font>

393
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,170
trails goat more unit testing showing

394
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,540
more examples with the vulnerabilities

395
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:58,480
we have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of each but we want</font>

396
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add more unit test to show how</font>

397
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
different things pop up the different

398
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,030
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of process scripting how command</font>

399
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,870
injection could pop in in different

400
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:10,389
areas and more the Ruby and rails

401
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,729
specific vulnerabilities another big

402
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,200
issue with rails projects is gems so

403
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,090
you're not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on the</font>

404
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,830
application that someone wrote you're

405
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,990
also depending on all the gems that

406
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using and those quite often have</font>

407
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,620
vulnerabilities in them so you have to

408
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,540
dig into the code base of the

409
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,510
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the code base of all the</font>

410
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,610
gems which can be 100 plus gems in some

411
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:33,040
large projects so the code base can be

412
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,559
huge we can't we kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

413
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,389
vulnerable gems to show how that happens

414
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:39,639
and how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to dig even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> further</font>

415
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,980
into the abstract okotie yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in</font>

416
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,530
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience with and most recently</font>

417
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,360
your experience with devise if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

418
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,610
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you anything that it's</font>

419
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,330
incredibly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss configure some</font>

420
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,100
of these even<font color="#E5E5E5"> security center gems so</font>

cryptography issues people tackle crypto

428
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,879
and rails pretty often and don't do the

429
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:18,710
best job so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of show</font>

430
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:22,310
examples of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong also</font>

431
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:24,140
rails has three major versions this is a

434
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,850
in terms of the rails world but there's

435
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,930
still a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of legacy code</font>

436
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:38,000

nuanced security issues that weren't

439
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,620
part of rails 3 so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

show how those issues pop up in those

442
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,140
different versions we're also going to

443
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,780
add some moderate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced tutorials</font>

444
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,920
so if the more advanced rails programmer

445
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,600
already knows what cross-site scripting

446
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,930
is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add something that's a</font>

447
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,550
little more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them more</font>

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,360
the top ten we talked about massive

00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,790
Simon constant eyes there's some other

451
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,979
interesting ones like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sim</font>

452
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,510
more meta programming issues if anyone's

453
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,130
not from the least amount of programming

454
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,650
its code that writes code it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,980
can monkey patch rails and add in

458
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,110
functionality that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> horrible it's a</font>

459
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,630
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing but it's also a bad thing</font>

460
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,479
and it pops up quite often in rails

461
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:36,050
projects because people hack rails to do

462
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,290
what they need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their in their</font>

463
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,760
example but it ends up adding a lot of

464
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,379
vulnerabilities and we want to add

465
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,800
functionality so we can add more

466
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:51,900
vulnerabilities so so it's a pretty

467
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">short presentation and we purposely did</font>

that only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the fact that every time</font>

469
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,010
we've done this presentation at OS

470
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,860
chapters and whatnot folks usually have

471
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:05,879
some questions sometimes they're

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,949
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> devise an omni off which to be</font>

473
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,580
clear we are adding those into this

474

product but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's sometimes the</font>

476
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,860
their cursor airy but they're always

477
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,450
different so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to open it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

478
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,100
everyone to just ask questions we'll

479
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:26,210
throw up code if need be on the fly and

480
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,209
yeah curious if anyone has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

481
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,900
sorry what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

482
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:39,350
burp suite so yes the web proxy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

483
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,930
were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah burp suite by port sugar</font>

484
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:45,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful so it's as</font>

485
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:48,460
security people were really well there's

486
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,959
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few different proxies out there but</font>

487
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,670
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a security so honestly I</font>

488
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,380
use it developing because it makes my

489
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,260
life a lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> than doing like curl</font>

490
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">commands or messing with you know chrome</font>

491
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,360
and safari you get all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our tools and</font>

492
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,770
whatnot so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty useful yeah</font>

493
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,560
there's a free version of burp that's

494
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,600
pretty good the pro version like two

495
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,550
hundred dollars and adds a decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

496
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,929
functionality I just say I'm surprised

497
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,879
there's no questions on the session

498
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:20,020
forging but maybe you guys really know

499
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so in and out any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions</font>

500
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:29,379
really any rails developers in this room

501
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then</font>

502
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:38,000
the question was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the future</font>

503
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,350
plans for rails ago so we talked a

504
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,570
little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff I</font>

505
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:44,929
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we covered sort of the things</font>

506
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,280
we're doing right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there has been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

507
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">question of do we want to create</font>

508
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,490
multiple branches for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

509
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,469
functionality we want to add in for

510
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,430
instance we've created authentication

511
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">from scratch within this application and</font>

512
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,720
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font>

513
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,450
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to show like hey you probably</font>

514
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,860
shouldn't use md5 hashing however for

515
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks that have questions regarding</font>

516
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,810
devise it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to</font>

517
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,500
build build in both device and

518
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,790
authentication from scratch obviously so

519
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,390
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of whether we created</font>

520
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:20,060
if a branch or there was templates you

521
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:22,610
can use rails generators kind of like to

522
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:25,159
you know add various gems and then it

523
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">just builds out the kind of the it's a</font>

524
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,700
multiple engine or generator<font color="#E5E5E5"> that built</font>

525
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,050
out the application for you so we're

526
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about tinkering with that so</font>

527
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,560
you can choose from five different

528
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,120
options you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can choose to use the</font>

529
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,030
homegrown authentication or you could

530
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">use devise there's also some interesting</font>

531
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,080
gems out there that add kind of admin

532
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,960
functionalities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> flog on top of your</font>

533
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,439
rails app like rails admin which adds a

534
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,700
whole admin interface to your app which

535
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,350
can lead to some serious issues because

536
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,680
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

537
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,270
database so we're going to try to slowly

538
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,370
add those things it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

539
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything because there's thousands of</font>

540
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,419
gems so it's kind of picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

541
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,210
choosing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> best represent what's out</font>

542
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,320
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to keep it realistic so</font>

543
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,360
whether we do it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different branch</font>

544
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,610
or different branches and whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

545
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,469
it in varying templates still to be

546
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,810
decided there's also configuration

547
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,620
settings that folks still don't know

548
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:22,070
about and for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in rails 32 there</font>

549
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,719
is a JSON and<font color="#E5E5E5"> coding setting within the</font>

550
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,540
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary application</font>

551
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,530
configuration setting and actually I

552
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,510
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people don't realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

553
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,540
doesn't actually currently HTML like

554
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,370
rails in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 2 completely ignores that</font>

555
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,320
configuration settings so when people

556
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,018
call something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dot to JSON method</font>

557
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,389
on content it's not actually being

558
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,120
properly HTML encoded upon output which

559
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:49,830
results in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> day query you can</font>

560
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:51,508
executing that and yeah xss so these

561
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">things need to be covered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

562
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the last thing was sort of big</font>

563
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,129
thing with CSP you want to talk a little

564
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,110
bit about CSP and what Neil's doing yeah

565
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">neo at Twitter I'm gonna butcher his</font>

566
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,049
last name my taught at all I don't have

567
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,620
to say it r n DM on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter he's a big</font>

568
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:13,200
fan of CSP content security policy it's

569
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,110
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting spec but it's also</font>

570
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,909
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difficult to implement it can</font>

571
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,668
actually it's a header but it can turn

572
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:22,409
into like 30 lines long if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you</font>

573
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,840
add a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whitelist and blacklist and</font>

574
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:26,220
all these kind of things so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

575
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,769
add some more of that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

576
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,179
the various security headers CSP would

577
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,309
be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting one and kind of show</font>

578
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,080
how a security header can actually end

579
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,799
up biting you if you configure it

580
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,480
incorrectly so there's a lot I mean we

581
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,620
really had the issue of too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices</font>

582
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,299
there's so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things we</font>

583
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,908
could do with this project we want to

584
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep it realistic and keep it to kind of</font>

585
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:49,110
what's popular in the rails world so we

586
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:51,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to be careful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do at and</font>

587
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,820
make it just a huge garbage pile of

588
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,549
various functionality that doesn't work

589
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,110
at all yeah it's fun for us but and it's

590
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:59,100
fun folks to get to use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

591
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it useful to</font>

592
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,840
developers since you know that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

593
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:06,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">our key demographic here is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

594
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,220
those folks out security folks you know

595
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,929
some of the stuff may help you when you

596
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,450
perform static analysis I'm sure it will

597
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:14,850
but I think we're really focused on

598
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,889
making rails applications more secure

599
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:19,769
and we spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decent chunk of our</font>

600
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:22,520
career over the last couple years doing

601
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:24,740
that and we still do it so

602
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,750
yeah it's a passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say at this</font>

603
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:31,190
point yeah and like I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

604
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">specs we want to add more of that and</font>

605
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,090
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to use tool for</font>

606
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,370
developers to learn how to secure their

607
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,169
applications living socials actually

608
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,929
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as their training tool so they</font>

609
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:44,210
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their in scope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI developers</font>

610
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,040
actually run do this tool and fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

611
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,560
that's their evidence for training so

612
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,210
it's actually being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in various</font>

613
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,010
places for training and that's what we

614
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,660
want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing it and get it in</font>

615
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,970
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of developers and kind of you know</font>

616
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,320
tweak it so it works well for them to

617
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,470
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these issues and how to fix</font>

618
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,470
them

619
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,610
decently well I mean since we worked at

620
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,889
livingsocial we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a few the</font>

621
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,919
developers over there of course so we've

622
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">been kind of pushing with them it's</font>

623
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,750
still kind of a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> project and so we're</font>

624
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,010
not trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it pretty solid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

625
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,220
we're kind of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> spreading it</font>

626
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:29,290
everywhere but we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

627
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,110
presentations that you know Ruby and

628
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:35,920
rails groups in the DC area presentation

629
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:38,080
here of course so I mean it's tricky in

630
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rails world security is important</font>

631
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,820
but it's not always thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

632
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:44,260
important that in that world so rails

633
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,689
developers like to build stuff not go

634
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,290
back and you know maintain and always

635
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,480
fix the security issues so it's it's

636
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,040
kind of a tough nut to crack but we're

637
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">just getting in front of people and</font>

638
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,659
showing how easy it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and that</font>

639
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:01,240
kind of gets them gets them bought into

640
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,010
the project yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got early</font>

641
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,260
adopters that's kind of what we're going

642
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,000
for right an early adopter model tell us

643
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,370
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hate tell us what you like we</font>

644
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,130
figure it out implement it or folks help

645
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,540
us and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the feedback</font>

646
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,250
from the rails folks we've brought this

647
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,080
to so far it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually been</font>

648
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:23,020
surprisingly and I say surprisingly

649
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:25,720
because security bringing our take on

650
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,930
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> development groups it's not in</font>

651
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,440
my in my experience always been no

652
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily like oh thank you more so</font>

653
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,820
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I guess I've got to</font>

654
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:38,560
do that but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprisingly it's</font>

655
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,689
we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great response people have</font>

656
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,700
been thanking us so from the rails

657
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,550
community at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least the small chunk that</font>

658
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,370
we're hitting with early adopters so

659
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:51,879
it's been

660
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,870
so yeah I think as more you know there

661
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,090
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of startups out there using</font>

662
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,159
rails but as larger companies use it and

663
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,709
they you know they already have policies

664
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">for frameworks they're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

665
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,230
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think there's going to be</font>

666
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,730
more adoption there because you know

667
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,830
those companies kind of have a

668
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirement to do security and training</font>

669
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,470
versus startups don't always have that

670
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,470
requirement so

671
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,580
I think that's is earning are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

672
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,580
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

673
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,010
yeah the question is as a sinatra

674
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,879
developer which is another Ruby

675
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:36,760
framework it's a rack based framework

676
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,450
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the same issues pop</font>

677
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,240
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sinatra as they do in rails all</font>

678
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,730
the Ruby issues so like constant eyes to

679
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,980
sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Dallas Warner ability mass</font>

681
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:53,170
Sinatra which I've I've seen quite a bit

682
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,120
see a lot of that stuff and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

683
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 still happens in Sinatra</font>

686
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,000
scripting Stefan going to be an issue

687
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,290
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't I'll God for course</font>

688
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,760
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use mainly for api's I</font>

689
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:12,490
mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weasel diesel generator</font>

690
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,560
for it weasel diesel generator for it by

691
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,840
Matt Damon Eddie a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

692
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,700
some issues just in how it handled

693
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,050
unexpected parameters that were entered

694
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,730
it was just echoing those parameters

695
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,530
right back just like little<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

696
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have improved over time but there's</font>

697
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,460
still these you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for</font>

698
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,219
application generators essentially out

699
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,600
there that kind of live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between you</font>

700
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,610
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their middleware so they live in</font>

701
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,620
between you know they handle the

702
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,629
requests and act accordingly with them

703
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,610
so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> have issues that gems like you</font>

704
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,160
said some of the same gems are used not

705
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily like well actually I mean if</font>

706
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,200
you if you can if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a Sinatra</font>

707
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,790
app that's talking to a database some

708
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,039
folks choose to use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> corrector in there</font>

709
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,720
so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things still apply absolutely</font>

710
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:56,629
