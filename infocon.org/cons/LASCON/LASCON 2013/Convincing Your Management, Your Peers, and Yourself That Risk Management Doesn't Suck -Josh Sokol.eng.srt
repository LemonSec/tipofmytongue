1
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,220
normally I like to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off my talks</font>

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,810
with something some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a joke</font>

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,250
something funny but I think the talc

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,049
does that for me so my lucky said I'm

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
Josh<font color="#CCCCCC"> sokol I'm the information security</font>

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,040
program owner over in National

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,129
Instruments my motivations for this talk

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,989
so first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in several risk</font>

9
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,449
management talks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past and most of</font>

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,500
them were pretty boring and that's

11
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:44,730
probably saying the best thing about

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have come to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me in</font>

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,510
the past and move back here so my mic

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,970
doesn't echo a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have come</font>

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in the past and they've you know</font>

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,140
said I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking in my management</font>

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,879
they just won't listen to me they they

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,010
don't listen to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to say and</font>

19
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,989
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to put together a</font>

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,210
talk that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked about how do</font>

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,298
you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to management how do you use</font>

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,570
security tools actually convince them to

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,180
do things like security projects I've

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,889
had people<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say well you</font>

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find all my vulnerabilities by</font>

26
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,869
scanning the environment and by using

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,369
expose or whatever and they saved my

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,200
peers they won't talk to me they won't

29
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,649
tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems so I have to go and</font>

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,229
try and find them proper risk management

31
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,219
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> using risk and risk is</font>

32
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,350
something we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a lot</font>

33
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,329
about today and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk to drive</font>

34
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,130
organizational improvement we're taking

35
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,020
these risks and we're using them to feed

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,899
back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and actually gain</font>

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,649
them to prioritize problem based on

38
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:45,149
those ribs this may just be me but I

39
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,179
feel like risk management can actually

40
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,409
be interesting extremely valuable so

41
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:51,389
let's start and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talk about</font>

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal risk management because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

43
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,960
this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> draws with risk management</font>

44
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,969
back to something that we're all very

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,249
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in personal risk</font>

46
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,538
management you're doing this all right

47
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,449
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in your everyday life</font>

48
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:05,670
so take my house right I have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex</font>

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,990
house I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice things in my house and</font>

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,030
I don't want those things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stolen</font>

51
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,459
or I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want those things to get</font>

52
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,380
destroyed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire so I've made a</font>

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,000
personal risk assessment I've looked at

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,769
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I've looked at my property</font>

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,230
and said what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

56
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:22,230
I'm worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what are the risks to</font>

57
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:26,069
meet and then based on those risks I

58
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,119
plan mitigations so i may say well for

59
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,119
the most part live in a decent

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,640
neighborhood nobody's can break in I do

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,950
any bars on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my windows that's a decision</font>

62
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,170
that I made and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> accepted that but I</font>

63
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,700
do feel like there's some chance that

64
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody might want to steal my kids</font>

65
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,950
Christmas presents or my nice TV right

66
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,080
so in order to prevent that I've planned

67
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,760
mitigations I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> put things like an</font>

68
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">alarm system on there if you break a</font>

69
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,989
window<font color="#E5E5E5"> and alarm goes off if you open my</font>

70
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,849
front door and alarm goes off and those

71
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">are personal risk management decisions</font>

72
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:58,129
that I've made in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate</font>

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,319
those risks now air products risk

74
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:02,540
management really isn't any different

75
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,390
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those risks but on an</font>

76
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,548
enterprise level so real quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> show of</font>

77
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,149
hands who here has an existing risk

78
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:12,470
management program come<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

79
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in starting the risk</font>

80
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,120
management program couple more so for

81
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,730
those who didn't raise your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

82
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,040
are you here you know what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

83
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,709
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's risk management we're</font>

84
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure out for for you guys</font>

85
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,739
how do we make risk management work so

86
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:32,780
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> management is about threats and</font>

87
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:35,720
consequences so when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

88
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,090
chart here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at different types of</font>

89
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,310
risk and risk can be all over the board

90
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,709
we financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be</font>

91
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,810
reputational damage risk around

92
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,209
reputation damage and each of these

93
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,889
risks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different consequences at</font>

94
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:51,230
different levels depending on what

95
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:53,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens so take the financial loss for</font>

96
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,668
example our low consequence there is

97
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,980
that some sort of unit manager could

98
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">contain the anticipated loss in our</font>

99
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,448
operational budget that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty low</font>

100
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,730
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> low impact there but if we look</font>

101
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the high consequence it says recovery</font>

102
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,358
from the anticipated loss will be

103
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:11,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">handled by the CEO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and board as a</font>

104
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,859
special item<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty big one board</font>

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,230
has to get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something going</font>

106
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,090
on in your company other types of

107
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,339
threats and consequences regulatory

108
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,969
non-compliance what happens if I'm not

109
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">PCI compliance or softs compliant</font>

110
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,810
business interruptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> downtown things</font>

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,449
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even safety hazards if</font>

112
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,039
somebody slips and falls on a puddle<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

113
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,099
the floor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens because our roof</font>

114
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,780
is leaking that's a risk and the risk is

115
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,800
if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> slips and falls we could get</font>

116
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,349
sued that's

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,729
person could get hurt right so we need

118
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,469
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all these different risk</font>

119
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:44,240
types and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what's</font>

120
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the consequences not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only do we have to</font>

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,479
figure out what the consequences are but

122
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:51,259
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out what do we want to</font>

123
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with that in an ideal world you know</font>

124
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:57,680
in an ideal scenario risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> management is</font>

125
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,780
a prioritization process we look at the

126
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,849
wrist with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest loss or impact</font>

127
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,888
and the greatest probability or

128
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,830
likelihood of occurring and we like to

129
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,639
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that have the highest</font>

130
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,590
volt first and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list so lower</font>

131
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,330
probability of occurrence lower loss

132
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,340
they all get handled in just in

133
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,289
descending order so on this chart up

134
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,560
here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that we have wrist</font>

135
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:23,360
number one has an extreme impact in an

136
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,889
almost certain likelihood that's

137
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's probably going to</font>

138
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,259
happen and when it happens it can be

139
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,909
really really bad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

140
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:33,680
from a risk perspective is that's

141
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,810
probably the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want to</font>

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,669
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> component</font>

143
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,009
that goes into here which is level of

144
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,109
effort right you know if it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

145
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:45,139
of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money to fix that risk</font>

146
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,750
and our potential damage is less than

147
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:50,029
the cost to fix it well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

148
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't handle that but in general this</font>

149
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> andale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are risks from the</font>

150
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,409

151
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,430

152
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,719
risk management missed 830 is the

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,099
framework from the federal government

there's all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different stuff but</font>

157
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here is that these are</font>

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,900
somebody else's vision of what risk

159
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,789
management should be this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,449

they need to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the rest of us</font>

167
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,469
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do risk management</font>

168
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,659
that's best for our company so at best

169
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:40,279
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be a guideline they give</font>

170
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:43,159
you examples of what other people are

171
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,440
doing at worse they make risk management

172
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,509
look overly complicated make it really

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult to get started when I first</font>

178
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,130
calculate this and put this it's

179
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,810
ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really risk management is</font>

when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first got started in risk</font>

194
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,090

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> call me RC tools governance risk</font>

196
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,969
and compliance and I started talking to

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the major vendors and I actually</font>

198
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,100
got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> before and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they quoted me half a</font>

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,360
ridiculous half a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million bucks I was</font>

203
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,300
and my may have been laughed at me

204
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,400
they're like half a million bucks your

205
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,170
security program is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to zero</font>

206
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,479
right now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not getting half a</font>

207
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,250
million bucks for a two-year<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat so I</font>

208
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,780
got wise I was like all right well<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

209
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,000
go to all these different<font color="#E5E5E5"> other guys</font>

210
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,099
here and I start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to them and</font>

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,020
maybe I take that half a million dollars

212
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,760
I split up between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 other groups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

213
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,400
national instruments they're all doing

214
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">risk based decisions and now we're</font>

215
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,880
paying fifty thousand bucks apiece well

216
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,530
when we got to the end of the

217
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,030
presentation I said who likes this who

218
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants the school everybody raised their</font>

219
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,630
hands and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's going to be</font>

220
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,360
50,000 mu and fifty thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

221
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:33,630
and they they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wants to pay</font>

222
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,190
for the same no way so risk can apply to

223
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,090
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different stuff I'll</font>

224
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,479
continue that story in a sec<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

225
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:44,970
wrist formula so<font color="#CCCCCC"> risp usually takes in</font>

226
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,830
two different pieces when we're

227
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,840
calculating it the first is likelihood

228
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,940
likely is just the probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

229
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,580
something occurring what is the

230
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,860
likelihood of something happening the

231
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,600
second is impact which is expected

232
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,839
locked if that occurs

233
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:08,880
we can use different<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

234
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,880
be your company or as they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

235
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:19,660
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> going up so it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

236
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,819
different now what we do is we take that

237
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,800
risk formula we take those two pizzas

238
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:25,630
the probability the likelihood of it

239
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,180
happening and the impact if it does

240
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,699
happen multiply those two values

241
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,529
together and what we get with that is

242
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:34,529
the wrist so what you see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

243
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:44,680
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do this test s alright so</font>

244
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,930
what you see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom is a chart</font>

245
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,449
and the chart is really just a simple

246
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">calculation it's taking the risk or the</font>

247
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,979
likelihood on one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,050
other side and it's calculating the two

249
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,550
of them together it's taking a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

250
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,199
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> five scale on one one through</font>

251
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,939
five scale on the other multiplying

252
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,729
those two values up and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

253
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,259
this kind of nice little chart and when

254
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,209
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at its that the probability</font>

255
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:12,220
thing the the the ideal scenario that

256
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,768
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're up here on the</font>

257
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,540
top this is our high level rose the

258
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:18,610
orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff here that's our medium risk</font>

259
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,680
the yellow stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that's our low</font>

260
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,199
level risk and then the white stuff is

261
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,300
insignificant and it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font>

262
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,459
significant risk it's okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

263
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,439
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care about this stuff I'm</font>

264
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,359
being documented I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that</font>

265
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:33,910
there's a risk here but if it you know

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,980
the likelihood of it happening and the

267
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,019
impact if it does happen is so low I

268
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,970
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to waste cycles on this</font>

269
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:46,470
that's okay now make your risk formula

270
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:49,420
fit you I pulled it off turn it off when

271
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,779
wireless make your risk formula fit you

272
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:56,589
so what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your formula</font>

273
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,360
can and will change so in this case why

274
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,310
I've done is I've taken that<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk equals</font>

275
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,089
likely at times impact I've actually

276
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,219
added

277
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,920
back to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually weights the</font>

278
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,699
formula so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consider impact to be</font>

279
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,248
more important<font color="#CCCCCC"> than likely hood and so</font>

280
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,839
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see by the chart it skews a</font>

281
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:18,339
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards that impact</font>

282
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:21,040
right now likewise we can make it plus

283
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,749
likelihood and when we do that we skew

284
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,029
it the other way we skew it more towards

285
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:26,319
the likelihood so what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

286
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:28,540
doing when you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

287
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,829
performing risk management is you should

288
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,360
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this you should be</font>

289
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,329
modifying your formula tweaking those

290
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,759
values and and seeing what works best

291
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you what of this what what do you</font>

292
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,649
consider to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be high level risk well you</font>

293
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,969
consider be medium as<font color="#CCCCCC"> low level risk and</font>

294
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,399
seeing if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that formula to</font>

295
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,009
kind of fit you guys now you can also do

296
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,689
double Wade in double a likelihood you

297
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,819
can tweak this formula however you want

298
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,309
the idea here is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font>

299
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:56,498
flexible risk management needs to be a

300
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:59,829
custom fit your organization and your

301
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:01,629
formula needs to reflect that your

302
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,939
formula can and likely will change and

303
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,860
wherever you're tracking risks doesn't

304
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:08,290
matter if it's in GRC to lure in an

305
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,139
excel doc or whatever it should be able

306
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,910
to dynamically update risk based on that

307
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:14,709
new formula so you should basically be

308
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,449
able to plug and play a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> formula and</font>

309
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,160
have it automatically update all that

310
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,679
stuff if it can't do that you got

311
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,529
problems right what this usually means

312
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:25,329
is word sucks right because word doesn't

313
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:27,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">do all those dynamically updating</font>

314
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,790
without you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> special you know</font>

315
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,949
hotkeys and things like that no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel</font>

316
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,509
documents it can do some formula stuff

317
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:36,309
but when you're trying to calculate

318
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,990
risks on the fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have it update</font>

319
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:40,629
other stuff it gets really complicated

320
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,600
very quickly I think Victorian can tell

321
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that other stack form formats</font>

322
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,050
text files and things like that become

323
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:50,410
really cumbersome when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

324
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,709
do risk management now let's talk about

325
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,929
convincing your management this is one

326
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:58,268
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardest things to do as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

327
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:59,769
practitioner and the reason being<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as</font>

328
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:02,470
security practitioners when we're

329
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,269
talking about risk well a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

330
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,980
don't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about risk and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of</font>

331
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,769
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem but when you're</font>

332
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to management you need to</font>

333
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:14,329
communicate in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that management</font>

334
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,430
understands you need to speak

335
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,839
management speaks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ritz businesses make</font>

336
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,790
decisions on what they're going to

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,829
invest in what tools they're going to

338
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,660
purchase<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we're going to acquire</font>

339
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:27,269
that company over there those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

340
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk based decisions so as security</font>

341
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,230
practitioners we need to make sure that

342
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are speaking the same language that</font>

343
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,209
management is speaking interim this

344
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,579
means we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not talking CVEs we're not</font>

345
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:42,750
talking attack vectors we're not talking

346
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:43,949
threat trees we are speaking risk your

347
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility as a security</font>

348
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">professional I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is another</font>

349
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,839
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we fall down your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">responsibility as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

351

352
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,670
ribs it is not to accept ribs and this

353
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,790
is where we all get very tied up around

354
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,709
the axle we feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey this there's a</font>

355
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem here we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fix this we have</font>

356
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix it if we don't fix this I'm going</font>

357
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose my job right it's not like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

358
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,529
as security professionals we need to

359
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,480
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that our job is to figure out</font>

360
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the problems are out there and then</font>

361
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,100
make sure management knows about that

362
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,720
and that they can say yes I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

363
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,149
this yes I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something about</font>

364
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,699
the ESI acceptance so we need to give

365
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:26,370
management visibility and make them have

366
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:28,439
accountability right so as security

367
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,750
practitioners we are collecting and

368
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,750
conveying we are not accepting the wrist

369
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,459
and that's very very important

370
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,920
management their responsibilities to

371
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,869
evaluate how to respond to that risk so

372
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,509
they make the decision do we accept this

373
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,490
do we buy insurance for it or do we

374
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:46,680
reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rows right through some sort</font>

375
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,779
of mitigation and if you do a good job

376
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,758
of guiding management through the risk

377
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,529
analysis then the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> result is</font>

378
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that they can actually use</font>

379
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,149
it's a list of proud of priorities that

380
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:59,579
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then feed directed back into</font>

381
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,829
projects and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say hey if we do</font>

382
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,079
this disaster recovery project over here

383
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,849
we fix this disaster recovery issue by

384
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> risks that was submitted by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

385
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,810
union team and this one by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

386
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,550
team and this one by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the windows team we</font>

387
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,829
fix a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of risks in our</font>

388
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,290
environment through this one project

389
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,870
right so if we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk management</font>

390
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,910
effectively management actually sees

391
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,130
direct result from that and they're

392
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,400
actually you you are providing value add

393
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,500
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the business now risk management</font>

394
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,410
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> fail if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have the support</font>

395
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peers the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being is that</font>

396
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,000
management can only be proactive in

397
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,120
addressing risk if they know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,270
risks exists so somehow you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

399
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,430
out what those risks are this means that

400
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get your peers bought in on</font>

401
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,239
the fact that risk management of

402
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,640
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of value to them and</font>

403
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,950
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you tell</font>

404
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,810
them if the risk is undocumented if you

405
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,180
carry this inside you if that's the

406
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,280
skeleton in your closet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that</font>

407
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">you shoulder the responsibility of this</font>

408
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,569
risk if it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

409
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,060
anybody about it you're the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who gets</font>

410
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">in trouble but if this risk is</font>

411
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,849
documented if it's something we put into

412
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,770
our system I will personally help you so

413
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> management will see that risk they</font>

414
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,390
will know that's there not only that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

415
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,640
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> will accept that risk well</font>

416
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,460
this means is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledge the</font>

417
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,350
risk exists and any action or inaction

418
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,520
if they say well you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

419
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,430
going to do anything we on the money

420
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,110
whatever it's now on their shoulders so

421
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,540
security practitioners sleep better at

422
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,830
night management sleeps by right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

423
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,329
because they know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

424
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they didn't know about before and</font>

425
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:43,200
your pure sleep better at night risk

426
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,940
management helps everybody now

427
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,140
determining risk there's lots of

428
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways that we can determine</font>

429
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,930
risk and the first thing is why I just

430
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">said if you can convince your peers that</font>

431
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:58,989
documenting risk is something of value

432
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,550
to them if it's CYO a for them then you

433
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,610
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more risks than you know what</font>

434
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,440
to do it right you start telling them

435
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,490
hey if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me some redness if you</font>

436
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,530
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about the problems in your</font>

437
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment I'll help you make them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

438
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,859
away and I will make sure the management

439
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,690
sees these things they're like okay

440
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,699
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you know you're here</font>

441
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,300
take them all right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want I don't</font>

442
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,709
want where that burden on my shoulders

443
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,839
now there's other ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

444
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:25,000
and if unfortunately you can't convince

445
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:26,859
your peers some of these others are what

446
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,569
you're going to end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing now we're</font>

turns you'll learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the newest</font>

453
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,669
you know Oh days and things like that

454
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,139
before anybody else does in any case we

455
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,620
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine what the</font>

456
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,270
risks are in our environment when you're

457
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,580
evaluating the race so now you know that

458
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the risk is there the first question you</font>

459
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,050
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself is is the risk of</font>

460
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,850
acceptable is the likelihood or impact

461
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,129
low enough that I'm willing to just

462
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,760
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consequences if it happens</font>

463
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,040
and security practitioners don't really

464
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,320
like to hear this option right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we like</font>

465
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to feel like every security problem is</font>

466
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,200
extremely important have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed</font>

467
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,300
but the unfortunate fact is some risk

468
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,220
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not worth handling if it</font>

469
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,810
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> true it might affect that little</font>

470
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,520
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there it might take</font>

471
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,070
down that server over there but in the

472
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,740
big picture it's not going to be that

473
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">bad so security practitioners we need to</font>

474
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,430
do a better job of not going out and

475
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,159
saying the sky is<font color="#E5E5E5"> falling the sky is</font>

476
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">falling we have to understand that</font>

477
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,450
different issues have different levels

478
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,189
of risk and based on those different

479
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,670
levels of risk we need to take different

480
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,320
types of actions so the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

481
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,680
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked when evaluating the risk is</font>

482
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,409
this is the risk transferable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

483
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is can i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase some</font>

484
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:54,880
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of insurance or some other measure</font>

485
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,830
that transfers the impact of the risk to

486
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,410
another party and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give you an</font>

487
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,409
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> so at ni we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> processing</font>

488
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,820
credit cards right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

489
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit cards on your systems you're</font>

490
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,929
subject to pci compliance which means

491
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a whole bunch of pci data</font>

492
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,160
security standards that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

493
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow not only that but if you give</font>

494
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,540
breached and those credit cards go away

495
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,150
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty big liability for the</font>

496
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,610
company right so what we've done is

497
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken in tokenization approach we</font>

498
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,969
take those credit cards they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

499
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch our systems we farm them out</font>

500
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,290
someplace else we've transferred the

501
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,760
risk from National Instruments we still

502
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,889
have the ability of process those credit

503
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,990
cards but we've transferred the risk and

504
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the liability associated with those to</font>

505
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,850
another part now the third question

506
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,890
winning evaluating the risk is is the

507
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,419
risk reducible is there some sort of

508
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,660
mitigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be put in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place to</font>

509
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduce the impact or likely and this is</font>

510
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,710
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

511
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,270
patching and this is where we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to web</font>

512
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,850
application firewalls and things like

513
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,100
that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put a mediation in place to</font>

514
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:01,240
make this risk less likely to happen or

515
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,800
the impact less if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does so here's a</font>

516
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,200
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> chart on determining that</font>

517
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,500
response you have your acceptable your

518
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,050
transferable and your reducible amp the

519
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,300
answer is no to all three the answer the

520
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,070
action here is don't engage in this

521
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,960
avoid the risk if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't accept it</font>

522
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,970
you can transfer it and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce</font>

523
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:25,060
the risk don't do it right if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

524
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,150
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is acceptable it is transferable</font>

525
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,159
is reducible then our action is we can

526
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,840
choose we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can balance the three we can</font>

527
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,660
optimize we can choose the least cost

528
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,830
approach right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> options so</font>

529
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,590
when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out with</font>

530
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,800
each of your wrists what to do with them

531
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">your answers are here now risk</font>

532
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,840
management is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a process for avoiding</font>

533
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk right we want to have risk in our</font>

534
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,639
environment we just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

535
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,140
educated decisions about those risks the

536
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,910
aim of risk management is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font>

537
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,760
eliminate risk but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage the</font>

and we want to maximize the

540
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,730
opportunities and minimize the adverse

541
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,479
effects risk management<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about making</font>

542
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:09,760

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:15,310
management of insurable risk insurance

is transferring worse lots of different

<font color="#CCCCCC">things that risk management should be it</font>

553
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,220
management is a cyclical process and

554
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,650
what this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you start off at the</font>

555
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,690
top here where it says that we identify

556
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">characterize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and assess threats that's</font>

557
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,890
step one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to figure out what's</font>

558
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,158
there step<font color="#E5E5E5"> two we assess the</font>

559
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,979
vulnerability of our assets

560
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,409
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> first so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a windows Oh</font>

561
00:21:55,979 --> 00:22:01,799
day but my entire environment is Linux

562
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:03,749
it doesn't matter right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that oday can</font>

563
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,210
hit my servers all day long and<font color="#CCCCCC"> senaka</font>

564
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:08,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">effect so we assess the vulnerability</font>

565
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,159
the third piece is determining the wrist

566
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:13,258
so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know what's out there and</font>

567
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,359
how it affects us now we can determine

568
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,450
what's the likely of this happening and

569
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,129
what's the impact to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us if it does then</font>

570
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,159
we identify ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce those risks</font>

571
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,959
we plan our maiya<font color="#CCCCCC"> gations and then the</font>

572
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,570
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece years we prioritize this</font>

573
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,580
because each of those mitigations each

574
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,349
of those risks has different levels and

575
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mitigations are going to be</font>

576
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:35,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">different for each one or sometimes we</font>

577
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,929
can love multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together and fix</font>

578
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,399
them with the same thing so we

579
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,590
prioritize our risk reduction measures

580
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,928
based on strategy and we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,668
consideration business constraints what

582
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,409
is the level of app how much money<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">again tape how many resource do that</font>

585
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:53,999
to fix it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once we get done with</font>

586
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:57,418
that we start all over again we look for

587
00:22:53,999 --> 00:23:00,139
new issues plan our medications right so

588
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:03,210
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a one inductor current</font>

589
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:07,168
risk review process may depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on aldine</font>

590
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:10,320
your organizational structure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ni</font>

591
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:12,989
what we've decided you is we decide to

592
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,720
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our levels</font>

593
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:17,729
of management so we have area mattress

594
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,519
we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX team manager or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

team manager network team manager we

596
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,809
have directors who kind of sit across

597
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:26,820
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those teams and then we have a VP</font>

598
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:29,190
who acts basically like the CTO of the

599
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,519
organization and what we've chosen and

600
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:35,970
do is based on the level of those risks

601
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:38,999
we assign the ability to review those

602
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:42,179
risks to those individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for</font>

603

things that are managers can sign off on

605
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,109
there are issues no doubt but there are

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on a manager level we should</font>

be able handle they should be able to

prioritize resources figure out how to

609
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,369
fix that stuff if it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get fixed</font>

610
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,039
it's low enough that it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

611
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:01,529
big deal if it's medium I want my

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,280
my formula right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the high level</font>

617
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,570
risk should be such a small number right

618
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,000
and the medium level where it should be

619
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:19,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small number so that most of my</font>

this right now we also use the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

626
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,300
of strategy when we're reviewing our

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,060
risks we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a cyclical what that</font>

628
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,330
means is for low-level risks we review

629
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,669
them once a year we go through once a

630

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,189
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create strategy create a framework</font>

638
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,460
might be patched tomorrow so we need to

make sure we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through our</font>

management is the same slide we had

642
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,740
before we're all right so how do we

643
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,620
derive value of this first thing we are

644
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,140
if I risk level then we group them if

<font color="#CCCCCC">meg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Asians artisan so if we have</font>

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,500
multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged i dint identity</font>

project addresses all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes and</font>

651

<font color="#E5E5E5">we say this project was approved by</font>

management for consideration our next

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,410
budget cycle how cool is that when

656
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,200
you're being told you would now have the

657
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:52,000
authority to go out and fix this thing

658
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,830
management has said yes we acknowledge

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,080
this as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue yes we think it's</font>

660
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,149
important please go figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out allocate</font>

661
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,860
resources and fixes that's awesome

662
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:04,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way it should be for security</font>

663
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:05,709
practitioners right so tools there's

664
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,560
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools out there and i kind of</font>

665
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,150
started sharing you yo Mike GRC story

666
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,679
right easily a hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

667
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us they were quoting us half a</font>

668
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,270
million bucks there's spreadsheets

669
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,809
there's open<font color="#CCCCCC"> fisma</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody told me</font>

670
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,490
about

671
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,580
it's not really risk management but it

672
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:26,019
could kind of fit the bill anybody heard

673
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:29,799
of a free tools out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in any</font>

674
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:32,889
case after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got turned down not once</font>

675
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,799
but twice from multiple groups on my

676
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:38,918
risk management GRC tool i went back and

677
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:41,379
it turns out we had an old lowest notes

678
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,690
database and the lowest notes database

679
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:45,370
was actually kind of set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take and</font>

680
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,499
wrists and calculate risks and things

681
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,408
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start trying to use this</font>

682
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:52,960
kludgy thing and quickly i found out

683
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:55,389
that wasn't flexible<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had something</font>

684
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 150 200 risks that were in this</font>

685
00:26:55,389 --> 00:27:01,449
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started I I asked well one I</font>

686
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,759
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mom I a myself I had to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

687
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,009
a notes admin idiot and I talked to my

688
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,549
notes at<font color="#CCCCCC"> man I said hey would you please</font>

689
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:11,679
change the formula instead of it being

690
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:13,899
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it was I was like well</font>

691
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">he do likelihood times impact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font>

692
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,799
impact I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait an impact</font>

693
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,019
formula and she was like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do</font>

694
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,899
that she changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the formula but now my</font>

695
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:24,940
numbers change what the heck and what I

696
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,518
figured out is I had to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

697
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,220
individual risk and resave it in order

698
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,919
for it to recalculate the value suppe in

699
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,629
the boat right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that ain't</font>

700
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,730
changes I want to make if I wanted to

701
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:38,590
add a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment field or you know add</font>

702
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,769
this piece of reference ID or whatever

703
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,928
it wasn't there I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's</font>

704
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,340
a problem because when we're trying to

705
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,840
do risk management we need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

706
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,830
flexible we need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

707
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,509
changes on the fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I started looking</font>

708
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,360
at all this stuff couldn't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

709
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:58,299
GRC notes database Sox can't use

710
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,959
spreadsheets and whatnots so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up</font>

711
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:05,590

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience with with PHP and some</font>

713
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,939
experience with my sequel and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

gonna sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start</font>

715
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,080
writing something and so that's exactly

716
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did I wrote something called</font>

717
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,970
simple risk and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started writing this</font>

718
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:23,110
back in March and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I released the first</font>

719
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:25,149
version of it in April at bsides Austin

720
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,619
conference and while i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do is</font>

721
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:29,018
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you guys the simple</font>

722
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:29,709
risk tool that I've written simple risk

723
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:32,440
is free

724
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:35,470
it is open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and is available for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all you guys so what i've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

726
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:41,649
i've already installed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a guide</font>

727
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,408
right there for installing simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

728
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:46,389
on an immunity server<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got this guy up</font>

729
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and write less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 days it might</font>

depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how familiar you are with</font>

732
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:59,110
it but this is comportas I to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

733
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:03,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a username and password default</font>

735
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,720

736
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:09,219
here is your report so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

737
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,200
lot of stuffs minute I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think have one</font>

738
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,559
risk and it's currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed so you</font>

739
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see openers 20 but normally you'd</font>

740
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some nice pretty graphs here you'd</font>

741
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:21,399
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pie charts about the stuff in</font>

742
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,870
your environment now let's go through

743
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,189
let's start with configure because I

744
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,039
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is important because it</font>

745
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,750
illustrates everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set now</font>

746
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,600
if you go in here the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

747
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,520
is risk for me right we can see our risk

748
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,039
formulas likely times impact well it

749
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,929
what I've built in here is for other

750
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,570
formulas that you can use for risk

751
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:42,100
management and again it's PHP so you can

752
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,770
actually modify this you can create your

753
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">own own formulas if you'd like in this</font>

754
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,760
case I've had weighed impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> weighed</font>

755
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,020
like good and double weight and<font color="#CCCCCC"> packing</font>

756
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,460
double way of likelihood those are

757
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,770
probably the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common things that you</font>

758
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,659
would use now you're able to go through

759
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,220
you're able to change the formula you're

760
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:59,169
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change what you consider to be</font>

761
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:03,220
high medium and low level<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

762
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:05,740
based on CBS s form what what their

763
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,289
defaults are you can configure review

764
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,070
settings so like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> low level risks</font>

765
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:15,010
every year medium level risks every 180

766
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,260
days in this case hi every 90 days right

767
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,750
but this is customizable all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

768
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,929
values teams categories technologies

769
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:25,600
they're all configurable user management

770
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:28,620
so you can actually assign users two

771
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,699
different teams you can create<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

772
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,059
responsibilities for users who's able

00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">smit risk we can modify who can review</font>

774
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,820
what levels of rooms you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> change my</font>

775
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,120
naming conventions and it keeps a

<font color="#CCCCCC">full-on auditor</font>

777
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,790
every activity within the system is

778
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,650
locked in the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

779
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,149
risk management tab and this is where

780
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,950
you submit your wrist I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried like</font>

781
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,650
the name says I've tried to make this as

00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,110
simple as possible for you guys step 1

783
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:03,520
submit the race so we go through here

to be adding some other restoring

800
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:50,540
methods in here in the near future CBS s

801

form is slightly different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I've add</font>

some help stuff on the bottom so if you

want to figure out attack vector and

804
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,240
what local or adjacent or network means

805
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,100
it's got some text there to help you

it a risk assessment we can create

821
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,330
planned out so let's put that and now we

822
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,180
can plan it so in this case this is

823
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,500
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to mitigate</font>

824
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:54,400
effort will be considerable we can put a

825
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,260
solution in there and then we submit now

826
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,120
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go back to our mediation view you</font>

can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's nothing there we've</font>

829
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,140
we perform our management reviews and

830
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,150
again based on what you've set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

831
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:10,450
different people can perform this type

view this comes in a medium<font color="#CCCCCC"> lahore's so</font>

833
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">we click on no we get a review we want</font>

834
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,470
to prove this risk our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is to</font>

835
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,150
consider for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project you can put some</font>

836
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,450
comments there if you want when we

837
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:24,910
submit gone now that risk is no longer

838
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,040
required to be reviewed so our next step

839
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:30,400
we want prioritize before project

840
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">planning you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a new risk in</font>

841
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,660
this case let's call it last con dr as a

842
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,240
project and now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new tab in</font>

843
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,590
here for last kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dr because we said</font>

844
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,660
we want to consider this risk for a

845
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,300
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sits here in our unassigned</font>

846
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,060
risk we can drag and drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy into</font>

847
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:52,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last con dr bucket and save that</font>

848
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,889
project out and now every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go in</font>

849
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,920
here we can see our last convey our

850
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,720
product encompasses these risks we can

851
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,690
also prioritize so if i want my last

852
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,530
time dr to be more important or show

853
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,690
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> over my hot side i can do that</font>

854
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,960
now every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go this page that will</font>

855
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:11,270
change now the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is how often we</font>

856
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,010
review these rooms so in this case I

857
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,949
only have one risk which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for kind</font>

858
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,900
of a sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> mo but we can review those</font>

859
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:20,509
ribs so if we go into here it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

860
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">take whatever time frames i hope i've</font>

861
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,020
plugged in there and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

862
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,179
calculate based on that risk level when

863
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,610
my next review<font color="#E5E5E5"> day days so in this case</font>

864
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:32,000
my medium<font color="#E5E5E5"> level risk is every 180 days</font>

865
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:34,390
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had 180 days to today and we get</font>

866
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,630
this next review date for this risk is

867
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:41,540
april 2014 right so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

868
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:44,120
framework where we can go we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> samaras</font>

869
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,250
we can plan our mitigations we can

870
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">perform our management reviews we can</font>

871
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,750
prioritize for our planning and we can

872
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,250
review them on a regular basis we also

873
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the ability to go in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and do</font>

874
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,080
some reporting and we can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

875
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,880
the open risks are assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what</font>

876
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:07,730
are the opener is ordered by risk level

877
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:17,390
actually let's see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can so I have if</font>

878
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:20,450
you go to demo simple risk org I have a

879
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:23,180
demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> side set up user name is user</font>

880
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:28,390
passwords user and just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

881
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,390
see see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty these charts are you</font>

882
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,390
so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like when you</font>

883
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
have a lot of stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got lots of</font>

884
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">people going through here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in swimming</font>

885
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,510
risk we can see the risks that are

886
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:42,099
assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me as the user we can order</font>

887
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">them my risk level pro tip here all of</font>

888
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,280
these columns<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually searchable so</font>

889
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,560
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store them by ID instead</font>

890
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,270
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click it you want to sort my</font>

891
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,799
subject you just click it you want to

892
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">see what's not management review you</font>

893
00:35:50,800 --> 00:36:00,160
just clicking so that's pretty cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

894
00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:07,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so you've seen simple risk what do</font>

895
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:09,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think cool yeah all right so being</font>

896
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,810
security practitioners I think you guys

897
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,810
will appreciate the simple wrist was

898
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:15,369
designed with security in mind

899
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">parametrized database queries a las</font>

900
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:22,329
input validation HTML output encoding

901
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,859
hashed passwords it's capable of doing

902
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:26,530
end to your architecture so you can have

903
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:29,049
a separate database and apt here full

904
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,339
audit trail not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in the configure</font>

905
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,680
section for the admin but each

906
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:37,599
individual risk keeps track of it so not

907
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,220
true it's free it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source Mozilla</font>

908
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,780
public license to point out which

909
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:44,799
basically means if you want to take my

910
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:47,050
work and sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can like I said</font>

911
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier I got a lamp installation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guide</font>

912
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,069
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run linux apache my</font>

913
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:54,940
seat<font color="#CCCCCC"> home PHP you can have this up and</font>

914
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:56,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">running in less than an hour and if you</font>

915
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,819
want simple risk if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what you</font>

916
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,069
see here but you're like Josh I don't

917
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:03,369
know PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll know these mice equals</font>

918
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:05,200
things i have posted wristcom<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

919
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,450
want to spend any more time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

920
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,149
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure it</font>

921
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,399
handles all the patching and the updates

922
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,230
and everything else right so if you're

923
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,210
if you're not technical or you don't

924
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,089
want to support those things I can take

925
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,490
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff for you yeah we</font>

926
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:24,609
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> last cup so with that that</font>

927
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,140
is simple risk I have stickers up here

928
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:28,390
if anybody would like a simple wrist

929
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,859
sticker I have some cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well if you</font>

930
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch with me or whatever</font>

931
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,670
but are there questions do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want</font>

932
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:38,490
to know more do you want to see more

933
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:40,930
what you guys want yeah

934
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:44,080
you may have set this<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it's busy</font>

935
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,390
feeding<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm catch every word but is</font>

936
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,210
there a reporting mechanism reporting

937
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:51,910
mechanism so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the reporting</font>

938
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,890
under here we have our risk dashboard we

939
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,259
have multiple different views so if you

940
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,879
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see all my open risk all risk</font>

941
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered for projects ends like that</font>

942
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,070
we do have the ability to see those

943
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,799
there is no reporting output mechanism

944
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,690
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking with my buddy nate</font>

945
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,339
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using simple risk</font>

946
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,810
in his environment and one of the

947
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:13,869
requests that he has is kind of an

948
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,580
export to PDF form and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

949
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:17,440
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that that's interesting</font>

950
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,080
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cool to be able to</font>

951
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,730
like email an exact here's a PDF here's

952
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,859
all your risk yours the mitigation that

953
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'd like to do way you think kind of</font>

954
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:27,910
thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that that we're going</font>

955
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do more of that stuff I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

956
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,420
other pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality that I</font>

957
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> build in there I have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

958
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,890
modules here to that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do charge</font>

959
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,910
for for more air prize functionality

960
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,490
there's a Active Directory

961
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,200
authentication and there's a team based

962
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,720
separation where it actually takes each

963
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,339
team and silos them off so that they can

964
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">only see the risk for the teams that are</font>

965
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:49,750
assigned to but i'm charging next to

966
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,180
nothing for those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> too it's just</font>

967
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,240
something to help make the wife happy

968
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,830
really but yeah I think reporting is

969
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,680
something I'm spending a lot more time

970
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,980
on these days and I do plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> on building</font>

971
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,098
quite a bit more into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool</font>

972
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:09,069
other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so</font>

973
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:10,869
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my fault for virginia VS</font>

974
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:14,380
once you know what you are sorry but

975
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:16,479
then do you think you need some sort of

976
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,789
interface to your methodology for

977
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:21,779
actually coming up with the risks<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

978
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you some money too and</font>

979
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:25,809
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to approach to thinking about</font>

980
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,599
you know what am I that's a lot of own

981
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:32,380
abilities I'll just say without you list

982
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:36,069
and then I can go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah but I needs</font>

983
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:40,239
to be some you know feedback you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

984
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:41,859
be our Jake so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do we</font>

985
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,499
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> more structure in terms of the</font>

986
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:46,119
risk intake process and one of the other

987
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:49,689
challenges with this lowest notes

988
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,609
database that we had is that our options

989
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,890
were to lock it down to specific people

990
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:56,769
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are risks after all</font>

991
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,598
or make it wide open and we couldn't

992
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wide open so we choose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

993
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,589
lock it down but then then the question

994
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:05,019
came well who do we allow to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

995
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:07,720
should my eunuch savin see the network

996
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:10,808
team risk right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately the</font>

997
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,879
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made is no we we don't</font>

998
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:15,249
want that so what we had is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

999
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,109
individual team managers who are able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1000
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:18,910
see this but now even the manager of

1001
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:21,249
that team can see the other teams rest

1002
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,950
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there ends up being how did</font>

1003
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:26,379
this problem there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1004
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,239
the individual contributors the people

1005
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,609
who actually hold these risks right now

1006
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,410
I couldn't give them access to some into

1007
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:33,999
this database without giving them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1008
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,489
access to view into the database and

1009
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:39,009
that's a problem so the the thing i want

1010
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do with simple risk is I want to kind</font>

1011
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:43,839
of create that framework where anybody

1012
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:48,670
could really<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and submit ribs right so</font>

1013
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:51,369
I have in here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to lock down</font>

1014
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,680
for each individual user you can define

1015
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:55,299
what they're able to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1016
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,368
all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> users in my environment</font>

1017
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:59,440
all they're able to do is submit ribs

1018
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:01,599
right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that they can go in</font>

1019
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they can self assess they can go in</font>

1020
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they can enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their own risks into</font>

1021
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:07,479
the system and then me as the security

1022
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:09,369
practitioner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have access to the</font>

1023
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:12,129
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and I can help guide them</font>

1024
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,380
down that process the my directors and

1025
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,880
my BP have access to

1026
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,790
whole thing so they can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

1027
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,190
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but each individual contributor</font>

1028
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,720
can contribute their own wrists they see

1029
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:23,970
we have the the team based separation

1030
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,000
extra so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able only see the risk</font>

1031
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:29,850
within those teams and it becomes kind

1032
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,070
of this there's the silo right each team

1033
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,720
comp has their own walls up<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1034
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:34,950
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time management kind of knocks down</font>

1035
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,350
those walls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have visibility</font>

1036
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,870
into everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right it's that kind</font>

1037
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:43,259
of answer your question a little bit so

1038
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:45,240
the idea is is push towards the self

1039
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,820
intake allow them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit their own</font>

1040
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk and then as your professional you</font>

1041
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,910
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to guide them if you find</font>

1042
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
other risks in the environment through

1043
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,810
your tools or whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can</font>

1044
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,210
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the idea is really convinced</font>

1045
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,860
them to self-identify because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1046
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,870
get bought in like i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1047
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,730
that CYO a approach they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1048
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,430
submit lots of risk your job is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1049
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:09,970
be how to fill through this here and

1050
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:13,279
some guidance to on how to you know

1051
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:16,430
identifying document us in a fashion

1052
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,650
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> any common uses a completely</font>

1053
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:21,560
different methodology to absolutely yeah

1054
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:23,870
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this doesn't completely abstract</font>

1055
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,640
the security practitioner right it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1056
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,339
provides a framework for you to work

1057
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them through and if the idea is hey</font>

1058
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,940
I want them to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> their risk but</font>

1059
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,430
then I sit down and I scheduled mean and

1060
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:38,390
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's cool right we can</font>

1061
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:41,600
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how does like simple</font>

1062
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:44,150
relate to the standards and laws that

1063
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliant said things like</font>

1064
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:50,190
like that is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship and</font>

1065
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:52,109
it helped with that so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1066
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:57,030
the simple risk relate to any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1067
00:42:52,109 --> 00:43:00,150
standards or lie laws like socks yes and

1068
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:02,640
no I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I there's to my knowledge</font>

1069
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,800
there is no socks requirement that you

1070
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,839
stand up a risk assessment program I

1071
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,329
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCI says that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1072
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,670
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a risk assessment program they</font>

1073
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:14,670
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you have to do you know</font>

1074
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:17,460
scan your environment via a tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a</font>

1075
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,500
qsa you know once a year or once a

1076
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">report right so it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

1077
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,050
that but what it does do is it creates a

1078
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,420
structure of structured format for you

1079
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,849
to go to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> any issues that you do</font>

1080
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,349
find via those processes and actually go

1081
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:33,510
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and follow through with</font>

1082
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:36,210
mitigation and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that management</font>

1083
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:38,069
is aware of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as I</font>

1084
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,599
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no requirement and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1085
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:42,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of those that you have to</font>

1086
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,579
disclose to the Assessors you know

1087
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,040
here's my risk it may help with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1088
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,710
like SAS 70 or you know something like

1089
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,349
that if you if you have to disclose to

1090
00:43:49,710 --> 00:44:02,549
customers those contacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> GLBA yeah other</font>

1091
00:43:55,349 --> 00:44:05,359
questions there's your risk appetite you

1092
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:08,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop your streaming out of seats</font>

1093
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,670
very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the question is at</font>

1094
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:14,040
national instruments does our risk

1095
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,260
appetite drive the policies and

1096
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,270
procedures and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

1097
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,560
could probably go into a you know we

1098
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,810
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk for an hour about</font>

1099
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,960
how n eyes culture has influenced our

1100
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:28,230
security program I mean they're very

1101
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,819
engineering oriented we have a lot of a

1102
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:34,349
tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk for an hour</font>

1105
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,720
down desktops you know removing admin

1106
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,328
privileges and things like that just

1107
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,990
aren't an option so absolutely you know
