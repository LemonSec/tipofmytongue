1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:23,119
how's everyone doing today that that

2
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,130
intro took about half of my time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotta really roll through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide so</font>

4
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,450
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here today I want to talk a little</font>

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,650
bit about development alphabet soup it's

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,780
just kind of a bunch of random stuff

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,730
that I don't want to be a whiner I don't

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,140
want to be a complainer but frankly I'm

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,839
tired of seeing a lot of these common

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,400
mistakes in mobile applications that i'm

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,680
reviewing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i kind of wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go over</font>

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,600
a few of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I see not only</font>

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,860
from a development perspective but also

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,410
from a mobile device management

15
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,120
perspective we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it way too hard</font>

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,739
on ourselves and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to go over</font>

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,290
some real simple solutions to some of

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,870
these issues this is me he<font color="#E5E5E5"> already went</font>

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,450
over a lot of that so let's talk with

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,890
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile app sex so obviously</font>

21
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:04,850
there's mobile mobile top 10 30 wasps

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,170
it's been around for a while there's

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:08,300
going to be a refresh next year which is

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty awesome but I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,979
about kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top five areas that</font>

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,570
I'm seeing and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some real you</font>

27
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:16,640
know simple things that you can do as a

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,770
developer to maybe mitigate some of the

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,530
issues that I continually see in

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,750
applications I review obviously sense of

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,600
data protection I think for most people

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,910
is the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that we face with</font>

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,979
mobile mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because these devices are</font>

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,350
easily lost or stolen I think all of us

35
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:36,140
understand that you know I can easily

36
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave it in a cab in my rental car and</font>

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,429
Starbucks maybe if I'm out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bar</font>

38
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,880
drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> too much like Jack last night</font>

39
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:46,280
but that happens right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch top 10</font>

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,190
breaks it down into both transport and

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,869
storage of sensitive data I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

42
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,220
of lump it all into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one area because at</font>

43
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:55,700
the end of the day is protecting

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,700
sensitive data server side controls for

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,229
some reason we've kind of forgotten

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,959
about server side controls when in fact

47
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,459
we should remember them right so we're

48
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,470
taking these steel buildings that we've

49
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">created for years our web applications</font>

50
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,280
and opening them up to these mobile apps

51
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,280
through web services or however else

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,660
where we're giving users access so it's

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we're slapping these wooden doors</font>

54
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,859
now on our steel building and why are we

55
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that so I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a few</font>

56
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those that I see quite a bit</font>

57
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,000
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization obviously</font>

58
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,430
those issues are continuing because a

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,230
lot of a lot of the built-in OS

60
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,629
mechanisms

61
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,909
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well understood when we're</font>

62
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,640
doing client-side development and this

63
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:38,560
whole client-server notion is something

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,089
we did 15 years ago and it's kind of

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,650
back right that's what a mobile app is

66
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,930
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part it's a client-server</font>

67
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,760
app section management's an interesting

68
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,489
one and we'll talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,290
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we're used to using our</font>

70
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,970
job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in sessions r dot net</font>

71
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,950
built-in sessions but what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do when</font>

72
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">we move to objective-c and we're using a</font>

73
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,488
Java back in how do we manage the

74
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,409
session between the two and broken

75
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,010
crypto and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's not broken it's</font>

76
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,359
just misused or implemented incorrectly

77
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,030
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of that when it</font>

78
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to mobile apps so let's dig right</font>

79
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,430
in protecting sensitive data obviously

80
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the focus most of the</font>

81
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,390
applications that I'm assessing for

82
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,459
organizations this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what they</font>

83
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,260
want an idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their data there if</font>

84
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,879
there is where is it going how long is

85
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,470
it there is it being destroyed properly

86
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:28,179
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it encrypted yadda yadda yadda so the</font>

87
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is is you know we have</font>

88
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,359
these devices there's many many many

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,720
protocols how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we secure them I've</font>

90
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:39,819
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apps that changed the way</font>

91
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,370
they're talking based on what protocols

92
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,988
being used there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one that it</font>

93
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,180
specifically checked if there was Wi-Fi

94
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,919
access and they use SSL but if it was

95
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,919
cellular access we'll turn off as a cell

96
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,329
and not use it because that's safe right

97
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,430
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not let's not do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore so</font>

98
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:59,590
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we protect data obviously SSL</font>

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,599
there's been ways that the SSL is broken

100
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,519
but it's better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it at all</font>

101
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,130
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the biggest issue that I see</font>

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:11,410
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mobile perspective is mobile</font>

103
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,819
applications I'm assessing do not prompt

104
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,069
the user when there's a bad certificate

105
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,048
so you know if i connect my Bert proxy

106
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all sudden I'm proxying traffic</font>

107
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,380
without saying yes except<font color="#E5E5E5"> surf or</font>

108
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,740
installing my certificate on the mobile

109
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">device why is that a bad thing well you</font>

110
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,070
know researchers found tons and tons of

111
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">these types of flaws and Android apps</font>

112
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,669
recently they looked at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

113
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,250
hundred and fifty or excuse me 13,500

114
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,229
applications the free ones in the

115
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,880
Android App Store and most of them were

116
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,190
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl either wrong they weren't</font>

117
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
requiring<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL or they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just allowing</font>

self

119

sign certificates we think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,969
and we're like well that's not a big

121
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but remember I could going around</font>

122
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,330
I'm connecting automatically to

a rogue AP with the same name and a

126
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,910
proxy I'm screwed all my data is going

127
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,760
over it and my mobile app doesn't care

128
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,890
and there's some easy ways to prevent

129
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,039
this but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reason we're not doing</font>

130
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> android you can set the</font>

131
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,960
hostname verifier now that being said

132
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,270
this setting browser compatible hostname

133
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,130
verifier is default right its default

134
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,310
now and more recent versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

135
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,320
but me being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy am i still</font>

136
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,910

137
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,190
because what happens when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google changes</font>

138
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,380
it they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> known to do that Apple</font>

139
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,150
does it to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded in your app</font>

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you're doing the appropriate</font>

validation where you're making

142
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,609
connections through SSL make sure that

143
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,320
it's validating the cert not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font>

144
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,920
the host name but everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else that's</font>

155
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:08,500
most the time no development right it's

156
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,510
a whole lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to set this</font>

157
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,790
when i'm using the simulator because

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,920
frankly adding myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensor for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

159
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,260

162
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,480
of a device and put it into your

163
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,620
simulator to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it now</font>

164
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,560
there's some scripting that'll that'll

165
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,540
add it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but i set this so i can</font>

166
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,950
test so i can do some development what

167
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,990
happens when that's forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">about before this one I'm seeing a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">more to continue without credential for</font>

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,640
authentication challenge this is used

174
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,080
primarily with web views and such so if

175
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,419
there's prefetching and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

176
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,340
with web use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times this will</font>

177
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,560
bypass those certificate warnings as

178
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,109
well

179
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,910
so don't use these I know even

180
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">involvement it makes it easy but add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

and the simulator instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir pinning</font>

183
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm seeing more and more of this I think</font>

184
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a good idea you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a bait</font>

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,910
going back and forth whether or not it's

186
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,070
a good idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like it there's some</font>

187
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,169
good code ah no<font color="#CCCCCC"> us for both iOS and</font>

188
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,330
Android I check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

189
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,010
some syrup inning<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously what that's</font>

190
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,630
doing is it's validating server and

191
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:25,070
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're talking to one</font>

192
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:27,500
another and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know through multiple</font>

193
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,750
different api's and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and iOS and</font>

194
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,669
Android now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where you'll have to</font>

195
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,810
create your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own trust manager on Android</font>

196
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they don't have anything really</font>

197
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,780
built in to do this sir pinning yet but

198
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">again I recommend it it makes it more</font>

199
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,520
difficult if you change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server cert</font>

200
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,130
and you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to push out a new app</font>

201
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,680
to all your users but for security

202
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:54,200
reasons it may be appropriate depending

203
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:57,560
on how security conscious you are so in

204
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,729
iOS this one still drives me nuts when

205
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,919
users hit the home button or switch

206
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,349
applications what happens take a

207
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,390
snapshot it hasn't changed in iOS 7

208
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,350
actually it's probably worse in my mind

209
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,330
because the way they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

210
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,260
background you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you double</font>

211
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,460
click the home button you can see all

212
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the apps that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are open those are</font>

213
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,810
snapshots of your last viewed screen

214
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,159
right what if that screen has something

215
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,590
like your credit card number your social

216
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,120
security number anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that may</font>

217
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,070
be sensitive to you now it's in a

218
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,979
snapshot if I had access<font color="#E5E5E5"> or root access</font>

219
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,320
to your file systems I have that it's a

220
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:29,180
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution though there's a couple</font>

221
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,340
delegate methods you could use to make

222
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,580
sure and change that screen to something

223
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:38,030
without sensitive data before it takes a

224
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,010
snapshot right and a lot of this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

225
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">built in OS functionality that you're</font>

226
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,580
not going to be able to change right but

227
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,580
you have to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

228
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,380
this one drives me completely up a wall

229
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,060
um the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords that are</font>

230
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,930
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored in preferences filed and</font>

231
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,339
plist files is staggering it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

232
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we don't think people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font>

233
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,930
access to the file system let's not do

234
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,370
this anymore don't you share preferences

235
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,050
for

236
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,029
swords with iOS pls obviously every

237
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,250
application has a default plist file and

238
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,310
its user defaults uses that now I've

239
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,010
seen passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored in this the</font>

240
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,199
default plist file<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll bet probably one</font>

241
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,060
in three apps that I look at and I think

242
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,040
I don't know what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> but developers</font>

243
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,859
might think that as user defaults is

244
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,719
memories space but it's actually storing

245
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,630
the data in a file that's on the file

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,950
system so if I have root access again i

247
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:39,279
can get at that information other one

248
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,800
auto correction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get sick of</font>

249
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,680
texting or emailing and it changes words

250
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,839
for you I do you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it off as a</font>

251
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,189
user but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then you're like well why</font>

252
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you auto correcting me anymore it's</font>

253
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:53,740
like this despite between yes and no

254
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,810
right well both iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android have storage</font>

255
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,700
mechanisms for this they do this because

256
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,349
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember you so if you</font>

257
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,810
continually type the same word or phrase

258
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's storing it either in a flat file on</font>

259
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,520
iOS or in a sequel light database on

260
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,730
Android now as a developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

261
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,620
understand this it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

262
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">autocomplete and so on in a browser this</font>

263
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,630
is stored forever in iOS for instance

264
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:20,500
it's synced my dynamic text<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

265
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,750
file is huge right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I've had an</font>

266
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,029
iOS device for years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years</font>

267
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I think it it just sings</font>

268
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,300
it back to my device yeah I think about

269
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing sense of</font>

270
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,250
data fields and don't turn auto

271
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,320
correction type to know it may possibly

272
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,240
save that data to those files again

273
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,760
persisted on the file system and not

274
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,339
controllable by your application so

275
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,410
objective-c is pretty simple set this

276
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,390
attribute type on your text fields and

277
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,910
you'll turn off that auto correction for

278
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,060
that specific field obviously browser

279
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,279
still an issue on mobile devices we have

280
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,550
mobile web browsers and autocorrect off

281
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,100
will do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Android</font>

282
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,609
androids its own Beast there's ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

283
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,500
turn this off through your layout XML or

284
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,630
in your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can set specific</font>

285
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:12,410
attributes on those text fields but it

286

<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't always work anyone know why and</font>

287
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:19,620
no well in Android you can have

288
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,740
different keyboards that keyboard may

289
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,120
not listen to these attributes now that

290
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">being said I still recommend setting</font>

291
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,529
them but just understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a business</font>

292
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,420
and organization that there may be some

00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:34,230
devices you know maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> swype doesn't</font>

295
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,079
so on so again it doesn't always<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

298
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:48,240
the most common things I'm seeing in

299
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,680
applications that I review you know I

300
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,000
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things right away and then</font>

301
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can dig into the</font>

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,899
real stuff but I think it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

303
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,420
things we completely have forgotten

304
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">about in mobile and it's time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end it</font>

305
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,430
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> step up to the plate again</font>

306
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,709
browser caching so mobile browser

307
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,140
caching is no different than browser

308
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,119
caching on your local laptop desktop

309
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,220
whatever else make sure to set the

310
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,890
responses appropriately for caching

311
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,420
sensitive data or not same thing you're

312
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,449
going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do a web review and</font>

313
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,269
you aren't sitting cache headers these

314
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,920
are still applicable in the mobile world

315
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,980
especially with things like your mobile

316
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">safari that's now getting synced I had</font>

317
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,899
one guy who did a review of his boss's

318
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,240

<font color="#E5E5E5">view tell me what's on it and so he sink</font>

320
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,949
that I cloud grabbed the iCloud sink and

321
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,470
applied it to his<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPad and he had</font>

322
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,760
everything from from his<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss's Safari</font>

323
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was already logged into</font>

324
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,540
gmail and all this other stuff so make

325
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,060
sure to set these cache control headers

326
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,349
appropriately because of issues like

327
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:55,589
that but if you have to store sensitive

328
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,910
data or store data at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that that you</font>

329
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,100
don't necessarily want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be around</font>

330
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,670
forever or sink right there's specific

331
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,560
locations on iOS to store that data

332
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,949
right so every application has their own

333
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,439
route library caches specifically will

334
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,510
not be sync to itunes or iCloud same

335
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,570
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the flash temp directory so</font>

336
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,449
if i connect say my my iphone to my

337
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,510
device I out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box can't get access</font>

338
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:24,750
to that but if I either jailbreak the

339
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,000
device or use a forensics tool more than

340
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,480
what

341
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,970
I will have access to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plist file</font>

342
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:36,940
without having to know the pass code but

343
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,470
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lantern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use but</font>

344
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,370
technically that's only available for

345
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:45,700
law enforcement so anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android we're</font>

346
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:47,230
good right yes perfect android doesn't

347
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,460
necessarily have specific locations

348
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,830
there's lots of syncing tools for

349
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Android you know Google Sync and</font>

350
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,250
anything else that you third party could

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,860
possibly download to sync your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

352
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,280
devices don't store anything on the SD

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,230
card that may be sensitive as the SD

354

cards world readable world writable to

355
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,810
any application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this is this</font>

356
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,340
is cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> right because now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can store to</font>

357
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,500
an SD<font color="#CCCCCC"> card that has tons and tons of</font>

359
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,860
if it's sensitive in nature at all and

360
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:20,680
store it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sandbox for</font>

361
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most part so what's this about a</font>

362
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,839
keychain obviously we hear a lot about

363
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,090
keychain max have keychains now there's

364
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,310
this weird random sync between iOS

365
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:33,730
devices and<font color="#CCCCCC"> max with Mavericks and an</font>

366
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,489
iOS 7 03<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't looked into that too</font>

367
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,100
much but so your iOS device has a

368
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,310
keychain it's used for storing keys user

369
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:46,120
names email addresses Wi-Fi information

370
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:48,910
passwords etc but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend it</font>

371
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,070
for anything that's highly sensitive it

372
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,500
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that an attacker could get</font>

373
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to either through an iTunes</font>

374
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,350
backup or by getting access to your

375
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,210
device itself specifically email

376
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,630
addresses so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance</font>

377
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:07,570
gmail does store your gmail account name

378
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,070
and your password in the keychain so if

379
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,890
I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump that keychain I can get</font>

380
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information not only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm still</font>

381
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,569
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this but if you delete your</font>

382
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:19,150
email account from your<font color="#CCCCCC"> device that</font>

383
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:21,700
information still remains in your

384
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">teaching not sure what so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got to look</font>

385
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,050
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that further but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

386
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,060
settings or attributes you can set on

387
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,849
these when you're setting them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

388
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,369
keychain this is the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> with iOS I</font>

389
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,800
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plus Kasich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

390
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,190
accessible when unlocked what that means

391
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,189
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

392
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,400
attribute or value or whatever is only

393
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,780
accessible once the user unlocks of

394
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,449
device with whatever passcode it is

395
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,880
right and then obviously a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

396
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,890
stronger this device only it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

397
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,110
device so even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sync it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to iCloud</font>

398
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,110
and I pull that that sink to another

399
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,150
device I have to re add that information

400
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,870
to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessible only to that</font>

401
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,160
device but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> caveat to this it</font>

402
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">only works if the device has a passcode</font>

403
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,750
set which you can't necessarily require

404
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,870
from your application right so you can't

405
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">rely on these attributes to work if the</font>

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,510
user just<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a wide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open device so this</font>

407
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of what it would look like so</font>

408
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just an SSID that i did a dump</font>

409
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,550
of a keychain and obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the</font>

410
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,120
account or the SSID and a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

414
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,520
what you're storing in there isn't

415
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,900
something that if lost is going to be

416
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,880
detrimental so always use<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL I think</font>

417
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,730
that's a no-brainer don't don't switch

418
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,290
back and forth right we vs SL long

419
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,170
enough it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really slowing your</font>

on use it don't store sensitive data

locally if possible if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,220
there's mechanisms to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll</font>

424
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,510
talk about that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I move on and then</font>

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously caching is something to think</font>

426
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,099
about both client server side and if

427
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:09,280
you're using any html5 or anything like

428
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:11,169
that as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> server side controls why</font>

429
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,310
is that still important this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

430
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,720
device I can't tell you the number of

431
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,669
organizations that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to me and</font>

432
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,370
say hey can you assess my mobile app I

433
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,470
say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine is it what kind of mobile</font>

434
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,899
app is it oh it's using web services net

435
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:24,910
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want the mobile access well</font>

436
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,560
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

437
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,000
to tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm just</font>

438
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,129
looking at the mobile app I might find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple things in your code maybe you're</font>

440
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,460
storing some sensitive data but I should

441
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,480
assess the whole thing right you should

442
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,510
have controls on the server side

443
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,780
authentication authorization sequel<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

444
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:42,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection xss which is still a problem</font>

445
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">in mobile apps and actually is more of a</font>

446
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,770
problem in mobile apps because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

447
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,260
local file system access

448
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,809
xss like you wouldn't in a browser so if

449
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">I try to reference a file through XSS</font>

450
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:55,770
with a browser I don't have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> due</font>

451
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:57,330
to sop right but in mobile apps if I'm

452
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">using WebKit webviews anything like that</font>

453
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,100
and the xss says hey I want this file as

454
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,500
long as the app has access to the file

455
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,879
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the file it's</font>

456
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunate but that's the way it works</font>

457
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,980
so don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget about your typical</font>

458
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,929
server side controls right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked</font>

459
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,059
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and years and years protecting</font>

460
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,220
our web apps and our other client server

461
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,330
apps and now we're slapping these mobile

462
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,250
apps in front of it and think we just

463
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,230
need to assess them if they're secure

464
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,600
we're secure no not necessarily right

465
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,510
because control should for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part</font>

466
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,490
still remain on the server side because

467
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,280
that's where we can control them right

468
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,809
and this this again this is number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

469
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,780
from what we're seeing an aspect when

470
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,610
we're assessing applications you know

471
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,918
poorly implemented server side controls

472
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,280
forgotten about server side controls and

473
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,350
so on so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it how do</font>

474
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,520
attackers do it same way we did it and

475
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:52,350
still do it today with web apps security

476
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,210
proxies guess what yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use them</font>

477
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:56,879
with mobile apps it's just web traffic

478
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,159
for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part right most mobile</font>

479
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,590
applications are using web service are

480
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,559
sending json requests are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

481
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,039
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml responses right all over HTTP</font>

482
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,010
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> https so these tools will still work</font>

483
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,840
and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them frequently jailbreaking</font>

484
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,220
routing tools there's tons and tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

485
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,030
them evasion will probably be out very

486
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,850
soon for<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS 7 you know they talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

487
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,590
it every day on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter we'll see</font>

488
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android you know it's basically 11 /</font>

489
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,330
device anymore it seems like but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

490
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,340
plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools to get root access to</font>

491
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,658
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices so you know when you're</font>

492
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,580
developing you got to understand that

493
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:34,380
that you're probably developing for a

494
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,600
device that's been compromised if you

495
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,159
want to call it compromised so you got

496
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,689
to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you're</font>

497
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,940
developing and then anything else you

498
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,700
know there's some apps such as good for

499
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,400
enterprise it uses UDP traffic don't

500
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,470
don't know why but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do so we can use</font>

501
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,659
other tools like Mallory or Wireshark to

502
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:56,820
analyze that network traffic alright any

503
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:59,100
questions on sets of data protection or

504
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,760
not and authentication

505
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,649
authorization so obviously there's a

506
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,350
couple different things there's the O

507
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,000
left side which the developers can't

508
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,760
really control and then there's the

509
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,620
application side right so apples added

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
this whole fingerprint sensing thing and

511
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,889
all that if you ask me<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not for</font>

512
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,830
security but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's convenience but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

513
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:24,450
don't do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore okay that's that's</font>

514
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,520
easy to say don't store passwords

515
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,950
locally there's no reason for it we're

516
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,799
doing remember me and mobile because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

517
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,809
don't want to put pressure on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

518
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,280
to have to type in a password well

519
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,770
they're typing and passwords on the web

520
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,168
why is this small computer any different

521
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,510
but it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they might</font>

522
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,570
have you know fat finger it more but

523
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:47,549
stop trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do remember me sure have</font>

524
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,960
longer sessions if that's what you want

525
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,059
like you know your face books and things

526
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,630
like that that have sessions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

527
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:56,820
for pretty much ever but don't store

528
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,840
their credentials or you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

529
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,399
case of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a banking app it not</font>

530
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,860
only doesn't store my credentials but I

531
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,990
have two things 1i register the device

532
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so I can only log in and their</font>

533
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,240
mobile app from me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my device and my</font>

534
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,650
mobile user name and password is

535
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,740
different than my web user name and

536
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:18,299
password so<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone compromises that</font>

537
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,650
they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to their mobile app</font>

538
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:21,679
and use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they haven't</font>

539
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,700
registered that mobile device to me and

540
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,860
they can't use it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web because</font>

541
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,640
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for mobile something to think</font>

542
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,530
about right so keychain don't store

543
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,299
passwords here either again I just

544
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">showed you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all that's in the clear</font>

545
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the most part if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to</font>

546
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,418
your keychain what about for those apps

547
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,700
that really want to store sensitive data

548
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,370
there's a couple mechanisms sequel light

549
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,169
or excuse me sequel<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher is a pretty</font>

550
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:52,168
good mechanism for for storing sensitive

551
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,700
data you still need some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of key you</font>

552
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:54,990
know how do you get that key maybe it's

553
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,419
something you require the user to type

554
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,610
in as a passcode but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're still</font>

555
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,880
require them to type something in or you

556
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,340
employ some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kept</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dec model like</font>

557
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,409
Good for Enterprise does like a lot of

558
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,750
your password managers do one password

559
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:12,000
and so on where they require a master

560
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,880
passkey for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> type it in which then</font>

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,140
unlocks your

562
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,300
disk encryption key and then together

563
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:20,890
they decrypt the data that's stored

564
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:22,389
locally right but here again you're

565
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:28,270
still requiring the user to type

566
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:30,160
something in so for server-side off use

567
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,950
the way you already have use your site

568
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,510
minders your SSL implementations custom

569
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,360
authenticators<font color="#CCCCCC"> to factor off whatever</font>

570
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using today for any sort of</font>

571
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,139
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it in the mobile</font>

572
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,150
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just another interface right</font>

573
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's another channel that you're</font>

574
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,320
opening up to your already established

575
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,240
infrastructure so continue to use that

576
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:54,760
infrastructure don't don't reinvent the

577
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,020
wheel so what about authorization right

578
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,910
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes hand in hand with</font>

579
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,100
authentication who you are and what you

580
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,560
can do there's two of them right OS

581
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,199
based an application based OS based is

582
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,629
different based on iOS and Android and I

583
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,890
focus on iOS and Android because frankly

584
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,180
if you tell yourself there's going to be

585
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,060
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next five years</font>

586
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,400
you're crazy right windows hasn't taken

587
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,040
off at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

588
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,720
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Firefox stuff yet but anything</font>

589
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,300
beyond iOS and Android I'm not sure yet

590
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,010
so iOS sandbox or<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat belt whatever you</font>

591
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,700
want to call it right so it's based on a

592
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,980
trusted vsd vsd<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac framework there's</font>

593
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">user space library functions for each of</font>

594
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,120
those sandboxes because<font color="#E5E5E5"> every app</font>

595
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,370
actually runs under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same user every</font>

596
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,639
app runs under the mobile user so they

597
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:45,040
have to segregate them somehow which the

598
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,650
sandboxing limits your app access to its

599
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,930
own file system so every app has their

600
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,630
own file system with a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-defined</font>

601
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:55,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">set of sub directories so when you</font>

602
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:57,250
install an app every app has this list

603
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,050
of sub directories and that's all that

604
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,730
it can technically access other than

605
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,190
maybe some shared resources and so on

606
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we'll we'll talk about that here so</font>

607
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,550
what about the permissions model so I've

608
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,040
installed my app it has access to its

609
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,510
file system but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get access to</font>

610
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,520
the camera or I want to access the

611
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,010
microphone maybe contacts photos

612
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,379
something else that app and the OS

613
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,660
specifically ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user hey can I have</font>

614
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,160
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and the user can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> click ok</font>

615
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,960
or don't allow the app will still

616
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,060
function or at least it should if you

617
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,290
click don't alone but once you've

618
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,870
clicked ok

619
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,879
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always on until you specifically</font>

620
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,290
turn it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the first one they</font>

621
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,420
implemented this with is location

622
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,300
services it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time they</font>

623
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,920
deploy a new version of iOS you know

624
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,610
they add another one I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

625
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">one was the microphone that was added as</font>

626
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:46,389
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no apps have to request</font>

627
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,780
access to use but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember you can</font>

628
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,220
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off but once you turn it on you</font>

629
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,790
have to turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to go off</font>

630
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,530
they don't ask every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single time android</font>

631
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,540
completely different models right when

632
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:01,600
it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the apps and how they run in</font>

633
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,220
the authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> authorization every</font>

634
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,159
app has its own user ID in this case

635
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,470
that's how they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> filesystem separation</font>

636
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,840
for each of the applications so that app

637
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">only has access to its file system but</font>

638
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,020
it's through their user ID not

639
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,330
necessarily through that sandboxing

640
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,770
technique that Apple uses shared

641
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,330
resources are handed handled by

642
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,310
permissions model which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously</font>

643
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,230
different than iOS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about</font>

644
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,480
that but what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooted devices</font>

645
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,900
obviously that completely destroys the

646
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,280
sandbox same thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS right and</font>

647
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,710
there's quite a few holes at that point

648
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,020
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I have a rooted device with with</font>

649
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Android the google play store has tons</font>

650
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,510
and tons of apps in them that need root

651
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,520
to work so me as a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

652
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,800
download download things like proxy

653
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,440
droid it allows me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to proxy traffic from</font>

654
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,720
a device it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have root access to</font>

655
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,420
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do that proxy so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

656
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,830
those from the app store right so think

657
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,390
about that when you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

658
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,659
developing but trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage these</font>

659
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,950
mobile devices as your organization so

660
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,180
the permissions model completely

661
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:06,670
different than iOS when you install an

662
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,730
app it requests the permissions that

663
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,710
that app needs all of them it was funny

664
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,110
someone deployed an app called all

665
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,210
permissions all I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was request every</font>

666
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,949
single permission in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android and it was</font>

667
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:22,300
downloaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> and installed like 10,000</font>

668
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,130
times why right users are not smart

669
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough to understand what these mean and</font>

670
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:28,660
even the crappy descriptions underneath

671
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,600
of them don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you what they</font>

672
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,270
mean but that's the model right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

673
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a yes or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no if you click no the app</font>

674
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,260
won't install<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if it did it</font>

675
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,730
wouldn't work right it needs all those

676
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,430
to actually function I

677
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,970
so be cognizant of what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only</font>

678
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,930
developing and asking users to approve

679
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,300
but when you're installing an

680
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,130
application on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your personal advice</font>

681
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,639
business device understand what some of

682
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:57,520
these mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a one of our</font>

683
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,900
engineers created an app that will look

684
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,670
at all the permissions and all the apps

685
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have installed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your device</font>

686
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:06,340
and kind of give them a rating I don't

687
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it on here yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

688
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,730
look for in the google play store if

689
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,140
you're interested doesn't do anything

690
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,030
else it just grabs<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information and</font>

691
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,780
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rating of each app</font>

692
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:18,790
and tells you some of the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

693
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:23,080
risky permissions that your apps are

694
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:25,270
asking for so obviously there's

695
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,790
different levels of access control<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

696
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're talking about application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

697
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would say most all these on the server</font>

698
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,460
side you know you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage access</font>

699
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,230
control locally on the client because

700
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,540
you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust it right there's</font>

701
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,180
presentation layer that one's a

702
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,830
usability option so it's different

703
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,800
screens you might show different buttons

704
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,290
you might show on your mobile app but in

705
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,050
the back end you need to sure validate

706
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,649
that sure Joe has access to delete Samms

707
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,909
account right and that's done through

708
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,010
multiple layers whether its environment

709
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,450
based URL based access control because

710
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember we're still talking over the</font>

711
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,580
web for the most part it's just no

712
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,080
different than our web apps you've got

713
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,120
controller you've got business logic

714
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,639
you've got data layer access control so

715
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,919
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access my data and you can</font>

remember put these on the server side

mere them<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramir the timeout sometimes we</font>

744

want you know shorter session time outs

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,460
with mobile apps because<font color="#E5E5E5"> users typically</font>

747
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:32,740
doing a bank transfer from their mobile

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:36,370
app something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so in iOS so</font>

749
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,710
what do we do right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the web world</font>

750
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:41,110
it's these session IDs or transfer

751
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,890
through cookies right so if I if I

752
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,929
request access i authenticate now I have

753
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,030
this session ID in it it sends it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cookie to my mobile app I got to</font>

755
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,800
store that somewhere because i'm not in

756
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,560
a browser now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a mobile client so</font>

757
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,909
where should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i store it iOS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say</font>

758
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first option would be in the</font>

759
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,790
keychain no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most secure</font>

760
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,840
option but at least with session IDs

761
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,450
they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point</font>

762
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,370
so even if i did get access to someone

763
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,530
else's keychain which had this session

764
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:14,350
ID in it hopefully by that point it's

765
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:16,270
been expired timed out right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font>

766
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,129
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and use it again so that</font>

767
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be my first option for iOS again</font>

768
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,290
to make sure to set this attribute that

769
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned before this device only is</font>

770
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:27,340
my preference especially for session IDs

771
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,860
you should never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use that on</font>

772
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:33,070
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> device second option stored in</font>

773
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,810
memory I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as much but</font>

774
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,939
it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit harder to get to the</font>

775
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,790
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> on an iOS device if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

776
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,590
have the access needed to do that and

777
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,750
third option which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recommend at</font>

778
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,610
all would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paid list files which</font>

779
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,550
frankly I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the time because</font>

780
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,010
it's easy distorted NS user defaults and

781
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,409
I can

782
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,120
and use it but store it in the keychain

783
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:56,120
I mean it's a real short amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code</font>

784
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,540
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hard to to stave and then</font>

785
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">retrieve android android has a keychain</font>

786
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,639
API but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

787
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,280
the iOS<font color="#CCCCCC"> side the keychain API is really</font>

788
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,370
for storing keys and certificates not

789
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,200
really for storing strings and and

790
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:15,050
passwords and values and such so you

791
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,020
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially use it to store a key</font>

792
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:20,450
or cert to encrypt the session ID but

793
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,830
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much work because</font>

794
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,310
the session ID isn't necessarily the

795
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:28,490
most sensitive piece but stored in

796
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:30,260
memory I feel a little bit more

797
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable with storing session IDs and</font>

798
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,150
memory now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android has implemented</font>

799
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,950
some other USB protections you know when

800
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,960
you turn on debugging and connect it to

801
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:41,560
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new computer you have to from the</font>

802
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,090
device tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> that computer that it's okay</font>

803
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,560
whereas before you didn't so I turned to

804
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,810
bugging unplugged in a new computer and

805
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">now i can jump memory and android</font>

806
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,429
actually has built-in tools for that so

807
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,600
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i still</font>

808
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,510
I'm a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable with</font>

809
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,070
the newer versions of Android because

810
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:04,400
it's more restrictive from the USB

811
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:05,629
connections crypto so first don't do

812
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,200
crypto on the client side if you don't

813

<font color="#CCCCCC">really have to crypto is best done very</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do it on the front end on</font>

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the client side there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

818
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,440
do it common problems that I'm coming

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">across figure to encrypt sensitive data</font>

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,550
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the number number one I</font>

821
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,530
see right I'm saving it locally I don't

822
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,850
encrypt it because no one get access to

823
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,820
it because it's locked down well that's

824
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,350
that's just not the case i would say the

825
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">best choice here is just don't send the</font>

store it their credential problems right

<font color="#CCCCCC">what to do with it right I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

841
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:15,218
then algorithm problems I've seen a lot

of roll-your-own in mobile and i'm not

00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,468
iterations which just slows down

857
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,359
guessing right i mean that's what the

858
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:59,999
iterations are for if someone really

859
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:02,109
wants to create a rainbow table attack

860
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,029
and they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of iterations</font>

861
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:05,708
they can do that it's not for preventing

862
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:08,768
that it's more for preventing that brute

863
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:10,359
force guessing than anything and there's

864
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,428
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this informations on the Olaf</font>

865
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,699
site it doesn't change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the mobile</font>

866
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:18,159
world you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continue to do</font>

867
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:19,989
that encryption obviously use some

868
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,419
strong algorithms you know everything

869
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:25,388
we've preached in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past continues to</font>

870
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:28,449
be preached entropy here's a good one

871
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:31,929
and get random number return for is done

872
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:33,598
by dice roll right that works actually

873
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:36,668
we've had some issues with entropy

874
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,369
specifically if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android anything</font>

00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be much better but if you're</font>

885
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,640
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make it a little bit more</font>

886
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,470
secure iOS the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC random copy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes is</font>

887
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,009
the only thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend it does use</font>

888
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,069
Deb random for the seating but don't use

889
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:18,010
these other ones

890
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:22,160
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely not not random enough</font>

891
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:24,860
so that's a mobile app sec I got just

892
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,160
very few minutes here so alphabet soup

893
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,870
what about mobility so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

894
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,490
mobile it's not just development anymore

895
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,200
it's this whole device right because

896
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,910
we're developing not only for our

897
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,220
external clients we're developing for

898
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,230
internal right so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage all</font>

899
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,020
that somehow so we've got all these

900
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,240
terms right BYOD would be the first one

901
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that came to mind you're not going to</font>

902
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,620
stop it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to have to</font>

903
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,480
embrace it everyone wants to use what

904
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:54,140
they want to use there's people who love

905
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,700
Android people who love ILS so establish

906
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,440
agreements with your employees right

907
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way to really go about</font>

908
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,080
establishing appropriate BYOD choose

909
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,120
your tool you've got to choose some tool

910
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,650
to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on what you</font>

911
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,710
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give employees access to through</font>

912
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,810
BYOD and lock out for any non-compliance

913
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,240
right they've agreed to something if

914
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,070
they jailbreak a<font color="#E5E5E5"> root their phone you</font>

915
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,509
tell them not to lock them out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't</font>

916
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,820
let them use it right they have their

917
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,040
choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their option to use it and</font>

918
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they didn't listen it's as simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

919
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,440
that really I can't tell you the number

920
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,620
of clients that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working with that</font>

921
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been working on BYOD and MDM for</font>

922
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,060
probably two years now and they're still

923
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,490
in pilot phases because they're fighting

924
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,380
back and forth you got to establish

925
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:42,830
those agreements I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

926
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,300
the biggest thing MDM is going to be a

927
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,210
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more restrictive right than</font>

928
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,360
BYOD some of the MDM tools you can use

929
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:53,330
for BYOD but if you want access to other

930
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,100
things like apps if you want to set pass

931
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,140
code requirements certain mobile

932
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,140

933
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,140

934
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,379
emphasis on route detection as most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

935
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,390
its by passable just because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact</font>

936
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,580
that MDM solutions are not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

937
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,430
root how can you detect root if you're

938
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,900
not running his route type of thing

939
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,810
remote wipe I think is something remote

940
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,280
white poison pill is something that

941
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,049
should definitely implement and then app

942
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,500
restrictions i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">most important aspect here that that</font>

organizations are struggling with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

947
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:35,170
management another alphabet soup issue

948
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:37,000
providing restrictions based on the

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,620
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device itself maybe the user of</font>

00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,190
connecting two different Wi-Fi access

953
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:48,070
work geolocation restrictions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see more</font>

954
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this where maybe your organization</font>

955
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:51,490
has some internal devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

956
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,620
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever want to leave the campus and</font>

957
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:55,330
if they leave the campus geolocation

958
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,279
will completely shut them down right

959
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,620
they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to anything you can't</font>

960
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">login and things like that something</font>

961
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:03,670
definitely to look at as far as you know

962
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,529
you're more sensitive devices maybe your

963
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,210
development devices a lot of times

964
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:09,040
there's a lot of restrictions on

965
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,050
development devices because there's new

966
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,550
code there's new projects and things

967
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">being deployed to them that they don't</font>

00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,880

969
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,710
mobile application management again this

970
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I think I would focus most of</font>

971
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,480
my time if I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at MDM solutions</font>

972
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,610
who provides the best solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

973
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,180
when they first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started developing MDM</font>

974
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,980
it was more of a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> OCH applications</font>

975
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,470
on an application basis so block this

976
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,570
PDF renderer block this Angry Birds at

977
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,859
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously in the security community</font>

978
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,840
we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work that's</font>

979
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,510
negative filtering right there's

980
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,580
millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps between Google Play and</font>

981
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,920
iOS you'd have to hire how many

982
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,930
full-time people just to manage what

983
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,610
apps you're restricted so that doesn't

984
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,810
work anymore you're going to have to do

985
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,480
it a little bit differently you're going

986
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:58,259
to have to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile device</font>

987
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,790
management vendors to to restrict those

988
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:05,830
two minutes so some<font color="#CCCCCC"> App Store issues</font>

989
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:07,990
right we have App Store issues these

990
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,509
these type of applications get into the

991
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,910
App Store that shouldn't you know apps

992
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">tethering apps were huge to begin with</font>

993
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't rely on App Store's to</font>

994
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:20,050
protect us we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand that</font>

995
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,700
functional risks this is one that you

996
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:23,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously there's open as i can</font>

997
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,569
open pdfs and multiple different things

998
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,430
MDM will help restrict that what about

999
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,490
things like color color uses the

1000
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,899
microphone

from a malware standpoint on the mobile

side yet because we still have sequel I

1032
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:47,450
my client base but what I'm seeing is

1033
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:51,560
there's different policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> BYD BYOD has</font>

1034
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:53,779
a policy multiple / flat platform so

seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a trend whether that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1039
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:07,369

1040
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:10,100
see same with corporate<font color="#CCCCCC"> mbms multiple /</font>

1041
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:12,710
platform-based mdms instead of saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">MobileIron is good for everything I'm</font>

differences in the mobile devices and

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:30,380
protect with MDM solutions we're that I

1048
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,850
don't think we have time for questions

1049
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,359
even though we had like a two minute

1050
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,359
break we get

1051
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,839
I'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in two weeks I'm</font>

00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:55,040
next week so for money you can find

God no no that's a restriction from

1058
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:18,190
aspect but I have plenty of devices that

1059
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:18,190
are anyone else went through really fast

1060
