00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright well thanks for being here is</font>

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,290
full<font color="#E5E5E5"> room I appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

3
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be talking today about quality</font>

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,290
assurance of penetration testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,110
sure it's a very popular topic among

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:35,700
penetration testers as one I know it's

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,440
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a popular topic um so and</font>

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,309
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the reasons basically</font>

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,629
why i wanted to do this there's the

10
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,220
outline so nobody laughed hey you guys

11
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,930
all from IBM or what I don't think

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're I don't think you're allowed to</font>

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,220
laugh at IBM I know you're not for rapid

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,220
seven because I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contact tap</font>

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,480
so anyways I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked for Lockheed</font>

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin have been there about 12 years I</font>

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,489
took a break and did some consulting for

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,180
a year and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

19
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,619
that and like you heard I'm also an

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,930
adjunct professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> at SMU have been</font>

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,910
teaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for a while and teach</font>

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,180
mostly graduate courses in software

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,310
security I do some cissp like courses

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,320
and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowadays i spend</font>

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,630
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of my time doing training and</font>

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,220
education in security which if your

27
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity you probably do too because</font>

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,330
the field is growing so fast that if you

29
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:36,630
know anything about security you're

30
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:41,100
obligated to teach other people so let's

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,759
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm here basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">job I love what I do it's a it's a great</font>

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,080
job when you tell people about what you

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,640
do they're usually pretty one of the big

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,110
comments i always get is wow that really

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,450
sounds cool you get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have computers</font>

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,710
for a living and I say well yeah some of

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">my time you know a lot of our time is</font>

39
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,350
spent doing other things but but yeah I

40
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,640
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do love my job one of what other</font>

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,449
what other field can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:13,530
you do penetration testing well maybe

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:16,049
there's a few others but oh anyways so

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,030
yeah I'm here because I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

45
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:19,769
feel better I feel like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

46
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,780
fields growing so fast there's so many

47
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:23,880
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of coming into penetration</font>

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,170
testing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the I would say in</font>

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,780
my experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entry-level</font>

50
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,230
like jobs for security as you come in

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,560
and you do

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,869
security testing or penetration testing

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,629
and I've started to see some trends that

54
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,049
are alarming maybe you've noticed some

55
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,298
of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but some some things</font>

56
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,040
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping we you know as a</font>

57
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,190
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> can kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of deal with before</font>

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,929
it becomes too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know people</font>

59
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,310
already argue that some security is

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,680
snake oil you know we're selling things

61
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,390
that don't work or or you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't</font>

63
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,690
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't we don't want that to</font>

64
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,599
continue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want that to get</font>

65
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">worse and with a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lot of these</font>

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,500
trends that I'm seeing in New

67
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,750
penetration testers or even pen testers

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,680
that you know just haven't quite learned

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,510
the craft or are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe getting lazy</font>

70
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,459
or I don't know there's several issues

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,840
that we'll talk about and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

72
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,489
all the answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the issues I'm</font>

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,260
just trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start the discussion and</font>

74
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,510
hope that people will kind of jump on

75
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,280
board and realize that quality in

76
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,540
penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> testing is an important</font>

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing and so that's that's really why</font>

78
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,069
I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh and I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say the</font>

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,260
views expressed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

80
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,940
don't necessarily reflect the views of

81
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,880
my employers past or present blah blah

82
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">blah if that really works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that</font>

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,870
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> works like I didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'd</font>

84
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,510
still get fired right<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i said</font>

85
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,900
something maybe if Snowden would have

86
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:56,099
known that and put that in this video so

87
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's see why are you here so hopefully</font>

88
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,880
here you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> here maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

89
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,190
commissioning a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin test or an</font>

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,739
assessment or you have in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past or</font>

91
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,359
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the future</font>

92
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:08,040
and this talk is for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you</font>

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of understand some things you</font>

94
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,870
should watch out for some red flags

95
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,480
hopefully some questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

96
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,399
ask when you're seeking penetration

97
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,279
testing or talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a consulting firm</font>

98
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,750
or something like that perhaps you're

99
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,030
undergoing a security audit this is

100
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,260
becoming more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more prevalent in the</font>

101
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,559
industry especially if you work in

102
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,270
defense and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> and banking where you</font>

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,070
have third parties coming in not to do

104
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,409
an assessment to help you fix problems

105
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,729
they're coming in to do an audit so

106
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,130
they're coming in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing penetration</font>

107
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,960
testing just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you were</font>

108
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,250
doing

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,229
what you're supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

110
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,819
looking for flaws and we've had we've

111
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,050
had that happen several times over the

112
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,729
last two years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where this</font>

113
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,250
presentation actually came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is</font>

114
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,340
those security audit activities done by

115
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,990
third parties usually sponsored by you

116
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,080
know some government organization

117
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,910
wanting to come in and do an audit or

118
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,560
they like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cnas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's ever</font>

119
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,990
been through a cna or had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font>

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,599
cna so they're starting to add security

121
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,490
audit security penetration testing those

122
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,530
kinds of things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cna activities</font>

123
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,030
typically it used to be they would come

124
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,380
in and ask a bunch of questions or they

125
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,690
would look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at paperwork or something</font>

126
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,419
like that but we've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had several</font>

127
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,020
teams of penetration testers come in to

128
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,880
programs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and work for</font>

129
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,400
and do their own assessments and then

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,900
basically you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hold the hold the</font>

131
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,698
contractor in my case my company

132
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,380
responsible for those findings so they

133
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,830
develop a thing called a poem anybody

134
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever heard of a poem and it's basically</font>

135
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can a quite poem with a finding but</font>

136
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,409
it stands for plan of action and

137
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,870
mitigation I think is that is the term

138
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,219
but really when I say poem have you they

139
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,139
treat<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like a finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

140
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,330
finding and you get so many days to work

141
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:52,340
those off based on high medium low those

142
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,370
types of things and if you don't there

143
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,979
are consequences to your program or your

144
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,479
budget or something like that so like I

145
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,219
said a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the a lot of this talk</font>

146
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,719
comes from these activities that I'm

147
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,940
saying where we are working with outside

148
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:06,620
penetration testing teams that have been

149
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,780
hired usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party some freelance</font>

150
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,680
consulting things like that smaller

151
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,138
consulting firms that have come in and

152
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,310
we've worked with the other reason you

153
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,639
might be here is get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pen tester and</font>

154
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy getting roasted I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

155
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,979
to I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roasting I'm</font>

156
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,500
just kidding maybe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little recent</font>

157
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,940
trends so I already talked about number

158
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,250
of security assessments increasing for

159
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,009
various reasons because security is hot

160
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,979
right now so when I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

161
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,570
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those but some of the things</font>

162
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did want to mention is that we have</font>

163
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,770
seen in these audits and assessments as

164
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,449
high as twenty-five percent false

165
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,549
positive rates from some third-party

166
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,099
assessments that's a really really high

167
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,020
number we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect in most of the</font>

168
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">teams I've worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consultant</font>

169
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,310
solving firms that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

170
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,340
or you expect almost no false positives

171
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,510
in a final report coming from a set of

172
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,390
security consultants who have looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

173
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,010
it and reviewed it and things like that

174
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,360
if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a false positive maybe that</font>

175
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know you've state that there's a</font>

176
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
chance in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the report that there</font>

177
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a false positive based on</font>

178
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,510
these factors or whatever but just

179
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,370
blatant things that are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

180
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's typically you know you don't want</font>

181
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a security assessment</font>

182
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:24,110
especially you know any inequality and

183
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing that we see that's</font>

184
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,910
really alarming is that false positives

185
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,650
and over ranked findings are costing

186
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,590
programs significant amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

187
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,789
what do I mean by over ranked findings

188
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,869
what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I couldn't think of a</font>

189
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,600
better word<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that but basically</font>

190
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">ranking priorities of findings in in a</font>

191
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,310
in consistent manner or over ranking

192
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,349
them because the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

193
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">assessor feels like they want this thing</font>

194
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,320
fixed so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing a risk</font>

195
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,729
assessment on your program these guys

196
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,650
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing they were</font>

197
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,240
doing penetration tests they don't know

198
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,919
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your system and the risk</font>

199
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,080
profile and threat factors and all of

200
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,640
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically know what they're</font>

201
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,159
seeing on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> web application or this</font>

202
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,500
network scan and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

203
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,210
arbitrary decisions on finding ratings

204
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,790
sometimes arbitrary sometimes they're

205
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,520
passed down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them by the customer by</font>

206
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,800
the weather it be you know DoD or DHS or

207
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,599
somebody like that it says we rank these

208
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,419
findings like this always without

209
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,120
looking at risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> factors at all the</font>

210
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,650
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you end up spending</font>

211
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,150
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we talk about risk</font>

212
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,710
analysis all the time we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk</font>

213
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,200
mitigation it's all about you know

214
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,719
spending as much money as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes two</font>

215
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mitigate the risk so that you're not</font>

216
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,349
overspending you're not spending more on

217
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,729
your risk mitigation then it would have

218
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,539
cost you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place if the thing</font>

219
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,160
had been exploited so it's an important

220
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,250
factor in security and it's one that is

221
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">often missed in in these security audits</font>

222
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:50,470
and so an example of that I'll give is

223
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:54,770
we have we've had risk or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a finding</font>

224
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,750
we'll call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a HTTP 580 TP 500 error</font>

225
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,850
messages right so some people will call

226
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that information leakage anybody ever</font>

227
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,730
written up an information leakage on an

228
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,750
HTTP 500 depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's in it right</font>

229
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,460
stack traces

230
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,380
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come back and you get</font>

231
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,210
some information about the website that

232
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,660
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't have or the</font>

233
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:16,490
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't be giving out</font>

234
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,380
but I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually seen these findings</font>

235
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,480
written up in cases where there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

236
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,280
a HTTP 500 that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all there was no extra</font>

237
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,170
information and it had the standard

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,319
generic message no stack trace anything

239
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,969
like that and that the customer was

240
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,790
consistent or this third-party Assessor

241
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,840
was consistently ranking these high so

242
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go spend money</font>

243
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,860
immediately because you only got like 30

244
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,540
days or 60 days to go fix this thing so

245
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,020
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go fix all these HTTP 500</font>

246
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,410
is HTTP HTTP 500 necessarily a security

247
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,350
risk no right it's part of the HTTP spec

248
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,459
for a reason it's supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it's</font>

249
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's something</font>

250
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad happened that an error message</font>

251
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,630
happened if you've got something else

252
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,520
watching for error messages and you're

253
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,990
not getting HTTP 500 so then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

254
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,870
know they're there you can't deal with

255
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,880
them and literally the mitigation for

256
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,790
this was Kajal please just change these

257
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,710
to http 200 okays and just put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

258
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,900
message that was on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 just put it</font>

259
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,700
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 200 so you're changing the you're</font>

260
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,459
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the error code but you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

261
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,950
changing the error message at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all and so</font>

262
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,290
we we spent significant amounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

fixing<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi finding we couldn't talk them</font>

264
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,790
down either we tried i wrote white paper

after<font color="#E5E5E5"> white paper saying explaining why</font>

266
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,670
this is not a security risk that we

267
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,790
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know you can put it</font>

268
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,810
informational whatever you want but this

269
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't something we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be dealing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with on a high basis this is us having</font>

and it's it's not a good practice and

285
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:07,820
they will they will stop hiring you once

286
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,860
they figure out unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> an auditor</font>

287
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:15,580
and then you really can't you know the

288
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,580
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to decide but</font>

289
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:22,790
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend that we've seen is the</font>

290
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,730
people coming into penetration testing I

291
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,250
think often misunderstand misunderstand

292
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,500
the craft or misunderstand the area and

293
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,630
i'm a professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a teacher I love to</font>

294
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,520
teach I have nothing against inviting

295
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,790
people you know into the community I'm

296
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,709
not an elitist I teach for a reason

297
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,719
because i love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love when students</font>

298
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,189
eyes are open to the way penetration

299
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,140
testing work so the way the security

300
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,120
works and the first time they ever use

301
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,529
an HTTP proxy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like oh my god</font>

302
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">i didn't know you could even do this to</font>

303
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,689
a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's cool for me to see</font>

304
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that light</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bulb go on in their head so</font>

305
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,709
that's not what this is about well this

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is about as I interview people who say</font>

307
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:02,959
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't penetration testers who have</font>

308
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,270
certifications things like that but they

309
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,349
lack<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical foundation you ask</font>

310
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,120
them if they've ever programmed before

311
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,570
and they're like well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done</font>

312
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little scripting or how I usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

313
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,260
have you ever done any professional

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,730
program before not that that's a

315
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,990
technical requirement for being a

316
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,430
penetration tester but it certainly

317
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,410
helps they have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

318
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,479
technical foundation programming systems

319
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,480
administration networking<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have to</font>

320
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,709
understand the way things work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order</font>

321
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do penetration testing it's an</font>

322
00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:31,550
important piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it does require a</font>

324
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:38,060
technical knowledge and skill and when

325
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,620
you come in lacking those things it just

326
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes really hard for you to</font>

cause the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen the</font>

things that are important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

comprehensive job on a penetration test

334
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:58,430
they expect you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this level of</font>

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,810
technical foundation and in some of the

336
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,260
interviews I've done recently I've

337
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,000
interviewed people that couldn't answer

338
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,860
some simple questions and these are real

339
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,570
questions that I've asked people who say

340
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,730
that claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be penetration testers and</font>

341
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,430
they want a job on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our team or at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

342
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,470
maybe a cissp or something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

343
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,569
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an answer what's the</font>

344
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference between TCP and UDP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

345
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,390
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask these questions after they tell</font>

346
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">me something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah I do network</font>

347
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,050
penetration testing or I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done network</font>

348
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,430
scanning before and I'm like okay you've

349
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,990
done scanning can you tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

350
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,459
technical difference between these two

351
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:33,740
protocols and there

352
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:36,770
like well isn't one of them something

353
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,260
about a connection or and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

354
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the way it works and so yeah that</font>

355
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,340
that interview usually ends pretty quick

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,720
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who tells me that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there it's</font>

357
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">this admin or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

358
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux hosts file does</font>

359
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,520
and what are the some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the security</font>

360
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,200
concerns with<font color="#E5E5E5"> host files and and things</font>

361
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,460
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like um yeah I</font>

362
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> once I've talked about that</font>

363
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,120
doesn't have something to do with

364
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet addressing or DNS or something</font>

365
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,050
so and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else will tell me</font>

366
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,070
they are software<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and they</font>

367
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,569
can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the difference from the</font>

368
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,890
stack on the heap which is not none of

369
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are really security questions</font>

370
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:10,010
these are just technical you know basic

371
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,600
technical questions that that we should

372
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to answer if we claim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

373
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,880
doing this type of work so that's that's

374
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:19,100
been alarming not to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,330
can't pick this up and learn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

376
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that when you call yourself a</font>

377
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,780
professional penetration tester there

378
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,240
are some basic skills that really should

379
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,670
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's a basic a technical</font>

380
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,240
foundation that I feel is lacking in a

381
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,310
lot of cases so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to go over some</font>

382
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top mistakes that that I've seen</font>

383
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,119
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last two two and a half years</font>

384
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,949
that I've been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing where</font>

385
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we get to my team kind of</font>

386
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,630
overseas audits a lot so we oversee

387
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,940
these these government auditors or other

388
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,800
auditors that come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do security</font>

389
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing against these programs and so</font>

390
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,880
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to kind of vet the findings</font>

391
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,170
so they give them to us the the program

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,700
doesn't know what these findings mean

393
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,640
they're not security people typically so

394
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,350
they the programs i mean the findings

395
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,150
and reports come to my team my team

396
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,530
analyzes them and says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's what</font>

397
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,069
we need to do to get all this stuff

398
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:09,140
fixed and what we found is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were</font>

399
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,310
spending a lot of time having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to weed</font>

400
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,100
out false positives with these

401
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,160
penetration tests and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then some of the</font>

402
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons for that would be a lack of</font>

403
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,060
understanding we've seen very poor

404
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,060
reporting coming out of some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

405
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:26,660
penetration tests we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> some tool</font>

406
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,819
blunders of course and a quite a bit of

407
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:34,640
Miss education about findings and about

408
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:36,320
the the underlying issues so and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

409
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,270
of that has to do with just bad

410
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,840
information that's out there some of it

411
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,560
is just

412
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,310
do their research or homework but we'll

413
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,680
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about each of these areas and</font>

414
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,449
hopefully I have examples of each of

415
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,130
these and maybe they'll resonate with

416
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,960
some of you maybe you don't make these

417
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,610
mistakes I'll say first first off I've

418
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,530
made some of these mistakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> um and so</font>

419
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't make</font>

420
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">mistakes and that we shouldn't I'm</font>

421
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,570
saying if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a proper process and</font>

422
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,060
peer review and and things like that

423
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,470
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are backing us up we</font>

424
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,359
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough information and we</font>

425
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,370
should put things in place that is that

426
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,870
ensure quality in our penetration test

427
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,670
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying that people don't</font>

428
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,900
shouldn't mess up and the penetration

429
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,150
testers are perfect and should be

430
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,290
geniuses and all of that I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

431
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,850
trying to say that what I'm trying to

432
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,530
say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to up our game in quality</font>

433
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:26,330
when it comes to these types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tests</font>

434
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:29,569
all right and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these you'll find</font>

435
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,130
I mean some of these are just blatantly

436
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,080
unacceptable you'll see and these are

437
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,640
real all of these come from real real

438
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,680
findings from real assessments so I

439
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,000
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of these up some of them</font>

440
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,130
I had to recreate because I couldn't

441
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,650
give the you know IP addresses or domain

442
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,260
names or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but they're all from</font>

443
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:50,270
from real real reports and real

444
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:52,069
penetration tests so false positives the

445
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,939
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of false</font>

446
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,160
positives coming out of these

447
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,810
assessments that I've been a part of a

448
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,170
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times has to has to do with</font>

449
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,640
incomplete test cases so the the tester

450
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,050
has been taught a single way to do

451
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,450
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only way they</font>

452
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,700
know how to do it perhaps because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

453
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,050
skill gap that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't know how</font>

454
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,910
the thing works so they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been somebody</font>

455
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,829
taught them to to type in this when

456
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,050
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> testing for cross-site scripting</font>

457
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,520
said why don't you go to our snake is

458
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,750
here and talking tomorrow I guess so why

459
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,079
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to our snakes cheat sheet</font>

460
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,180
and type in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if if something bad</font>

461
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,439
happens or you see something weird then

462
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,120
maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an indication of</font>

463
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,410
cross-site scripting and and that's all

464
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,750
they know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

465
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,790
there's a whole lot of other details

466
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,930
that have they go along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with finding</font>

467
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,879
cross-site scripting you know perhaps

468
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,520
there's nothing on the next page you

469
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,930
know when when the reloads there there's

470
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,910
no indication across that scripting but

471
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,960
really the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack was stored</font>

472
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,850
somewhere and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to see it</font>

473
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">later in the application scanners are</font>

474
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,810
not good at finding those sometimes they

475
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,000
find them sometimes they don't but

476
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">humans can can usually realize okay i</font>

477
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">just put</font>

478
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,970
in this whatever name field this gets

479
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,290
stored over here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then later they're</font>

480
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to echo this name field back to</font>

481
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">this page and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to go check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

482
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,830
it's not all that difficult but if

483
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,590
you've never been kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walked through</font>

484
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:08,909
these things then and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

485
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,020
pushing scan on a on a scanner that's by

486
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,990
the way I didn't introduce my friend

487
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,910
here his name is scan monkey and we came

488
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with Skam monkey as a part of this</font>

489
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,380
whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so sometimes</font>

490
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we see penetration testers that</font>

491
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what they're doing and</font>

492
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,429
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hitting scan that was our</font>

493
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,230
affectionate name for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of</font>

494
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:32,430
penetration tester so I apologize it is

495
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:37,890
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of offensive but anyway so scam</font>

496
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:39,930
monkeys my new friend and so anyways

497
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,700
people who just push scan and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

498
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,590
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do any analysis on the findings</font>

499
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,120
I've seen that quite a bit you would

500
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,830
everybody what I think in here would

501
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree that that is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acceptable to hit</font>

502
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,639
scan on a scanner<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then go turn in</font>

503
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that report as your penetration test if</font>

504
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,320
you're doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would really highly</font>

505
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,180
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that so</font>

506
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,649
scanners are often wrong there's lots of

507
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,090
things they missed scanners have lots of

508
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,950
weaknesses they're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better you</font>

509
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:05,100
know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> used scanners in certain</font>

510
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,140
instances we do what we like to call

511
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,820
focus scanning rather than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> turning</font>

512
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,430
the thing loose on a website everybody

513
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,100
knows what happens when you turn IBM or

514
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,890
HP product loose on a website even if

515
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,209
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a test environment you just hope</font>

516
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:23,580
that you've backed it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you hit</font>

517
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:25,200
scan so the other thing is improper test

518
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,300
procedures I have an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

519
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,830
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I won't go too far into that but</font>

520
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,480
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we don't really</font>

521
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand this finding but you know we</font>

522
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,890
kind of know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you do this</font>

523
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,720
sometimes bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> things happen or whatever</font>

524
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,250
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have consistent way to</font>

525
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,930
test something they've never you know

526
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,790
they've never really researched what the

527
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,080
what the finding is they see it in the

528
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,389
scanner and they're like oh yeah that's

529
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,949
that's probably true and they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

530
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it into the report so oh and don't</font>

531
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,440
forget about false negatives thank you

532
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:58,200
scan monkey yeah so that's that's the

533
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">other big thing is I can there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

534
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to see findings in a report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

535
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,400
then go through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say this is not</font>

536
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">right i know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

537
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,190
I can I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> validate this and go retest</font>

538
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,530
this but what about the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

539
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,660
wasn't seen what about all the stuff

540
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,600
they missed because of these same these

541
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,490
same types of mistakes so that's that's

542
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,780
one that it's hard to judge you know how

543
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,810
many false negatives were there in these

544
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,800
in these assessments but it's also

545
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,350
something that kind of worries me

546
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,149
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there could be a whole</font>

547
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,770
bunch of stuff that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been missed for</font>

548
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,480
these same reasons if you've got if

549
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,920
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this many false positives you</font>

550
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,780
know you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem with false</font>

551
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,250
negatives so in this example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font>

552
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my favorite examples I actually love</font>

553
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tell this story because it was a win</font>

554
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,400
for me we had this oppressive

555
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party audit team come in and they</font>

556
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">were you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know trying to destroy all of</font>

557
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,000
our websites we had we had tested these

558
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,340
websites before so my team also does

559
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,690
what we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre honest and so if you</font>

560
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,389
know you're getting audited<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can call</font>

561
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,250
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and we will do a pre audit for you</font>

562
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you clean up stuff and fix</font>

563
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,210
stuff it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an it's it's a necessary</font>

564
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,290
evil I guess when you know you're going

565
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,930
to be audit you don't want to look bad

566
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,030
to the customer and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a pre</font>

567
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,550
audit and we tested this site

568
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,670
extensively this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an example</font>

569
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:18,419
again but this based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real finding</font>

570
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:20,280
and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure that we had</font>

571
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:24,600
caught all of these types of problems

572
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,580
cross-site request forgery and we had

573
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,740
thoroughly tested it we had them fix him

574
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,899
some sea surf problems and and they had

575
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,700
done a pretty good job of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when</font>

576
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,160
this finding came up in the in the

577
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,350
actual audit I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised and</font>

578
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know my heart kind of sank for a</font>

579
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,990
minute cuz you don't like to be the team

580
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,129
that came in first and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

581
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,710
else found something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

582
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,210
find right and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens and I always</font>

583
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,920
equate penetration testing to kind of

584
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,300
like home inspection where if you hire

585
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,920
to home inspectors you're not going to

586
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,350
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same set of findings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing</font>

587
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,520
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar if you hire two</font>

588
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,780
different pen testers you're probably

589
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,730
not going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same set of finding</font>

590
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,480
so that does happen but you don't like

591
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,620
to be the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that missed something so I</font>

592
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,060
expected this a little bit closer I

593
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,820
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can read that from</font>

594
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,040
there so blow it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

595
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,800
expected the URL a little bit closer and

596
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,320
what did I see in there oh that looks to

597
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,590
me like a sea surf taken

598
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,480
okay so they wrote up see surf but in

599
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,610
the screenshot an example they gave they

600
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,720
actually put the sea sir token in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

601
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:28,408
attack so I ran this attack again and

602
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,120
again and I realize way to this doesn't

603
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,830
work you can remove the token and it

604
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,840
does you don't get cross-site request

605
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,509
for it or you know that the request

606
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,850
doesn't go through you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> modify the</font>

607
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:40,259
token and it catches it validates the

608
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,389
token and the request doesn't go through

609
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,960
so it's like how in the world is this

610
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:48,059
see surf and so we called them up and we

611
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,250
actually what I did first because i was

612
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,379
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> peep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a really</font>

613
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:55,230
humiliating video that was like step by

614
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:57,719
step how to tests Percy serve I really

615
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,909
did this I made a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I sent it to</font>

616
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,230
the testers and I was like just so that

617
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,590
they understand the way that seasick

618
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,899
works and it was like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put the</font>

619
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:09,750
token in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack of course the attack</font>

620
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:11,729
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work the token is supposed</font>

621
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,940
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end um piece that you don't</font>

622
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,139
have so many ways they said well no no I

623
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,519
know this happened there was you

624
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:19,740
something about if we were if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

625
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,240
completely remove it or wait let me go

626
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,559
retest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be back in 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes so</font>

627
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,480
tell me was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun with</font>

628
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,178
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> call you back in 10 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

629
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">waited 10 minutes 15 minutes went by I</font>

630
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,649
got an email that said still testing

631
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,269
about an hour and a half later we

632
00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,080
finally got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone call and they were</font>

633
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:39,450
like yeah we can't repeat this finding

634
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,830
and I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's I pretty much</font>

635
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:43,230
knew I could see their screenshot I knew

636
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what they had done and so many</font>

637
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways this it was a case where just a</font>

638
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,659
really blatant false positive improper

639
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,190
testing procedures they didn't

640
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,269
understand I think they thought they

641
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,769
might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the Caesar</font>

642
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,600
token down in the payload and not up in

643
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:56,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL something like that should the</font>

644
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,899
teach at the token be in the RL probably

645
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,570
not but they were typing this in

646
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:04,320
manually so they were passing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the token</font>

647
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:06,000
via the URL so i don't think the website

648
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">was actually generating that URL i think</font>

649
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,789
it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests are doing that but</font>

650
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a win for me and I was</font>

651
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:20,580
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they had to admit they were</font>

652
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:22,279
wrong um<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so another thing about</font>

653
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,710
false positives

654
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:26,299
are these types of issues is a lack of

655
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,409
understanding learning a testing

656
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,299
technique without understanding the

657
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:30,440
vulnerability so I can teach penetration

658
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,759
testing I say this all the time I can

659
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,499
teach penetration testing to almost

660
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,719
anyone who knows how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

661
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:38,899
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to arsenic site and</font>

662
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:42,859
copy those xss chichi things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell</font>

663
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:44,809
you to type<font color="#CCCCCC"> tick or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one equals one in a</font>

664
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:46,609
browser and see if something bad happens

665
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:48,950
and say that that's how you test for

666
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:50,928
sequel injection but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

667
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's that's not responsible that's</font>

668
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,179
not the way I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be teaching</font>

669
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,489
security it's not the way it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

670
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:57,739
teaching penetration testing either I

671
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">can teach you how to turn on a tool and</font>

672
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:01,549
type in the correct URL and get it to

673
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,899
spider and then get it to scan and all

674
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:04,999
that stuff I can teach all of those

675
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,168
things very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not</font>

676
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:09,619
mean that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're doing</font>

677
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:12,169
when you do a penetration test so I find

678
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:14,330
that a lot of testers they give us

679
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,289
findings that have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> that show a blatant</font>

680
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,119
lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding for the</font>

681
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,710
limitations of the scanner so they just

682
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't understand that the scanner is not</font>

683
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,429
good at finding these types of things i

684
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,499
have another see Sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example I think</font>

685
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">later in the presentation that comes</font>

686
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:27,859
from a scanner and you'll see why

687
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:30,258
scanners are not great at testing see

688
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:33,109
surf they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this one</font>

689
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were using was and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even tells</font>

690
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:36,228
you you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some analysis you</font>

691
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,759
need to go inspect this and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

692
00:25:36,229 --> 00:25:41,809
a if it's true<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

693
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,419
just not understanding the underlying

694
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,070
technology how many testers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

695
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,450
sometimes we have to do this actually

696
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,799
often we have to do this right where

697
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,479
we're testing a technology that we've

698
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,330
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I mean has anybody</font>

699
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:55,609
else been there<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I've done it</font>

700
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:58,249
like SI p they asked me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do an essay p</font>

701
00:25:55,609 --> 00:26:00,769
test and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font>

702
00:25:58,249 --> 00:26:02,419
seen SI p so what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went and</font>

703
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,879
did some homework i watched a couple

704
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:07,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">classes by that guy that teaches at</font>

705
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:09,649
black hat forgot his name anyways one of

706
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,179
the one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> foremost experts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on SI p</font>

707
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:13,129

anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could find on the internet</font>

709
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:18,139
from that guy watch some presentations

710
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,450
read up on it right up on just SI p how

711

does SI p work what is it what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

712
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,539
used for what are the technologies

713
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,309
involved and once you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done enough</font>

714
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:26,570
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of technologies you</font>

715
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,859
start to equate things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

716
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,718
something like this before I've worked

717
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:31,399
with IBM products or I've worked with

718
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:33,019
these other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems that are</font>

719
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,699
similar you start to understand do you

720
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:35,380
understand

721
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,730
really deeply know sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

722
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,980
do a test on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't quite</font>

723
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,500
understand as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as you would like so</font>

724
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,519
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> dissing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just</font>

725
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way it turns out sometimes but I</font>

726
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,250
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times they're doing</font>

727
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,820
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle of a test they have no</font>

728
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,080
idea what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and like web</font>

729
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,240
services or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that I had</font>

730
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,730
some testers testing web services this

731
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what this example is about they were</font>

732
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,600
testing a web service I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

733
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,919
soap and they kept telling me the

734
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,689
password is not working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I already</font>

735
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,840
tested this website and I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

736
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,779
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pretty good shape or this web</font>

737
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,000
service anyway so they were like the

738
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:14,860
password is not working well first they

739
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,450
they asked me how do I make requests

740
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,789
that was my first indication how do I

741
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,990
make requests to this web service and I

742
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:23,980
was like well<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the wisdom</font>

743
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,539
what's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whistle okay so I had him go to</font>

744
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,580
the Wizzle and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is</font>

745
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,559
this is the XML that defines this web

746
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,110
service you need to create a request it

747
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,760
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we do have an example ok</font>

748
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,139
that's the shortcut do you have an

749
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">example they always ask for an example</font>

750
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:37,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they do they just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

751
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples so they can mess with it a</font>

752
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,469
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit I'm like no unfortunately we</font>

753
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,880
don't have any example request you're

754
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,279
just going to have to generate a request

755
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,870
on your own like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website pretty much</font>

756
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,320
tells you when you do it wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so</font>

757
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:52,299
you you try to put the the all the

758
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,918
different parameters in there and if one

759
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:55,059
is wrong it usually a lot of times we'll

760
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,580
come back and tell you this parameters

761
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,928
not correct many ways it was telling

762
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the password was not correct and he</font>

763
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,830
didn't understand what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

764
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,179
I've said well I already knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

765
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,299
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of being a</font>

766
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">little cheeky but I was like well are</font>

767
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you sure that all those characters are</font>

768
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,980
valid for for soap request and he's got

769
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,600
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of no and so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said what about</font>

770
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that first character saying that's part</font>

771
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,939
of the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might need to</font>

772
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:24,720
encode that character and he was like

773
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,399
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm encoding characters and he goes</font>

774
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,580
or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> my next time oh yeah it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

775
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:32,199
that puts %<font color="#E5E5E5"> 26 to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vell baba Baba sorry</font>

776
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,949
he did some<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding he replaced it and</font>

777
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,419
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like um yeah you're gonna need a</font>

778
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">different type of encoding that's not</font>

779
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:45,350
going to work in in in this soap message

780
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:50,030
it so he he was like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I got</font>

781
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:52,070
and the tax last 38 in there and I said

782
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,480
try again and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

783
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,129
to do I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> told him that as like you</font>

784
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,679
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do HTTP encoding and he goes</font>

785
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,179
HTTP and coding<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and he doesn't get</font>

786
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,890
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he starts to google it and I'm</font>

787
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:03,830
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay literally type these</font>

788
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:05,150
characters ampersand<font color="#E5E5E5"> am p semicolon but</font>

789
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,949
when that told me is the guy really had

790
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,990
never done a test on a website on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web</font>

791
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,030
service before he'd never issued soap

792
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">requests like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this he was he had me</font>

793
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,418
drawn the board how web services work

794
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,730
and how this specific web service work

795
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,650
and he's the guy responsible for finding

796
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,419
flaws in this thing but he still it

797
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:27,039
doesn't even understand the basics of

798
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:30,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just an example</font>

799
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,640
poor reporting I think everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

800
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,470
relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reporting is hard and</font>

801
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,600
reporting is not fun typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

802
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:38,720
people like it but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> struggle</font>

803
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,280
with reporting as well but there's some

804
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,809
big mistakes that we should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> make and</font>

805
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,480
I've already mentioned copy and pasting

806
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:48,710
from scanner output you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

807
00:29:44,480 --> 00:30:01,610
doing poor organ going in it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

808
00:29:48,710 --> 00:30:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand hell yeah all right 12 all</font>

809
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:06,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">right for organization of findings that</font>

810
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,390
we find that all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time so we got</font>

811
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,740
handed from from some of the Assessors

812
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this happens often</font>

813
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,340
with these with these audits and

814
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,630
assessments that they come in a lot of

815
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,090
times are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for even</font>

816
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,280
producing like any any quality report at

817
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,809
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're their responsibilities to</font>

818
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,950
generate these poems or generate these

819
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,510
findings and go put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in their</font>

820
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,570
back-end system so that they can track

821
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:28,820
them but the way they give them to you

822
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:33,770
we've gotten we've gotten straight out

823
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,720
just scans so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um apps can or web inspect</font>

824
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,400
just straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here's the here's what</font>

825
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,640
the scanner told us go fix all this

826
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,620
stuff we've gotten spreadsheets Excel

827
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,159
spreadsheets that just have some columns

828
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,110
in them no reproduction steps half the

829
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,429
time we don't know exactly where the

830
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,408
finding was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website because we</font>

831
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,010
were given just a part of a URL or maybe

832
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:54,050
the main you

833
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,650
RL and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling us to go look for</font>

834
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:59,419
cross-site scripting so and then then

835
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,670
they'll say oh no no but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

836
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,260
an associated word document that we put

837
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">some screenshots in good luck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finding</font>

838
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> word document because who knows</font>

839
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,820
what it's named sometimes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would put</font>

840
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,860
the correct name in there they would

841
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,659
hand us folders full of stuff just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Excel</font>

842
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,270
spreadsheets and screenshots and and

843
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,740
scans and stuff so it was almost

844
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:19,160
impossible we had to go through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

845
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,080
you know reanalyze and reorganize all of

846
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,720
the findings<font color="#CCCCCC"> and customers should not</font>

847
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,389
have to do that it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious it</font>

848
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,450
should be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear I think everything</font>

849
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be in a single package or bundle</font>

850
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you do includes it's okay to</font>

851
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,350
include scan reports but as like

852
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,660
appendices or something like that as

853
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:40,129
supplementary they shouldn't really have

854
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,390
to go if they need some really low level

855
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,160
detail what's going on maybe they go to

856
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,940
the scan for that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what they</font>

857
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,470
need should be in your main report no

858
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,990
reproduction steps is a huge one or

859
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:52,520
wrong reproduction steps or reproduction

860
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,370
steps that are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to the way</font>

861
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,810
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did it and not you know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

862
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,629
you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and do it there's a whole</font>

863
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:01,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of variation of oh well you had to</font>

864
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,260
do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before you could do</font>

865
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,149
this part of the reproduction and none

866
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that was in there so a lot of times</font>

867
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,570
my team would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go reanalyze these</font>

868
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,490
findings refigure out exactly how they

869
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:14,210
exploited them spend all of that much

870
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,020
time trying to figure out what this

871
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:21,050
tester did<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to get to this finding</font>

872
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,100
missing or poor screenshots we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found so</font>

873
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,990
many times where they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong</font>

874
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">screenshot right I don't know if anybody</font>

875
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,380
else's I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that before but we</font>

876
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,560
usually catch it in there in the review

877
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:35,060
but just completely wrong screenshot

878
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:39,139
with with some finding in this case so

879
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:41,690
this was a bad report the finding title

880
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,020
in the report was insecure DB update log

881
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,400
injection okay that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

882
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">really even know what that is by reading</font>

883
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,950
an insecure DB update log injection I

884
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:55,490
know what log injection is insecure DB

885
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:57,410
update maybe but when I actually read

886
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,820
this finding the actual finding was

887
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,650
improper access control this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

888
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,840
website that was not doing proper access

889
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,520
control that's that's all it was so you

890
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,300
could you could issue some requests and

891
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,470
the website would<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor the request but</font>

892
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,810
shouldn't because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access</font>

893
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not authorized to do that</font>

894
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:14,399
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the the title didn't even match</font>

895
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,290
the actual finding and then here's what

896
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,420
the remediation said ensure that a user

897
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,610
does in fact have access rights to

898
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,770
change a database row before allowing

899
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:26,340
the user to change it we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

900
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,290
web application here so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

901
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,030
what they're talking about access rights

902
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,399
to change databases so when I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

903
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:34,560
talked to this guy he actually didn't

904
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,450
even understand the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a website</font>

905
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,669
interacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the database typically so</font>

906
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,290
a typical architecture is that the

907
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">website logs into the database right</font>

908
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,580
with its own account and the web the web

909
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,340
application has pretty much full rights

910
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,710
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data in the database and he's at</font>

911
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,340
that application acts on behalf of a

912
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:55,260
user and so users don't have database

913
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,419
accounts and you don't typically check

914
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,280
to see if they have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things two</font>

915
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,350
rows and columns and stuff like that in

916
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,879
the database so he was suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

917
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,709
some sort of database access control

918
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,300
when this thing was really a web

919
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,340
application in what he should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

920
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing is web application access control</font>

921
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,320
or role based authentication or

922
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,750
something but his remediation I mean

923
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,240
this was just a crazy finding that made

924
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,380
absolutely no sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

925
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,270
ever used this guy again for a

926
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:26,700
penetration test another<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding that I</font>

927
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,219
found recently is a cross-site scripting

928
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,089
injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> as anybody ever seen a finding</font>

929
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:32,939
called this cross-site scripting

930
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,980
injection because I I scraped the

931
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet I kept asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all my friends</font>

932
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,219
does anybody know what cross-site

933
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:43,260
scripting injection is nobody did if

934
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:45,120
nobody knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that finding is and if</font>

935
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,950
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not some you know if you can't go</font>

936
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the cwe or somewhere and find the</font>

937
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:52,080
name of your finding in there it might

938
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,100
not be a real funding but so they were

939
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,870
calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing cross-site scripting</font>

940
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,429
injection and they really did put the

941
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,690
injection on for a reason it wasn't just

942
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they didn't know the name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

943
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">cross sucks card with the name of that</font>

944
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,710
finding it's because they were trying to

945
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">say it was something a little bit</font>

946
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,490
different than cross-site scripting

947
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,080
because I knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the in the</font>

948
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,720
finding itself it said admins and web

949
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,900
designers can use this to inject scripts

950
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,319
onto a page and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like okay what are</font>

951
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">we testing here and then I go further</font>

952
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,620
read down in their report and they wrote

953
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,900
this I

954
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,440
right this the page is intended to let

955
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,060
designers edit HTML pages and scripts

956
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,740
then I'm like okay what prod look at the

957
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:32,870
product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a finding against</font>

958
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:34,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">SharePoint sharepoint designer and lo</font>

959
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,380
and behold if you were an admin or a web

960
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:41,060
designer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> SharePoint you can inject</font>

961
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:42,320
scripts onto a page so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to go back</font>

962
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say yeah I think that's kind of the</font>

963
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,730
intent of this feature and not sure that

964
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:54,890
this was a real finding all right moving

965
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:56,270
on to tool we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move fast</font>

966
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,310
because I need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> past this to the</font>

967
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,380
some of the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyways tool</font>

968
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,450
blunders attack of the scan monkeys

969
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,710
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> hitting scan and they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

970
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the scanner does and they're</font>

971
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,370
tearing up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> website's tearing up</font>

972
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,810
your databases causing we've actually

973
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:11,450
done this before<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to admit it</font>

974
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were scanning a website and in</font>

975
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,169
the comment field we scanned the comment

976
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:17,300
field and the comment field sends real

977
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,790
emails to real people when you do that

978
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,900
and so we had all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calls to the</font>

979
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,330
help desk<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I'm getting weird</font>

980
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,460
emails that have things like bracket

981
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,529
script bracket alert blah blah blah in

982
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,150
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was not good you have</font>

983
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,680
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what parts you should be</font>

984
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,260
scanning even in a test environment this

985
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,569
thing was sending real emails so anyways

986
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,760
it's happened no<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a vetting process</font>

987
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to we've had all kinds of</font>

988
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,720
crashes and things like that happen on

989
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:45,460
systems where they brought up some tool

990
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,200
like some old version of FG downpour or

991
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,180
pw dump or something like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

992
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,680
send else has classic crashes and you

993
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,100
know what happens when else has crashes

994
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,080
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows machine you get be sod so</font>

995
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is on a black production server</font>

996
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,190
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that so it's</font>

997
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,080
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guy just picked up a tool</font>

998
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,940
that he's like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do I'm pass</font>

999
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,529
the hash again<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or ha what was the</font>

1000
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,910
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they just go google it</font>

1001
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,130
and they go download whatever they the

1002
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,140
first tool they see and they run that

1003
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,280
tool and then that tool crashes so it's

1004
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,690
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have 20 vetting</font>

1005
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,070
processes and that we're not using

1006
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,870
arbitrary tools do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1007
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,000
creative and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be adaptive and</font>

1008
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,770
all that stuff yes but at the same time

1009
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,060
we can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go pulling tools off the</font>

1010
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,610
internet and just running them because

1011
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,900
or even I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> scan monkey has</font>

1012
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,150
something to say about this but it came

1013
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,250
with backtrack I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that one</font>

1014
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:34,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">before it should be ok to use right</font>

1015
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,280
so anyways relying on scanners only

1016
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,350
obviously no analysis of the scan

1017
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,710
findings we've already talked about that

1018
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move a little bit quicker</font>

1019
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,280
here's one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font>

1020
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,320
surf scanners are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not great at finding</font>

1021
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,610
see surf here's what the scanner said

1022
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,230
the test result seems to indicate a

1023
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,940
vulnerability because the same request

1024
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:56,130
was sent twice in different sessions and

1025
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,770
the same response was received<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1026
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,940
that's how the scanner thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> its Caesar</font>

1027
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:02,160
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the response is what</font>

1028
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,690
you get you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> encountered an invalid</font>

1029
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,520
user or you've either entered invalid

1030
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,870
username or password or your account<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

1031
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,100
been locked the scanner had locked

1032
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,569
itself out and so it was calling

1033
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,880
everything see surf because everything

1034
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:15,540
was returning the same request or the

1035
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,830
same response another example I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1036
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,180
going to let you guys analyze this for a

1037
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,220
second but since we're a little short on

1038
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,279
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just tell you what's about to</font>

1039
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,589
happen this guy was manually testing in

1040
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bert and he had done some cross-site</font>

1041
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,700
scripting that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually successful</font>

1042
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,080
up in the request and then he clicked on

1043
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that request right clicked on that same</font>

1044
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,920
request and did do an active scan if you

1045
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,510
do an active scan with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request that</font>

1046
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,460
already has cross-site scripting attacks

1047
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,580
in it you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something like</font>

1048
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:47,490
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's exactly what happened I</font>

1049
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:50,480
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that one was funny that was</font>

1050
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:54,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually somebody from my team um</font>

1051
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,710
relying on scanners<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested a product</font>

1052
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,609
that they told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me had been tested 12</font>

1053
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,770
times this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually a pretty good</font>

1054
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,690
product from overseas Australian written

1055
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:02,310
software it actually was really a look

1056
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,490
to be a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of software</font>

1057
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:08,040
and I'd been tested a bunch it was cold

1058
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,319
fusion and within literally within about

1059
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,490
an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found that they had</font>

1060
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,660
absolutely no access control on the

1061
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,430
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they were not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were using</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the Mach 2 framework and in coldfusion</font>

1063
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,240
but they were not using the access

1064
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:20,339
control piece of that framework and so

1065
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,959
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you knew any of the URLs any of the</font>

1068
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,700
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys that had 12 penetration tests</font>

1069
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,130
they showed me from government

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations and stuff like that so</font>

1071
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:32,520
that was really alarming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I and they</font>

1072
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,870
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not believe that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this was a real</font>

penetration<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests and nobody found that</font>

1075
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,779
they had absolutely no access control in

1076
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this application it was because they</font>

1077
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,140
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a scanner and scanners are</font>

1078
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,240
not good at

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,328
access control violation or access

1080
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,240
control testing they can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

1081
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:52,519
they're not great at it miss education i

1082
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,279
wanted to harp on since we're here a

1083
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:58,490
wasp just a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> summit i'm just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go straight to this one so you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">might be played with I goat before</font>

1086
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,299
time's running out anyways if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever</font>

1087
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:08,180
played with I go there's some there's

1088
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:10,009
some bad bad suggested solutions in

1089
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,299
there this one's got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or its</font>

1090
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,569
passing the username and password on the

1092
00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:19,759
one they're passing a secret key to a

1094
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,660
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggested solution so sorry</font>

1095
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,558
Oh else we can do better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1096
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,269
quality assurance what can we learn from

1097
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:32,299
QA I'm going to have to buzz through

1098
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:33,680
this but it's not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the</font>

1099
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,880
creativity out of penetration testing

1100
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,078
first time somebody ever told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me we</font>

1101
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,059
needed QA and they were like you know

1102
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,289
you guys have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be subject to you QA we</font>

1103
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,760
have to review your reports and stuff I

1104
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:44,180
got mad about that or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever but I</font>

1105
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,759
realized now folly of my ways quality

1106
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,009
reduces costs in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1107
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:50,660
testers and to the customer it's

1108
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:53,180
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concentrate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1109
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,319
when i looked up<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality assurance just</font>

1110
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,419
straight from<font color="#E5E5E5"> wikipedia here's two</font>

1111
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,400
things i found fit for purpose and right

1112
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,900
the first time and we really need to

1113
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about that does penetration</font>

1114
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,230
testing fit this purpose are we doing

1115
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:05,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing should we be doing</font>

1116
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else architecture assessment</font>

1118
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:11,089
know what penetration is good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1119
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:12,890
what it's not good at finding and are we

1120
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:15,680
doing it right the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

1121
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">those were good lessons zero knowledge</font>

1122
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,098
if you're if you're doing a lot of zero

1123
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:21,769
knowledge i would really think twice

1124
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is a paid gig not a CTF</font>

1125
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:26,240
competition the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find flaws</font>

1126
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,980
not to prove how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Li you are black box</font>

1127
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,680
tests are I'm not saying don't do black

1128
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:33,890
buck tests ever but they are they serve

1129
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,269
a different purpose then most of what

1130
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,710
most customers want from a penetration

1131
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,549
test they want you to find flaws they

1132
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,980
want to know what's wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their</font>

1133
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:41,150
systems sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want you to test</font>

1134
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,339
their security mechanisms and the

1135
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,259
response and you should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

1136
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:46,578
that's a different it's a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

1137
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:48,829
of penetration testing you need to know

1138
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:52,250
which one they want and which one you

1139
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:53,560
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing so collaborative I</font>

1140
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:57,970
think is the way to go in most case

1141
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,410
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um security testing there's I'm going</font>

1142
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,649
to actually breeze through this one it's

1143
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that important pentesting is QA so</font>

1144
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,220
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to argue that pen testing</font>

1145
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,140
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q and so we do we really have to do</font>

1146
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,730
QA on pen testing what we do we're

1147
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,890
selling it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a product and we're using</font>

1148
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,560
it to sell products so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> subjective</font>

1149
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:17,140
quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a black art right i</font>

1150
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it's its artistic we can't we can't</font>

1151
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">put QA on an art but yeah the same way</font>

1152
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,660
that we know the difference between

1153
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:26,620
quality art and poor quality art we we

1154
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,940
know the difference between a poor

1155
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:33,759
penetration test and a good one you know

1156
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,500
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> for going so fast our team</font>

1157
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,530
started doing these things actually so

1158
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,000
ISO 9000 9001 procedures controlling

1159
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">your documents controlling your records</font>

1160
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,930
and procedures doing internal audits on

1161
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,670
your procedure process for doing

1162
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:52,990
penetration testing on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen testing</font>

1163
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:56,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">mech mechanisms and processes a dealing</font>

1164
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,299
with non-conformance the how<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1165
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,090
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the corrective action the</font>

1166
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,010
what so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it wrong and what are we</font>

1167
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do to fix it and preventive</font>

1168
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,450
actions so we've actually instilled

1169
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,520
these now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our process and are trying</font>

1170
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:12,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know better our team and better</font>

1171
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,120
ourselves by using just standard quality

1172
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:18,490
assurance techniques ken tools help I

1173
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,720
think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can so there's tools out</font>

1174
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,069
there that some people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not</font>

1175
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,319
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit for the purpose as much</font>

1176
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:27,550
collaboration tools maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> SharePoint</font>

1177
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:30,400
things like that but we have actually

1178
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:32,770
found a few tools thread<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixes one is</font>

1179
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,080
anybody from<font color="#E5E5E5"> denim in here no anyways</font>

1180
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,370
denim has a tool their tool is

1181
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,049
specifically for web application

1182
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:41,589
findings mostly from like scanner type

1183
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:43,360
stuff but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the best parts of tools</font>

1184
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">anywhere these types of tools is</font>

1185
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,530
automated report generation if you can

1186
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,940
document your findings as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

1187
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:51,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">then hit a button and it spits out a</font>

1188
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:54,850
really pretty really consistent

1189
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,680
comprehensive detailed report that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1190
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:59,860
awesome then not everybody has to be

1191
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,259
Ward<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wizards we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually wrote our own</font>

1192
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,700
tool to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we call it RTS we're</font>

1193
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,700
actually writing a new version now

1194
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,770
sams and you basically define

1195
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,169
assessments and metadata along with

1196
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,509
those assessments and then you define

1197
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,250
the test cases the targets and the and

1198
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,630
we have a bank of findings that we use

1199
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,000
you can always create new findings if

1200
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,640
there's something specific you can add

1201
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,050
screenshots you can add custom notes you

1202
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,910
put all of this in the tool you can see

1203
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,440
who's currently testing what phase there

1204
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,690
in how much they've tested what

1205
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,170
percentage of completion they are on

1206
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">this on this penetration test all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1207
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,349
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff associate findings</font>

1208
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,509
with targets so this finding came from

1209
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:39,520
this target that kind of stuff it's an

1210
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,560
awesome system that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for</font>

1211
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,849
four years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really helps us</font>

1212
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,210
to keep track of what's going on and to

1213
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:47,950
get a better quality pin test in the end

1214
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:50,079
and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wanted to kind of</font>

1215
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,790
mention is I'm working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us now to</font>

1216
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,460
develop a project similar that we can

1217
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,990
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the community so we can't</font>

1218
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,480
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the code unfortunately for the</font>

1219
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:00,009
one that we built but we can donate you

1220
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,020
know our brains and and some of the

1221
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,589
design features and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1222
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm working with us now to build a</font>

1223
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:09,520
project to build a security assessment

1224
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,960
tool like this so that people can

1225
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,560
hopefully have instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some new</font>

1226
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,849
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does hacking or that some some</font>

1227
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,920
kind of new exploit tool or whatever

1228
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:19,810
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool basically to help help us</font>

1229
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,390
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow and help us do a better</font>

1230
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:25,240
quality job so that's what I'm working

1231
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:30,150
on this my goal for this next this next

1232
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,149
year so sorry I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

1233
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,370
you
