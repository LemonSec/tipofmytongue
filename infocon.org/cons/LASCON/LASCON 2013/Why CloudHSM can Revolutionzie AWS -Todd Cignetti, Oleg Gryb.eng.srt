00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,409
I'm a security architect into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly an application security domain</font>

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,920
but sometimes I in crossing the line by

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into different areas like</font>

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,270
infrastructure networking security and

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,890
Incident Response mostly to analyze root

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,020
causes and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,400
reliable security architecture patterns

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,850
to prevent it from happening in the

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,670
future i'm also very passionate about

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:46,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">security appliances my first experience</font>

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,350
these devices like that goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 10</font>

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,750
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was working on a credit</font>

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,870
card processing solution for a credit

00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">card company and it was in cyber at that</font>

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,209
time then when i joined Washington usual

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,150
the where billion seriously indeed

18
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,409
architecture and I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to put</font>

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,600
security control<font color="#E5E5E5"> around it to protect</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">XML traffic using forum system devices</font>

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,179
then when I join into it in 2007 there

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,539
was yet another interesting project can

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,670
build in si si to connect to big

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,500
insurance medical insurance company at

25
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that time i was using data power and</font>

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,940
again trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect SOA architecture</font>

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:31,009
and xml traffic and lastly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:35,590
involved with ingredient related

29
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:38,510
projects to encrypt sensitive data and

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,620
the last project was related to cloud

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,630
HSN and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like it a lot and what i like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you can play with all those expensive</font>

34
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:55,670
and interesting choice for free and

35
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:58,580
getting paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> well at this is great so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,458
even further so those were previous

let me talk briefly about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome on</font>

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,709
mindset<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mentality i would say when</font>

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,829
it comes to cloud not not to pick talk

65
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,170
with you but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to the cloud I think</font>

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,450
like everybody has agreed lately does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

67
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,208
in general any cloud platforms that I'm

68
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,890
aware of like Rackspace every director

69
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,540
from VMware AWS is a great tool to

70
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,298
enable fast application development it's

71
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,890
very flexible it allows the built like

72
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:45,549
really scalable and highly available

73
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,890
solutions if you do it right you don't

74
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to wait until hardware's provision</font>

75
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">tenancy told you just write the script</font>

76
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,510
to run it in AWS environment and you

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,578
have everything up in rank it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

78
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,010
mobile official when you think about

79
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,609
cyclic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on applications like TurboTax for</font>

80
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,730
example which has a mini peak in January

81
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,260
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korean beef eek spike in volumes in</font>

82
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,780
April and everything after that

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,310
everything becomes very much flat but we

84
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,769
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to maintain all this</font>

85
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,789
expensive hardware infrastructure and so

86
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:22,300
on so AWS or any has a cloud environment

87
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:24,849
is a very good fit for this kind of

88
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,370
scenarios but when it comes to security

89
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and privacy and suddenly the picture</font>

90
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,800
becomes not so rosy are not so great and

91
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that is explained briefly</font>

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,470
on this slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can rephrase it a</font>

93
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,320
little bit what I people<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

94
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,280
concerned about and it's very serious

95
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually sometimes</font>

96
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,479
culminating statements that I've seen I

97
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">have heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from executive for way in</font>

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,710
charge of making decision about moving a

99
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,900
not moving to a cloud very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very saying</font>

100
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,750
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> liz's I do not want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose my</font>

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">job because of those issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the first</font>

102
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,600
things that we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider that we</font>

103
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really know what kind of security</font>

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,830
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy policies are implemented by</font>

105
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,070
cloud provider they are not publicized

106
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,780
anyway we don't know the second one we

107
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really know who has access to our</font>

108
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,580
sensitive data<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kansas sensitive data the</font>

109
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,110
corporate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop and then exposed</font>

110
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,650
somewhere intentionally or

111
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,400
unintentionally there is no any kind of

112
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,900
usually there is no any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of legal</font>

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,120
agreement that I would explain what will

114
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,120
happen if there is a security security

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,730
breach or you say like can support any

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:39,230
kind of SLA it's not common for

117
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,420
scenarios when somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a</font>

118
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,720
cloud and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I like people I</font>

119
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,310
can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell their last but not the</font>

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,100
least and the least is key management

121
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,750
and there was like a great great

122
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,090
discussion yesterday in the speed

123
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,220
discussion about transparent data

124
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,159
encryption or chi è<font color="#CCCCCC"> é as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle calls</font>

125
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,940
it and if it has value or doesn't have a

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,670
value in my view it is the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TD</font>

127
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,310
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero it's was at zero and I</font>

128
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,770
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> would use ttee for less</font>

129
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,800
sensitive data what less sensitive data

130
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,599
means depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your use case depends</font>

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,440
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business I know what less</font>

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,330
sensitive data means for small business

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,390
for example I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider less</font>

134
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,460
sensitive data like customer address and

135
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,219
a phone name this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff i would</font>

136
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:31,430
use TD for that but if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

137
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,070
my serious they<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut data like</font>

138
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">credit-card number social-security</font>

139
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:39,650
numbers keys passphrases passwords

140
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">banking account number this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data</font>

141
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,520
i can say there is like a real secrets

142
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,219
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't recommend TD for this</font>

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,200
kind of stuff again my major concern is

144
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,770
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how the ski management</font>

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,630
works how<font color="#CCCCCC"> its implemented</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a cloud</font>

146
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,719
provider who has access<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

147
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,830
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth and</font>

148
00:06:55,719 --> 00:07:00,229
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to change this</font>

149
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,289
mentality and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

150
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:05,120
obstacles<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by companies with like</font>

151
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,188
real really sensitive data like big

152
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,620
financial institutions are not going to

153
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,710
cloud yet because of that it's my

154
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,639
opinion so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can change the</font>

155
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,529
mentality somehow at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

156
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,139
by implementing a very sound data

157
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,029
protection mechanism where we control

158
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,449
all the ski management process and the

159
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:29,449
keys then I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

160
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:34,909
comfortable to put their sensitive data

161
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:37,849
to a cloud and this is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud reaches</font>

162
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:41,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">em can can help in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this task of</font>

163
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:46,599
protecting data<font color="#E5E5E5"> better the major things</font>

164
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I like about cloud HSN it that</font>

165
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,159
Amazon or any other employee in other

166
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,948
solutions that I've seen this is like a

167
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:58,188
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct space you can implement a</font>

168
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:02,210
solution when cloud provider employees

169
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:05,389
do not have access to your keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

170
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,948
you control the key if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you encrypt your</font>

171
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,849
data using the key that won't leave you

172
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:12,860
again axis then you have a very high

173
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:17,259
level of a student that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

174
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,599
steal your data or expose it somewhere

175
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,849
then there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a number of very</font>

176
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,680
good security controls and what we'll

177
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:27,020
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them and details but i just</font>

178
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,659
want to mention that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have at least</font>

179
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,818
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two level of controls at network</font>

180
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:34,370
level the first one is related to

181
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,110
security groups and security groups are

182
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,110
just simplified representation and

183
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:43,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">traditional firewall that you can use to</font>

184
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:45,649
protect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud HSN then you have</font>

185
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,990
certificates that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> install on</font>

186
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,660
server and client side and then using

187
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,670
certificates to establish a trusted

188
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,939
communication channel between decline

189
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,920
the server and finally at application

190
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,560
level you have three level of

191
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,689
credentials the first one is manager

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,258
credentials which can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

193
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:10,779
to SS to HSN survey or<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH</font>

194
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:13,239
and start doing some kind of management

195
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,429
job like initializing the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

196
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:16,869
when you initialize device you will be

197
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:19,089
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create administrative</font>

198
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:21,399
credentials and this is a second level

199
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:26,709
of credentials which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chew</font>

200
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,539
configuring petitions and importance in

201
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,289
here that you are the one who<font color="#CCCCCC"> created</font>

202
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:35,049
administrative credentials not AWS

203
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,539
people and that's my like if you control

204
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:39,850
administrative credentials it means that

205
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:42,970
nobody else can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to partition</font>

206
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">and petitions are the buckets were all</font>

207
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,919
secrets<font color="#E5E5E5"> as not so the third level of</font>

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,319
protection is<font color="#E5E5E5"> partition level password</font>

209
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,660
or PIN as i call it and this is what you

210
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:56,139
give to an application that requires

211
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,899
access to hsm device to do encryption

212
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:01,629
create new keys and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth so</font>

213
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:05,019
all the speeches I think my club<font color="#CCCCCC"> hsm a</font>

214
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:07,600
perfect tool to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up assurance level</font>

215
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:10,209
when it comes to protecting data in a

216
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,129
cloud environment and with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

217
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:15,008
hand it over to Todd and he will talk

218
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">about detail about in details about all</font>

219
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,949
features which are available acknowledge

220
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:27,209
SM and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will return to my</font>

221
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:27,209
experience thank you

222
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:34,969
so just as a show of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands a get an idea</font>

223
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:38,508
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

224
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depth what it what is in hsm so I can</font>

225
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:42,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half great</font>

226
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,689
that's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> highlight is going to be a</font>

227
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,910
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of review but I want to make</font>

228
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:48,589
sure we hit some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some of the</font>

229
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:52,209
properties of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM are really</font>

230
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:54,350
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud HSM service so</font>

231
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,679
let's back up a little bit and talk

232
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in hsm so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an HSM</font>

233
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,858
is a purpose-built appliance that is

234
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed to protect key material and</font>

235
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:10,160
operate with cryptographic operations

236
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:12,488
securely on that key material it's

237
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,429
fundamentally designed so that if

238
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:19,669
tampering is detected that the HSM will

239
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:22,299
respond and destroy the keys that's the

240
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:28,040
physical layer of protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

241
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:29,660
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design the other part</font>

242
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,839
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design that's critical to the</font>

243
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:36,279
service is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logical separation of</font>

244
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:39,230
roles and what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is there's a</font>

245
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,329
appliance administrator and forgive me

246
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I'm talking primarily about the safe</font>

247
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,449
net<font color="#E5E5E5"> luna SI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM right now there are</font>

248
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:52,249
other h SMS that have different security

249
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:55,008
models different roles but the intention

250
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the same but some of the specifics</font>

251
00:11:55,009 --> 00:12:00,319
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now are specific</font>

252
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,509
to the safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> night h SMS the roles are</font>

253
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:06,199
there's an appliance administrator<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

254
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:13,879
has the ability to set the network

255
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:17,059
configuration control system as a device

256
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,209
in the network and manage it as a normal

257
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,219
server would be managed in the network

258
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,229
the other role though is much more

259
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,959
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's really unique to an</font>

260
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,230
HSM and that's the security officer the

261
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,018
security officer has the ability to

262
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,119
control the use of the cryptographic

263
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,149
keys that are stored on the appliance

264
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:41,630
and one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about this is the</font>

265
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:44,300
appliance is a one rack unit

266
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,490
like a server right that's the that's

267
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,160
what the appliance administrator can

268
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,380
manage within that appliance though

269
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,410
there's a there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pci bus and there's</font>

270
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,200
a secure card on that pci bus that is

271
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,870
the hsm module itself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the</font>

272
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,860
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the cryptographic</font>

273
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,900
operations occur and that's where the

274
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,420
key material is stored and that's what

275
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,819
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security officer controls so there's</font>

276
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,620
really if you think keep that model in

277
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,260
your mind as we talk further that's

278
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,380
really important another important

279
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:21,350
factor in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsm is that it's designed</font>

280
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:24,320
and tested by<font color="#CCCCCC"> safenet to be secure they</font>

281
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:28,940
have secure manufacturing processes they

282
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,320
have secure development facilities and

283
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,990
they do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

284
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,640
secure but the other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do</font>

285
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:40,030
is is they get third party approvals<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

286
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,910
validation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> phipps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Common Criteria</font>

built securely so based on that AWS in

290
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">March of this year released a service</font>

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,290
called cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM AWS cloud HSM is the</font>

292
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:06,500
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the service what the service</font>

293
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:09,589
entails is dedicated access to a luna<font color="#E5E5E5"> sa</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">HSM that means the device is dedicated</font>

295
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:17,210
it's not shared among multiple customers

296
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:21,290
the h SMS are in AWS data centers and

297
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:24,410
the advantage of that is you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

298
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:28,790
same mechanisms to protect and isolate

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:31,969
them within your virtual private network

301

groups to isolate them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and connect them</font>

302
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,950
but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea is that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

303
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,449
connect them to your instances running

304
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:43,130
in in AWS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the latency is minimized</font>

305
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:49,310
because they're located in the same data

306
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:52,460

<font color="#E5E5E5">Northern Virginia and in Dublin Ireland</font>

308
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,120
and what's really fundamental to this

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">service is what I alluded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to earlier in</font>

real estate transactions this is a case

437
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,639
where they're using a public CA issued

438
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,560
an intermediate signing certificate but

439
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,780
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA had the requirement that</font>

440
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,560
that signing certificate always remain

441
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:19,810
in a hardware security module so they

442
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,190
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to meet that requirement and</font>

443
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:26,169
still use AWS with cloud HSM there

444
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,060
there's intermediate signing certificate

445
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,539
is in the cloud HSM and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it</font>

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,639
the security blog at AWS i think is is a

really great source of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about</font>

471
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:46,359
recall some conversation that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

472
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,489
thought I was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

473
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,279
that impressed me the most while I was

474
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:54,460
reading cloudy HSN documentation and it

475
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:57,639
was a warning warning if you lose your

476
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:01,450
admin level credentials there is nasty

477

AWS services can to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cavalier</font>

478
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:06,399
secrets and you started disguisey that

479
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,259
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start imported or we got like</font>

480
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:10,840
reprimanded for that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were</font>

481
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:13,210
saying how come you cannot recover and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

482
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,728
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feature</font>

483
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,789
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the most about your</font>

484
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:21,039
solution it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of point</font>

485
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:26,169
of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what prospective</font>

486
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:28,960
your help so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of privacy</font>

487
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:30,519
onion is a very fast and simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

488
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
would say it's not completely automated

489
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,049
though so the first step that you need

490
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,700
to do you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow some form</font>

491
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:42,279
and after that God's team will provide

492
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,440
managers credentials for you and after

493
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a manager's credentials you</font>

494
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,679
will be able

495
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,830
to connect using ssh to your HSM server

496
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,489
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all you need to still need</font>

497
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:58,029
to do like a few manual steps to make

498
00:23:54,489 --> 00:24:00,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that your cloud each sm can be</font>

499
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:03,879
usable from applications so first of all

500
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,840
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to initialize the appliance and</font>

501
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:11,738
by initializing I mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

502
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,928
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually destroy all secrets if</font>

503
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:19,960
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> any and you would need to</font>

504
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,269
create new admin credentials then you

505
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,399
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hire generate server-side</font>

506
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:26,109
certificates which are used for

507
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:28,478
establishing trusted connection between

508
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:32,249
client and the server then you might

509
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:34,989
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to then you need to restart your</font>

00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:40,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking interfacing using the same</font>

511
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:43,769
kills<font color="#CCCCCC"> NGLs bind command and finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

512
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:47,109
need to login as administrator to the

513
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:49,299
appliance and he'll do some work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

514
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:51,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">configure them here partitions so you</font>

515
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:54,129
basically need to create a partition

516
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,570
then you need to register<font color="#E5E5E5"> a petition to</font>

517
00:24:54,129 --> 00:24:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">a client and this is like yet another</font>

518
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,349
good feature so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually assign</font>

519
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,769
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> two partitions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this way you</font>

520
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:04,928
can separate your clients and you can

521
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:07,960
control which client has access to what

522
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:10,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">secrets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally you need to assign a</font>

523
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,919
petition to a client so it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

524
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:13,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of work and in the end of</font>

525
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,409
this presentation I will show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it</font>

526
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:19,689
can be automated there is like yet

527
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,570
another interesting problems that I

528
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,940
encouraged and that thought helped me

529
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,999
with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> safenet help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geez it was</font>

530
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,320
related to client certificates so as I

531
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,849
mentioned you doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

532
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,859
certificates to establish a trust

533
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:35,109
channel between client of the server and

534
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:37,830
here is a command that would allow you

535
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:40,869
to create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate after</font>

536
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:42,340
certificate is created it needs to be

537
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:46,720
registered public portion of the

538
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:50,019
certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be st.pete to to</font>

539
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,529
the server and registered by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

540
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:56,190
and normally to do that you also need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

541
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:57,970
provide an IP address of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client</font>

542
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">security-wise this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

543
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,870
feature

544
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:04,179
cause your certificate becomes bound to

545
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,770
an IP so if somebody compromises<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

546
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificates still certificates you</font>

547
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,090
won't be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another 80</font>

548
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,310
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> security wise again this is</font>

549
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,199
good but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from usability</font>

550
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,500
point of view and if you start looking

551
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">at her outer scale in groups then you</font>

552
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:22,120
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize that there is no such a</font>

553
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,669
single static IP instances go I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

554
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go up and down IP is changing all the</font>

555
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:30,190
time so simply doesn't work and it was

556
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,219
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> questioned that example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

557
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,900
short and safe night plans but then they

558
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,320
finally confirm that there is a solution

559
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,800
and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using an AP you can</font>

560
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply create a client certificate with</font>

561
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,379
illogical name and you Jesus and this

562
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:50,169
light it's a short name and after this

563
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,080
logical name is created again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in</font>

564
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:57,280
public portion of it to cloud each sm

565
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:00,250
server and registering and this is the

566
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,290
last line of the slide registers

567
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,970
declined by certificate name so it's

568
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,940
confirmed it should work and actually

569
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">tested it it works as expected so there</font>

570
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,470
is a solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> but of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

571
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,850
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> security considerations if you're</font>

572
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,150
doing that then you're compromising

573
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,530
security a little bit because now if

574
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,950
client certificate disco promis-- it can

575
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,770
be used from anywhere but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font>

576
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable compromise because</font>

577
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,270
you can implement as a mitigating

578
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:32,740
controls you probably need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more</font>

579
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,480
scrutiny at network level by carefully

580
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,940
considering what kind of policies you

581
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,480
want to implement some security groups

582
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:43,570
and you of course need to take care

583
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,350
about pins to make sure that they are

584
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,909
strong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're protected well so it</font>

585
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,949
was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> two conditions are met than</font>

586
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise the certificate looks</font>

587
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,130
like a good one yet has a good feature

588
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,020
that I like about Claudia semi didn't

589
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,820
have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems integrating it with</font>

590
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Java client application it's completely</font>

591
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,159
compliant with java cryptography

592
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,200
architecture so in you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

593
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,230
do two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one you need</font>

594
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,350
drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> aluna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provided jar files to clasp</font>

595
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,080
on as a second one you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add one</font>

596
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:23,049
line to your java dot security file and

597
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,720
after that you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard Java API</font>

598
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:27,158
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional cryptography functions</font>

599
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,500
like creating symmetric key encryption

600
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:34,980
data decryption everything is done

601
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:38,409
through traditional Java API yet another

602
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,240
interesting since this on a chair a

603
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:43,059
witch a stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for highly available</font>

604
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,070
array of Lunas and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you need to</font>

605
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

606
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,289
dealing with mission critical

607
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,809
application and you are concerned about

608
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability of this application</font>

609
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:57,760
creation h-hey array is a very simple

610
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">task you basically need to have two or</font>

611
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,750
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices which are configured</font>

612
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,449
absolutely in the same way and after

613
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:07,330
this is done you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vtl</font>

614
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,510
client-side utility to create a new

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:13,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">group using new group key and then you</font>

616
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:16,450
can add other members to this group

617
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:19,179
using add member very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> after this</font>

618
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,090
is done from application point of view

619
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:24,580
your H hey ray looks absolutely the same

620
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:26,230
as a single standalone device you just

621
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,289
need provide one token which is called

622
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:32,019
slot number<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samson and your client will</font>

623
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:34,000
talk to the whole array and by talking

624
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:35,649
to the whole array I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

625
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,409
he is created<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere it will be</font>

627
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,460
one load goes down you still will be

630
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:52,870
applications now I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a little</font>

631
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:59,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about suggested architecture by</font>

632
00:29:52,870 --> 00:30:02,590
default this<font color="#CCCCCC"> aluna devices can be</font>

633
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,750
created only in<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPC and again I shot</font>

634
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:07,240
from operation of the business people oh

635
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,600
this is not good you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

636
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,429
have them available from internet and I

637
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,928
was an you know it's a crazy idea to

638
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:18,820
expose the Slayer internet is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

639
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:21,010
probably in development into a you can

640
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,408
now really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is like probably</font>

641
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">more sensitive layers and databases do</font>

642
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">you ever expose</font>

643
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:30,299
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> internal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> database service on</font>

644
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:34,570
internet do you ever like make this is a

645
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:36,908
database server IP external never right

646
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,470
so moreover like even if your database

647
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:40,179
an internal you're trying to put a lot

648
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,830
of protections through firewalls and

649
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:43,769
jump boxes and everything to make sure

650
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that even from your corporate network</font>

651
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,129
nobody will be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> access it so I</font>

652
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,519
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when we talk about</font>

653
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:52,899
cryptography and the key management this

654
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,749
is like even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sensitive than</font>

655
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:57,369
database and you need to behave well

656
00:30:55,749 --> 00:31:00,879
here and you should not definitely

657
00:30:57,369 --> 00:31:04,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">should not expose this layer on internet</font>

658
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:07,899
so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> advice would be please keep it in</font>

659
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:12,609
VPC please Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses a private</font>

660
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:14,678
and if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to enable big</font>

661
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:18,629
population of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business server to</font>

662
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:21,759
talk to this layer use something like

663
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:23,649
proxy layer and again you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

664
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,299
several of them you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

665
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,918
load balance them to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

666
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:30,220
they're highly available and scalable

667
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:33,009
and on top of that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your use</font>

668
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,139
cases you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might want you may want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

669
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:37,440
implement additional security controls

670
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:39,219
and proxies like two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell</font>

671
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,739
additional authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

672
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">sterilization whatever you want so I</font>

673
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:46,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is like what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do</font>

674
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,820
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he sees is like here like three</font>

675
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,699
major security group red yellow and

676
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,189
green<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the security group as i said</font>

677
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,409
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstraction of firewall it's a</font>

678
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,129
simplified way of creating firewalls and

679
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:02,559
you can create<font color="#CCCCCC"> network rules and who can</font>

680
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:08,080
connect to whom waste of the security

681
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:11,049
groups so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ideal so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

682
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,428
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I described a little bit houses in</font>

683
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:17,649
groups that you find there is like yet

684
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,080
another equations that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask make sure</font>

685
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,939
lyrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace guys and there was like a</font>

686
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,529
very interesting answer that

687
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,330
cryptography doesn't solve all your

688
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:28,210
problems it just moves them to another

689
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,279
place and I couldn't hack the Morrises

690
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,789
because after you implemented on that

691
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,159
you still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find the way how you a</font>

692
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,560
syndicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your business plan to</font>

693
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">place yourself right</font>

694
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,700
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to have some</font>

695
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,060
secrets like you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have at least</font>

696
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,130
to this private client key that i was

697
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,470
looking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have pin</font>

698
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,560
credentials and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth so the</font>

699
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is when you instead starts in a</font>

700
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,690
cloud environment how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

701
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the right instance you don't</font>

702
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:03,150
want to put any credentials to am I the

703
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,030
user data you don't want to put it to

704
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:08,040
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Amazon s3 buckets even use a</font>

705
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:11,100
cryptid because as I mentioned before

706
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,960
our like mentality is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not trust</font>

707
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this out-of-the-box encryption</font>

708
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,790
solutions where you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not control the</font>

709
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,219
keys so if you cannot do any of that

710
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,800
then the question is still how you are

711
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,070
going to acenta<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kate your instance which</font>

712
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:29,159
are starting in her in cloud and to

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:34,340
enable this instance to talk to a clown

714
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:37,440
HSN so say is actually very simple and

715
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,540
similar to the situation when you don't

716
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,460
have any password the credentials and

717
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:45,389
what you call in somewhere for example

718
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,340
to your band can say and I am what

719
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,410
telling them what is your name where you

720
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,139
were born like what is the place and

721
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,150
they like major gnosis information using

722
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and database and then make any</font>

723
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,200
decision of the user right person if if

724
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,780
they can give you access to your

725
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial data so the same idea is here</font>

726
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:08,550
when instance start in a cloud

727
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:12,210
environment you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect a bunch of</font>

728
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:14,280
parameters using metadata HTTP interface

729
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,909
and the parameters that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use in my</font>

730
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,400
experiments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and listed here but it can</font>

731
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">be like more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than that for example I've</font>

732
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:28,290
heard about AWS implementing something

733
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,750
like private key which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique for</font>

734
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,300
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance right and then you can use</font>

735
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,820
signatures using this private key to

736
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,010
authenticate an instance better it's not

737
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,630
in this country in this solution and in

738
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,400
this considerations here but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

739
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">used so what I'm going to say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

740
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,650
like parameters that I used but you can

741
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually like explore and add more to</font>

742
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,389
make use your solution even were secure

743
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,459
so after client collectives

744
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,369
parameters and send it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the request</font>

745
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,500
what you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> on server site for</font>

746
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:00,869
example survey which distribute this

747
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,220
initial secrets can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in your</font>

748
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:09,630
internal data center you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a call</font>

749
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,609
back using AWS<font color="#E5E5E5"> API to AWS environment</font>

750
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,680
and fridge the same parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

751
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:17,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">here after you receive this parameters</font>

752
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,069
through AWS API you can do image what's

753
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:21,930
coming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and what API</font>

754
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:23,400
deterrent and use this parameter space

755
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,319
if you will have one hundred percent

756
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,359
match then this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

757
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:31,490
instance and you can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> down with the</font>

758
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters so like a couple of other</font>

759
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,680
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want to consider</font>

760
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:39,509
you might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hash all these</font>

761
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">parameters on server side when you</font>

762
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:44,130
receive them and create a map<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if the</font>

763
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,459
same instance it will try to initialize

764
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,829
itself one more time it just will return

765
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">access denied something this is one time</font>

766
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:53,730
use policy yet another things that you

767
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,190
might want to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> there how long</font>

768
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the instance was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan instance actually</font>

769
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:02,579
needs to be initialized once it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this</font>

770
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:05,279
kind of Secrets so when you make any

771
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,960
calls from AWS API<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're receiving the</font>

772
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:08,819
start date for the instance so you can

773
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,619
check how long the since this was dragon

774
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:12,000
but example if it's like was writing

775
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:14,640
more than five minutes again you can

776
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">return access denied so this is like</font>

777
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,900
additional security controls it you

778
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:25,559
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider now I think just</font>

779
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even more reliable we</font>

780
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,720
probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cessation as</font>

781
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">well because in your deployment you may</font>

782
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,368
have different kind different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

783
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:37,288

may have application servers database

785
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:42,960
servers and all of them I require

786
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,000
different kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets and to make</font>

787
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,559
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not given all secrets</font>

788
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,349
to everyone who is running in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

789
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:53,450
environment you might want to implement

790
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:55,589
a sterilization based on I am roles

791
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:57,899
unfortunately when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started researching</font>

792
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:00,150
it it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that obvious how all</font>

793
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,240
these objects are all small<font color="#CCCCCC"> Isha's</font>

794
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,920
instance profiling instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

795
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,759
connected

796
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,220
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is actually how it works</font>

797
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,110
you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a role and you can assign</font>

798
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,480
a number of policies to this role and

799
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:18,750
this policy will describe to what

800
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,720
resources this role has access to and

801
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,850
what kind of access it is then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

802
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to describe the instance profile</font>

803
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,620
and assign a role to this profile and

804
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:30,540
finally instance profile can be shared

805
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,450
between different instances for example

806
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,279
for all instances running in the same

807
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,549
outer skalian group you might want to

808
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,530
have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance profile was a</font>

809
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,080
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the scope of the solution</font>

810
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:46,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was considering policies are not</font>

811
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,340
even necessary here because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

812
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,460
things that you might want to validate

813
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:53,520
on the server is if instant belongs to

814
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunately there is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java</font>

815
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">API that allows you to do that this is</font>

816
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:04,310
like a court that is doing exactly that

817
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:07,470
it takes instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> and object and roll</font>

818
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:10,770
defined as a string and determine if

819
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:13,200
this instance belong to a room and again

820
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,030
it was not obvious it was not described

821
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,700
any award so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to do all the synonym</font>

822
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,800
eration my asked way double years would

823
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,500
be hey guys since like your reputation

824
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,630
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the most comprehensive</font>

825
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">cloward API why don't you have a single</font>

826
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:30,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">call something like is instance enroll</font>

827
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,040
this is how it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in value</font>

828
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:36,020
because writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the squad that looks</font>

829
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,940
funny and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not obvious at all</font>

830
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,810
finally I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

831
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,600
about automation so in the previous

832
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:48,390
slide I showed the OSIS manual steps and

833
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,990
it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> annoying especially if you</font>

834
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:54,089
consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud usually assumes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

835
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,700
great deal of automation so you might

836
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to automate the process of</font>

837
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,939
configuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luna devices una partition</font>

838
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:05,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Luna hjs as well I created a tool</font>

839
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,650
which I call Luna<font color="#CCCCCC"> beck and it's publicly</font>

840
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:14,520
available at this URL SF net dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> B /b /</font>

841
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">dinamic and it kind of experimental but</font>

842
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,460
I uses MVP approach when implemented it

843
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,220
MVP for those who doesn't know what

844
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,800
means minimal Viable Product so I heard

845
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,319
this like three major use cases when I

846
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,830
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a single petition on an</font>

847
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,790
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lonely device standalone</font>

848
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">idealize or an array of Lunas and I</font>

849
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:41,910
tested it it works well and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

850
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that if you want to implement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

851
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:48,180
solution implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> same and really</font>

852
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:51,060
helps and avoids a lot of manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

853
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:53,730
and mistakes which I usually come in

854
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,440
with ease so the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

855
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,450
would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to use this tool is to</font>

00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:02,189
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this JSON file you would</font>

858
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,900
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be described a number of objects</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create so you have</font>

860
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,750
petitions here you have Luna devices and

861
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,759
you have arrays<font color="#E5E5E5"> aluma devices after this</font>

862
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:16,170
jason is created you just runs at all

863
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,560
and you have all your claw<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM devices</font>

864
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:23,570
and client it<font color="#CCCCCC"> configure it there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,350
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> as when when when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

867
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,720
with cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM manually it will ask you</font>

like do I really want to initialize HS

scraping has actually was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

873
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:48,330
this output from cloud hsm and that's

874
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,630
why you have parameters here like input

00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">prompt finish prompt seems like that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Procida something like that so all of</font>

00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,490
that is addressed in the scope of this

880

tool it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cases that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

described<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know about any other</font>

882
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,890
cases so you can try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let you know so</font>

00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:13,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think this is this is what i want you</font>

886
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,140
you have really sensitive data like I

887
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,150
described in the very beginning like

888
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,700
real sick it's like past but passphrases

889
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:30,270
keys credit card numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> banking account</font>

890
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:31,919
number then you probably should consider

891
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,710
using cloud HSN as

892
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
data protection solution so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

893
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:40,079
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun and probably illegal</font>

894
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes common via do not trust them</font>

895
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,460
mindset at least a little bit probably

896
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:48,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not going to resolve all issues</font>

897
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:51,059
which are related to legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreements</font>

898
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,150
you know legal obligations as a ways

899
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:56,130
it's not going to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but data</font>

900
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:59,450
protection should be addressed here at

00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:59,450
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level of assurance</font>
