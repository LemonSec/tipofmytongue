00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:05,289
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and i do some blender 3d stuff</font>

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,479

20
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,920
my hobbies so you might see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

21
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,450
with them when we do the videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font>

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,020
these produced at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the</font>

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:16,680
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little video for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,679
most of 46 years old

25
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:25,969
this is the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel at hacker</font>

26
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:27,679
conferences and I don't really have a

27
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,048
handle and it's too likely to have one

28
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,159
now I understand you know I'd actually

29
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,479
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been suggesting handles but they</font>

30
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,579
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the word old in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,359
fill in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blank fart foggy you name it</font>

32
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:43,969
but if you had listened to me because

33
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:45,770
you have to get my lawn if you know why

34
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:48,020
this presentation and by the way the

35
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,628
name change I understand that it started

36
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,520
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a pen testing course about</font>

37
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:55,250
pentesting hackers organized

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,170
organizational skills kind of dull

39
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,899
actually and I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in here</font>

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,969
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about the things</font>

41
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,250
that when I go to courses to teach pen

42
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,708
testing and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to a couple in my</font>

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,109
life the things that you don't get

44
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,900
taught that we as pen testers are fairly

45
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:14,269
bad about we're not those organized

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,040
people in the world we're not the most

47
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:20,230
or we're not the most i guess you could

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,370
say we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really follow follow i</font>

49
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,130
guess you could say standards very well

50
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,599
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean it bulleted items</font>

51
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,170
exactly we liked it we like to be

52
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,220
creative and move around a little bit

53
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,099
which is give you a good thing i'll talk

54
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,720
about that later but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted</font>

55
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,488
to provide some advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot of</font>

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,849
which is based on mistakes that I've

57
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:44,810
made and continue to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes and</font>

58
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff and usually in the</font>

59
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,260
courses that you take on condensing also

60
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,230
computers are hard they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

61
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">really and this is also for those of you</font>

62
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are considering a career in infosec</font>

63
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:03,589
right I have a brother who is a medical

64
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,599
doctor brother-in-law I'm sorry

65
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,190
brother-in-law and I had a conversation

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,530
with him about our career as I said you

67
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,450
know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that I don't have the</font>

68
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you what you have</font>

69
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a doctor right I'm probably not</font>

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,099
as smart I don't have the discipline I

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,560
don't have what it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

72
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that to become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a doctor so it's not</font>

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,359
it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to however</font>

74
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least in medicine you have some</font>

75
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:31,100
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today that they</font>

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,800
were 100 years ago

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,970
no doctors doing operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> go slow what</font>

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,790
is that looks like we have a new bone

79
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,380
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean grazing</font>

80
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,090
that any right either that books what

81
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,220
200 years old or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

82
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,330
it's it's still the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it's</font>

83
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">still the same we know more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things about</font>

84
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,070
the skeleton about what's comprised of

85
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,510
but it still looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same and get the</font>

86
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:57,420
same bones and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

87
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are our standard in medicine i know</font>

88
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,200
they make developments and medicines but

89
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,890
it's we don't really have much of that

90
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,929
in infosec nancy question the books on

91
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">your shelf how many of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you n plus thick</font>

92
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,820
books raise your hand right how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are still referencing the same in</font>

94
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,880
focus head books that you reference to

95
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:20,608
five years ago meow which ones oh yeah

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah yeah biography is well yeah</font>

97
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,719
that's cool cryptography that's standard

98
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,830
biographies some programming languages

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,380
but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really like that</font>

100
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,450
hacking exposed looks for example their

101
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:36,169
shelter like like what two years for

102
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:38,729
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it doesn't last long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

103
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,609
we have moving targets I mean the

104
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,289
tactics the bad guys use the things are

105
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,510
attacking or changing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they</font>

106
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,250
attack them are changing and we are

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,930
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to study and learn and</font>

108
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,990
learn new things and it's a constant

109
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,460
constant moving target and we though

110
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,710
however we often make things harder on

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,659
ourselves then they should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

112
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,469
gonna talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for the madness</font>

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,509
presentation those considering career

114
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,530
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ester</font>

115
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,360
you're going to be a jack of all trades

116
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,409
you're going to be doing things like

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,909
you're gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to learning web</font>

118
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,110
application stuff one day and then the

119
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,250
next thing you'll be doing some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

120
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,939
physical testing for a client or

121
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless right so you might not get</font>

122
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:19,509
great at one thing but you're gonna have

than that raise your hand and you know

144
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,719

145
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,279
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than I do not som some of</font>

146
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:16,020
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I don't predictably expert</font>

147
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,129
everything so please shout it out so

148
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,008
especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets quiet because my</font>

computer's frozen or something and I say

152
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,599
examples are based in<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux that's what</font>

153
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,060
i use primarily as my workstation when I

154
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,620
do pen testing I'm not against window

155
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,449
using windows there's so many good tools

156
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,490
for linux to depend testing with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

157
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't had a need with the exception of</font>

158
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,580
a few things to use windows much for

159
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,219
that and obviously you need windows test

160
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,139
what does vulnerabilities and that sort

161
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:49,539
of thing but from just the launch

162
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint of the pen test i start with</font>

163
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,060
linux it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very technical talk</font>

164
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,710
it's just some basics and some of what

165
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,689
you're going to go do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear</font>

166
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that some of your going to go kind of</font>

167
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:03,250
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually targeting to</font>

168
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,719
two types of people people<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew or</font>

169
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,060
considered pen testing people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who've</font>

170
00:07:04,719 --> 00:07:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing a long time and have bad</font>

171
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,200
habits like me for example the old dog

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,590
new tricks kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

173
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,900
is definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicable here lastly if</font>

174
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:21,479
you think the presentation is lame to me

175
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:24,099
out enjoy the funny animated gifts and

176
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,080
so begins my advice tips ramblings to

177
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,640
make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life easier as a penetration</font>

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,740
tester how many your penetration testers

179
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,599
in hearing what do you some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

180
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:36,340
you how many think about our think about

181
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:41,190
doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> rich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and who aren't ya nuts</font>

182
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:44,260
first tipo it offers no no your scope I

183
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:51,670
love this one I think it's try to break

184
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:53,380
the ice whoops and failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so we</font>

185
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">often have when we approach a client or</font>

186
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,180
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> coaches us we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off have a very</font>

187
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,860
Lewis knowledge of the scope right we're

188
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,840
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approach this from the idea of</font>

189
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,280
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> an attacker and sometimes they</font>

190
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,659
want us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be completely what they call</font>

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,669
a black box testing we don't know

192
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,780
anything right because I'm attacker

193
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,910
would know anything coming in so you

194
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,380
should either well we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

195
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,250
can to start skating IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address deserve</font>

196
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">but we're looking for your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font>

197
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,660
with has some knowledge coming in

198
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,500
usually but the client is often wrong

199
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,660
about their own network twice at least

200
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,850
this is earlier on and now I hopefully

201
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know better I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told by clients</font>

202
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,820
here's our range Oliver hosted on this

203
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:36,100
range<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run off and good scans</font>

204
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:37,689
so you got like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hubs oh no three so I</font>

205
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,080
found this in this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

206
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,040
this oh no that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

207
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">your appearance yeah we're in there</font>

208
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,339
somewhere

209
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,720
my fault my fault you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my fault I</font>

210
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,670
should have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specific so I'm</font>

211
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,820
scanning some other people's systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

212
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:57,300
looking for vulnerabilities and yeah

213
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,280
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> no yeah exactly yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't had</font>

214
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,469
to account for that in any point my life

215
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,390
yet but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't hopefully</font>

216
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">would go beyond scanning I didn't start</font>

217
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,840
actually you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been better yeah</font>

218
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,080
can we get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed with you guys</font>

219
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:13,710
because I've already done things and

220
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:17,580
looking for free you know yeah exactly

221
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,380
exactly exactly I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people there were</font>

222
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,180
people that were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they got</font>

223
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,939
busted for this but they were actually

224
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">going out and sniffing it's your</font>

225
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,780
wireless networks and approaching the

226
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,370
people saying yeah here's your key we

227
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,680
were able to break it into it and use

228
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,720
them that's not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not good so</font>

229
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,489
uh scope creep you know what skirt group

230
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,190
scope is right so you're doing a project

231
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,580
of any kind and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're what you've</font>

232
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:48,480
agreed to do something becomes broader

233
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,650
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually the clients fault but</font>

234
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,930
you need to be clear when you when you

235
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,319
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up an engagement what it is you're</font>

236
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,760
expected to do and stop there and you

237
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,950
know what there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term called will you</font>

238
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,350
ever heard of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> term lon yup anyway</font>

239
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,020
here later it's a Cajun term I just a

240
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,360
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cajun hackers right that'd be</font>

241
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting with it the cajun hacker</font>

242
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:13,770
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd be a lot of fun exactly</font>

243
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,640
exactly yeah so letting up it means

244
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,780
giving somebody a little something extra

245
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,090
so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

246
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,800
extra stuff you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine throw</font>

247
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,590
something at them kind of keep them as

248
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,959
your client you know but keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

249
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,520
the scope they'll want you to do XY and

250
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,060
z on top of what you're already doing

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,579
and so they look for example they want

252
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,569
you to offer remediation what you found

253
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,940
when that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really in scope</font>

254
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,440
necessarily it's fine to give advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

255
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're giving us fine but they want</font>

256
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,520
to add clue that the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

257
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,599
then don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them creep your scope</font>

258
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the environment and a lot times</font>

259
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,910
you're working off site at a client site

260
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,459
and don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume you'll have internet</font>

261
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,660
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remote sites or if you have it</font>

262
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:00,459
now they'll tell you that oh yeah you

263
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,009
have internet and you find out well

264
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,949
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a proxy it's our internet</font>

265
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,079
right so you get to your future location

266
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:09,160
you get your tools which is I'm gonna

267
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,138
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> him it's a bad thing to do</font>

268
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,839
anyway you can't because everything's

269
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:17,379
proxy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also if you're using something</font>

270
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,610
like zapper or<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip sweet is it set to</font>

271
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,809
work through a proxy do you have you

272
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,990
know the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work it through</font>

273
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,189
a proxy or not if not that's something

274
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,139
it's gonna slow down quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

275
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:28,209
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepare for disasters on top of</font>

276
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:30,040
that talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that later we have</font>

277
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,729
actually a disaster recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> Porsche</font>

278
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,179
this talk so any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

279
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:40,029
comments yeah kind of kind of young

280
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:45,639
prepare your tools I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess shows for a</font>

281
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:52,149
second okay he's got a broom he's trying

282
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:55,269

283
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,879
it maybe frood in just based on this so

284
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,740
they got the inspiration for it update

285
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,509
everything before the engagement don't

286
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,100
wait to the client's site to start

287
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:06,730
updating tools you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

288
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,699
do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow you down and also test your</font>

289
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,689
stuff after you've updated it there's

290
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:12,969
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse than getting on site</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzing nothing works right I could</font>

292
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,540
never do an engagement I had all these

00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cool Ruby and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Python scripts I</font>

295
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,990
had rebuilt my system recently just

296
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:27,399
because I wanted a new verano clean

300
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,889
Ruby needs Ruby screw you say it's a

301
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,128
dependency for Ruby scripts to have Ruby

302
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,480
installed and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

303
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,100
all the other the modules and things

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you needed to check so you know</font>

check your stuff don't do major system

306
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,410
updates before engagement the

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,089
but still it's going to know when that

few tools I actually purchase for pen

317
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:15,509
testing but it's worth it by the way

318
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'll pause for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

319
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,949
more tooltips rehearse that sounds kind

320
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,239
of funny but walking the scenarios with

321
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,810
your tools who actually actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them before you go inside it's easy</font>

323
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,890
to set test networks and set up just

327
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,730
engineering like using set or you're

328
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,959
setting up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a fishing site you</font>

will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's aight works and</font>

330
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,529
looks proper because<font color="#E5E5E5"> frankly you only</font>

331
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,729
get one shot at that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

332
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,890
send<font color="#CCCCCC"> a messy knowledge of the clients</font>

333
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,870
emails addresses and then have it not

334
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,730
work and say oh sorry the fishing site

335
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,050
try this one's too you know they're

336
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be on to it at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point I</font>

337
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think so make sure it's working automate</font>

338
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,610
as much as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scripts that way</font>

339
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,199
you have some standardization if you're

340
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,700
using a script to run certain things

341
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,390
then every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you run it'll run the</font>

342
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:14,270
same way you won't have weird variances

343
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:18,709
in output and and other irregularities

344
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:21,730
it's a funny one I'm glad animagus work

345
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,750
here I was kind of surprised it did but

346
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,380
ok another little tip is a little tiny

347
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,800
tip title<font color="#E5E5E5"> your terminals how many of you</font>

348
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,540
have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than five terminals open in a</font>

349
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,339
given time<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it like a pent a story</font>

350
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,599
when you're working normally how would

351
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,300
have you forget what's running on the

352
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,920
several sometimes this is an important

353
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">one writes my head already just to get</font>

354
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,430
the shy people out how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

355
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,910
closed the terminal screen not knowing

356
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,260
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was and lost data or output or</font>

357
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,500
we're having to start something all over

358
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,040
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah me here I i was i was</font>

359
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,240
actually cracking a password hash and i

360
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,569
think i was using the rocky password

361
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,410
list a big long one and i was about

362
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:05,720
three hours into it and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

363
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,850
screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> I clicked on closed it and I had</font>

364
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">started over again you know actually</font>

365
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,339
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back it was one it was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

366
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,990
the tools that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start</font>

367
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,670
off we left off and i think was mmmm in

368
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,990
Hydra no that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Jack it was John the</font>

369
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,290
Ripper so I had to start all over again

370
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think but anyway all awesome work so</font>

371
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,099
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually to show you this you</font>

372
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,130
can actually you may not know this you

373
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,130
may

374
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,770
in most<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux distros you can actually</font>

375
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,820
there's your turmoil no sister no up

376
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:40,010
there you get you a terminal it's a

377
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:42,020
title and call it yeah there you go yeah

378
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,970
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can call it leave open or</font>

379
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,460
something I recall it in map or

380
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,960
something and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pick a type and</font>

381
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,550
there you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a map the top</font>

382
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,810
screen you can call in map and then have

383
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ranger running on so you know which</font>

oh is it clanking yeah it is great I had

388
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,220
two badges on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cowbell</font>

389
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,770
walking around calling playing goodness

390
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:13,400
off here so you get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> off I have to</font>

391
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:17,720
step button looks like a contortionist

392
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:24,370
thing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go to the video and</font>

393
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:34,790
then yeah we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of that</font>

394
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:36,080
post so action<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright yeah alright so</font>

395
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,390
you can you can you can change the term

396
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,260
hold title and it keeps you keeps you

397
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,970
organized where you're working let's see

398
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,069
next one file naming tips this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

399
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I really fail that because</font>

400
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,520
I'll have after an engagement of doing

401
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,490
all these different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in map</font>

402
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,130
and doing Derby or whatever I'll have

403
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this incredibly huge pile of files in</font>

404
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:01,520
one folder and sometimes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

405
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is which I output text what is</font>

406
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,650
that you know in map text okay what's in

407
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,198
map that narrows it down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

408
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,990
IP addresses so come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

409
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,820
convention where you note for example

410
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,959
I'll do like in mad dash and then I'll

411
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,540
have something they'll identify the IP

412
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">address maybe I'll identify what kind of</font>

413
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,270
scan it was TTP rather than UDP and then

414
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,010
that way when you're doing reporting

415
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,629
this is really well to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

416
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,859
slow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> down if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do it this</font>

417
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,050
way I mean if you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wave</font>

418
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,419
identifying files reporting is even

419
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,149
worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is which is you don't</font>

420
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,160
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be but it can create a</font>

421
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,060
folder<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well that this</font>

422
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,220
logical

423
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,330
and makes sense data collecting it's

424
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,760
very important we do a lot of data

425
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:50,960
collecting we do pen testing everything

426
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:53,930
from the initial we're doing

427
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,480
reconnaissance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to screenshots my</font>

428
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,330
favorite tool of recent discovery is

429
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,550
they use no case bro heard of it it's

430
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,020
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a free tool there's a free version i</font>

431
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,210
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay for the full thing because</font>

432
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">i would like it enough that it was worth</font>

433
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:10,190
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me to buy it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and to have every</font>

version and every every platform for

435
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,930
lifetime but also I you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

436
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
money that projects that actually work

437
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,830
sometimes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them out no</font>

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,790
case pro i'm going to show you this is a

442
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,800
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I was really frustrated</font>

443
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,570
with screenshots and what to do with

444
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,430
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his files come in a word</font>

working foot screen shots in it reduces

447
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,530
the size down where you can't read

448
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,139
what's on the screen on you can't read

449
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,870
the data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually allows you to</font>

450
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,780
create a hierarchal set of notes here

<font color="#CCCCCC">and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did here was I I p address</font>

octet the last octet I just separate

453
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,810
each one by that so the notes are

454
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,900
separate here for each system and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

databse in here notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for example</font>

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:17,150
little color cut for you what's nice

mind is a mine manager or mine mind

471
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,550
mapping thank you I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

472
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it commercially thing called my manager</font>

473

maps that can be helpful on smaller

engagements I'm doing like I bet script

doing if your needs to sort of like a

482
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,649
brainstorming kind of stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

483
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,680
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to use this just to</font>

484
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:25,770
create kind of a map in reports though

485
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,840
for cut for clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger map standin</font>

up they tend to not scale very well you

487
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,550
know and I tried that<font color="#CCCCCC"> once with like in</font>

488
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,719
that results having like the systems and

489
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,490
then all the different port different

490
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,470
ports are open but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be too big</font>

491
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,110
so I stopped doing that but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

492
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,120
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cub cool tool it's easy to</font>

493
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,550
script things to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into format that</font>

494
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:52,260
it uses to create the maps<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so that's</font>

495
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:56,010
that's kind of useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so you</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for every purchase of of milk a pro</font>

498
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,360
yeah I check out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the free version of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that to think of it I like it a lot i</font>

500
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,620
was using something called note key for

501
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,200
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for a while as is so</font>

502
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,179
buggy crash and it's not good Frankie

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:24,629
it crashes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collection</font>

506
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,159
tools and tips screen captures now you

507
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,890
can use the Print Screen button on your

508
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,120
keyboard works pretty well<font color="#CCCCCC"> or alt print</font>

509
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,740
screen for the individual window I like

510
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,959
being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually take a portion of</font>

511
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,390
the window and capturing it not so

512
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,690
the whole window keep my report smaller

513
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,789
to focus in on what Gotham to see so I

514
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">Politico you shudder I know select tools</font>

515
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,299
for windows out there do screen capture

516
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,559
I like shutter for linux there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

517
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,980
called squat which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

518
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:57,750
unfortunate name for a tool sorry my

519
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:00,720
daughter's own anyway and squad is a

520
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">command line screen capture tool which</font>

521
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,409
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way it's kind of pointless</font>

522
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,549
because what you're going to get a

523
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:09,720
screen capture driver you typing the

524
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:12,210
word squat to run it but you can

525
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually create like a cron job and have</font>

526
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,419
it take screen captures once ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you</font>

527
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,090
know men in or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of keep</font>

528
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it keep track of what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

529
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:21,178
there are uses for it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really</font>

530
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">used it much but it's out there there's</font>

531
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,880
also a cool tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out not long</font>

532
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:30,620
ago and it's based on two things one is

533
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,149
a in that script called HTTP screenshot

534
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,860
which is basic which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also based on</font>

535
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:39,570
the WK HTML to image tool what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does</font>

536
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,809
basically is<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow sure what an nmap</font>

537
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,899
scan and<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems running for 80 or</font>

538
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:49,440
443 or whatever you have designated 8008

539
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:51,840
or whatever other HTML ports are open it

540
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,130
will screenshot the front page of the

541
00:22:51,840 --> 00:23:00,149
website for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as you scan it's a</font>

542
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">little slow and it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work well</font>

543
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:06,029
with dynamic sites like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ajax and things</font>

544
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,039
that move around<font color="#E5E5E5"> on web pages but it</font>

545
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,510
does an okay job also web<font color="#CCCCCC"> pages like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

546
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,000
a subdirectory somewhere and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

547
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:13,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font>

548
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,830
good job of just getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

549
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:19,049
screen to give an idea of what's running

550
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,549
on the system and its automated which is

551
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,770
cool so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run this</font>

552
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:26,580
against the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address range and it will</font>

553
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:28,110
output a directory full of images of the

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">website running along</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the IP</font>

555
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,639
addresses as well so

556
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:44,809
close my mouth<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions let's see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> royal</font>

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">command line tools v most have an output</font>

558
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,070
option you want to use your pen testing

559
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,650
I like for example yellow know probably

560
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,770
in map the OA which is what i use which

561
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,420
is the output all formats you know and

562
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you follow a with the name you want to</font>

563
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,230
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and usually i do like the IP</font>

564
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,320
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something not every tool you</font>

565
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:06,260
use on command line where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

566
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,669
output<font color="#CCCCCC"> that every tool do you get an</font>

567
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,200
option like that so you have to do

568
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,950
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to do that this actually</font>

569
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,330
works in windows too again this very

570
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,340
rudimentary for lucky with ascending

571
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,409
like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will know about you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

572
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,689
type or redirect the output to up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

573
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,690
text file so if your tool doesn't have

574
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,990
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of output option use the clear</font>

575
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,110
that symbol to pump it out to a text

576
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,630
file there you have your output so we

577
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,590
might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about that that's really</font>

578
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,990
depressing for me no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad you all</font>

579

580
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:46,600
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about that because</font>

593
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,430
part of the pen test we don't like at

594
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:30,430
the end that we have to sit at our desks

595
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,380

know so there it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dentist I</font>

602
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,340
think to do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> report forming head</font>

603
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,250
pictures things and his strings of

604
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:55,389
characters not the same bleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a</font>

605
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:57,790
joke by the way not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with words okay</font>

606
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:01,570
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that one out finish I'd say</font>

607
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not people so I mentioned earlier</font>

608
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,840
keeping it organized can make reporting

609
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,790
much easier if you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font>

610
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,919
time digging for data through all of

611
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,230
your your results for the report<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

612
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,930
can be a pain also write scripts to

613
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,510
convert output like the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> in map</font>

614
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:18,730
studies an epic example to format easier

615
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:21,280
to insert your document so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've written</font>

616
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,050
a script actually that converts in map

617
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,920
outputs feel like a really nice looking

618
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:29,290
more structured type of format i can

619
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,660
copy and paste into a document if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need</font>

620
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,270
to that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that also there's a build a</font>

621
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,500
ski doc if you heard of that i actually

622
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,050
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from personal matt to sorrow</font>

623
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,200
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically a text on document</font>

624
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:43,899
format that you can actually script for

625
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,120
example maybe in that output into this

626
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,450
format and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's translatable into</font>

627
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,479
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the PDF so you can take</font>

628
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,820
simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> than maps can use a ski dock to</font>

629
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,920
convert it to a PDF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that look right</font>

630
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,540
there is good enough

my 12 year old kittens basement it

679
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,440
sounds a lot better to say yeah it was

<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy that they targeted us and you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">him you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the case</font>

684
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,190
though that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that give</font>

685
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,350
this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice okay let's hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a jewel</font>

686
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,330
thief and you're walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the road and</font>

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:30,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry you got a jewel thief you're a</font>

688
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">total</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid the difference here you're</font>

689
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,290
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid walking the right you</font>

690
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,260
see this person's house their doors open

691
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:38,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">and there is a diamond necklace on the</font>

692
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,060
table and no one's watching you walk in

693
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,310
grab it and the media reports jewel

694
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,950
thieves raid the house of zone zone well

695
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,919
it was a 12 year old kid right it was

696
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,290
easy to do but let's reverse that and

jewel thief<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're smart right mean</font>

724
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:57,110
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go the easier route well</font>

725
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,469
the same is true with computers we want

726
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:02,679
to think like this guy now by the way my

727
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,820
at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> five year old daughter I</font>

728
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:09,110
Commission her to create a picture of a

729
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:11,470
I called it the computer bad guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

730
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:16,580
a bad guy because he has a goatee

731
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:18,110
and as I browser are down because as she

732
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:25,629
pointed out to his five if they were up

733
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:25,629
it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a computer sad guy not a threat</font>

734
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,710
the problem though is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

735
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,610
think like this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we need to learn</font>

736
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think like these people to write not</font>

737
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,879
just that not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's the apt</font>

738
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:44,210
is the professional hacker but also the

739
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,610
random employee<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's careless and</font>

740
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,310
stumbles upon things that can beat up a

741
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,510
kid but you never know some kids going

742
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into something accidentally my</font>

00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,760
clothes and five were the things open

748
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:07,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I today I think figure out what she</font>

749
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">hid my point is is that we learn need to</font>

750
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,970
learn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think on all these different</font>

751
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,590
levels right as a pen tester because if

752
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,860
you just think about the higher tax and

753
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

754
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,229
low-hanging fruit first of all default

755
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">ranchos right now this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having me more</font>

756
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,180
than once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a team on a</font>

757
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,560
pen test and I'm writing these buzzing

758
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,120
scripts things like that and get ready

759
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know I'm looking at that the</font>

760
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,229
versions of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftp server and looking</font>

761
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,750
for by the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually do my</font>

762
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,700
internet search my teammate is already

763
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">in because he tried adding an admin on</font>

764
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the log in and got in right bad</font>

765
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,760
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidy and clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tags social</font>

766
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,229
engineering very very non-technical you

767
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,660
know let's take a type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> person to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font>

768
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:56,000
it off that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumpster diving open</font>

769
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:58,250
wireless networks a big one so which is

770
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,550
a higher risk default passwords are owed

771
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,340
is your day which<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's higher</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> default</font>

772
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:07,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords why there's more of them</font>

773
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,959
they're easier right all right so which

774
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:14,480
findings were valuable to a client yeah

775
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,390
now find above don't get me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

776
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,860
fine but don't overlook the easy stuff

777
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,860
because that's how people are giving it

778
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,600
I think I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> open the learn to think</font>

779
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,340
also like like someone's grandmother

780
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">right not just the highly skilled</font>

781
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:35,050
adversary that's an important part yeah

782
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:38,570
this is a story I learned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard way I</font>

783
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:40,310
was asked by client to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pen past and</font>

784
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:43,040
they wanted this year we do every year

785
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,450
for this client<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the fall and they</font>

786
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't exist anymore as a client they're</font>

787
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,610
actually company is gone so I can talk

788
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:53,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more free than they won</font>

789
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:56,030
two physical pin test so okay they're

790
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,760
building was a four story office

791
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:01,700
building that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> occupy the second</font>

792
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,129
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every other every other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten at</font>

793
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,430
the building<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all given these you</font>

794
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,590
know cards to<font color="#E5E5E5"> key in right security</font>

795
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">cards and they turn to the scanners off</font>

796
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:15,169
at seven a.m. in the morning sector

797
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:18,470
seven a.m. until about 8pm there's no

798
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:20,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">she just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walk in now you walk in the</font>

799
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:22,399
side stairwell up to second floor oh the

800
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,589
client was with the state saying and

801
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,319
you're in an office area suddenly we're

802
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,550
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there no other people</font>

803
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,530
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there at the office is mostly</font>

804
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,870
empty but the server room which by the

805
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,040
way it was a converted office and you

806
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,230
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually open the tiles up and</font>

807
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,270
ceiling look over into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server I</font>

808
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,429
didn't Carl over though that I didn't

809
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:44,000
hurt myself a break time so i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> took</font>

810
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:46,220
pictures but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terberg was right there</font>

811
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and had this kind of lock on it missing</font>

812
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:51,830
these locks surely you have it's called

813
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">a simplex lock and i was studying at the</font>

814
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,989
way these work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

815
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,720
five buttons you can push a combination

816
00:34:56,989 --> 00:35:01,430
in but the catch is is that each button

817
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,490
can be pushed one time in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination</font>

818
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,839
so you can't have a combination 1123 you

819
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,149
get one two three or one two three four

820
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,200
but you can't push the button twice you

821
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,670
can also push two buttons at the same

822
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,339
time so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like the</font>

823
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,080
combination of one and three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then 24</font>

824
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,300
so on and so forth and then you turn the

825
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,540
handle and it'll reset it you let you in

826
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,000
or you try again so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what was on</font>

827
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,290
the door so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did i first</font>

828
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,210
calculated how many combinations are

829
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,250
aware for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> given you can't push the</font>

830
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,270
same button twice with five buttons<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

831
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,940
think there was about a hundred twenty

832
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,230
possibilities you know I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

833
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,340
narrow it down a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

834
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,540
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to go up there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

835
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,869
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically go to the door and</font>

836
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,660
try

837
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:40,609
what I knew and get in or not get in so

838
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,240
I took a dry waste marker and I put a

839
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:46,730
little daughter in each button I came

840
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">back the next day and all the buttons</font>

841
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,740
were wiped off except for one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

842
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:54,859
one so two three four and five are part

843
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,419
of the combination but not one<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 32</font>

844
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:59,808
possible combinations at this point i

845
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:02,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like under 40 so I pull a</font>

846
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:04,220
chair up because nobody's around click

847
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,629
click click click click click click and

848
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,359
I try and I think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> twelfth time</font>

849
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was in open the door take a picture</font>

850
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:11,328
inside I'm like doing a little happy

851
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:15,230
dance that we do like it spent estrogen

852
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:16,490
you know and I report<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

853
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,440
about it and they say oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible</font>

854
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,089
you know the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year I come back and</font>

855
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">send client and they'd actually replace</font>

856
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:26,058
us with biometric lock cool you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

857
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,910
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where this is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my pride</font>

858
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:31,369
got knocked down to a lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> level here</font>

859
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:34,098
I'm leaning against a door looking at

860
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,180
the biometric lock or the key and I

861
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:39,140
noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I leaned against the</font>

862
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,749
door it opens a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit I can see the</font>

863
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,839
latch take my credit card out pop I'm

864
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:47,180
yet and so I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain the client</font>

865
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:49,609
that this is something I didn't see the

866
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,169
year before I completely missed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

867
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:53,029
year before I was so busy trying to

868
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,579
crack the lock combination they had a

869
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:58,999
much more costly<font color="#CCCCCC"> bull more globally on</font>

870
00:36:55,579 --> 00:37:00,440
the door than that I didn't see that so

871
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:03,259
you know they bought a piece of metal

872
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,989
covered it up fifty bucks and always

873
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:07,910
well but yeah actually I had a little

874
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:10,670
momentary you know victory there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

875
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:13,129
then I thought oh gosh I should see in a

876
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:14,450
previous year but actually they<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me</font>

877
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,450
that enough in the meeting why do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

878
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">say the previous year we did wasn't</font>

879
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:26,629
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir is there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next lesson here</font>

880
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,569
don't rush recon<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

881
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,940
daddy daycare kids gone to the bathroom

882
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:34,239
inside and the bathroom<font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking messy</font>

883
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,239
made

884
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:43,618
so this goes along the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing about</font>

885
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the easiest for thanks for example in</font>

886
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,859
recon you learned for example email

887
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,140
addresses clues about what technologies

888
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:51,660
are running you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool</font>

889
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,190
called cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use that before it'll</font>

890
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,348
actually it'll go through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

891
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,999
put it at a website of the client<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

892
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,589
will actually it'll actually filter that

00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:02,629
website for keywords to use his

894
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:05,670
passwords so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you pointed at</font>

895
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,769
NFL com you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a bunch of NFL</font>

896
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:11,299
teams and football terminologies you can

897
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:13,709
use this password file it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool</font>

00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:15,720
broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows if I heard the concert</font>

899
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,999
broken windows it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a cool</font>

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't heard it in New York</font>

901
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:24,450
they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with with crime on</font>

902
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:26,009
subways and so they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean</font>

903
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,589
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subways and take the graffiti</font>

904
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:30,990
off and it took the criminals who the

905
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:33,749
owners were you know and change the you

906
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,689
can tell a lot from a website by things

907
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:39,328
like broken links outdated styles if

908
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:44,279
they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> animated gifts like I do</font>

909
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:45,779
and scrolling Marquis then not only is

910
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:49,170
their site about<font color="#CCCCCC"> of date maybe the</font>

911
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:51,359
security as well is out of date right so

912
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:54,859
those are clues to make all the

913
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,700
inductive method of observing you

914
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:58,828
observe observation is the most

915
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,989
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of this you observe first</font>

916
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:04,140
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> interpret what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

917
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">observed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you apply a solution</font>

918
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,098
to that that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inductive</font>

919
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:11,099
method the observation is really

920
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,630
important and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recon face is very</font>

921
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">important as well I will go this very</font>

922
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly uh this is this is used a lot i</font>

923
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:20,190
know at conferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hearts vs ninja</font>

00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">cover here pirates are always an attack</font>

926
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:26,220
they're very brutal not terribly

927

organized rely on force more than

928
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,879
tactics a lot of times and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

929
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,619
fun though right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

930
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,700
just the fun part who'd rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a fire</font>

931
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,289
engine ninjas were disciplined surgical

932
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,029
and their techniques were organized and

933
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:41,369
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as much fun but can be</font>

934
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:43,190
more lethal right let me face it ninja

935
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus pirate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one on one</font>

936
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,970
probably not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much of a fight it</font>

937
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,019
despite your you know saw you take on

938
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:54,959
this argument because I know it's a very

939
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:57,598
passionate one or maybe we're talking to

940
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,369
art versus science this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of funny</font>

00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,558
he's been of nerve lookers he's got risk

944
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:07,769
formula I think you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scientist part Thanks reporting it's</font>

956
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,710
the artistic part the pen testing as a

scientist covers all the areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

points in<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get very meticulous</font>

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,869
doesn't do soil<font color="#CCCCCC"> then predictable right</font>

963
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,089
if it's off the script if it's something

964
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:50,059
not in the pen testing execution

965
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:52,410
standard they might do so well on it

966
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:55,019
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> imma stinks but not explicitly</font>

967
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,670
spelled out in the framework so what do

968
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,038
we do we got weaknesses and shrinks and

969
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:02,279
here's an example we have phases hear of

970
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,650
a pentax recon analysis exploitation

971
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,989
post exploitation and reporting and you

972
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,910
gotta get this at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

973
00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:14,489
you know the scientists will go through

974
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:16,469
this set my step and report done where

975
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,210
the art the artistic part the pirate

976
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:22,019
part of you comes in is that you're able

977
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:24,269
to at any point go back and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:26,008
found things of here let's go back and

979
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:27,359
analyze let's go back and recon based on

980
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this let's go back and look at you know</font>

981
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,078
in other words it's no longer a linear

982
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,538
thing it's more of just kind of a more

983

fluid ice even seen as a circle which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

984
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's quite accurate either</font>

985
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,430
but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking on your feet a</font>

986
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more you're being a little more</font>

987
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,328
creative right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sticking to</font>

988
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:43,229
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then you're getting back to</font>

989
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:44,640
it again though that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important</font>

990
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:46,828
thing you're leaving it when you need to

991
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,500
and you're getting back and finishing

992
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:54,650
out the framework makes sense

993
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:57,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us are you know like i</font>

994
00:41:54,650 --> 00:42:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">said it's often the the we want to be</font>

995
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:03,859
more the pirate<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we won't be more</font>

996
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,990
that you might see the movie up was it

997
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,760
called swordfish the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad movie</font>

998
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,520
about yeah and the scene where he's

999
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,940
hacking and got some wine he's clapping

1000
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,840
and you know looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the screen yeah</font>

1001
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure has to do with this but I</font>

1002
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">really annoyed annoys me know is it's</font>

1003
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,420
like the artistic part you know it's

1004
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the fun close your eyes type on</font>

1005
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,390
this type on the keyboard kind of thing

1006

<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's ridiculous you need the science</font>

1007
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:33,140
in there as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well let's see how this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1008
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,700
kind of recap here we have said don't

1009
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,529
focus heavily on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> points you</font>

1011
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the place then you might miss some</font>

1012
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,020
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sakir framework and venture off</font>

1013
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,090
when you need to but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> return to it</font>

1014
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,440
and make sure you cover all the points

1015
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> framework anybody heard the pts</font>

1016
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,160
10 pts framework the standard yeah it's

1017
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,319
a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard to work with</font>

1018
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,399
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't gets complete I think</font>

1019
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,400
it'll bit weak in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

1020
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,930
security part but but it's actually a

00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">very rarely probably the best one out</font>

1022
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:03,890
there right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think okay at a point</font>

you're keeping on that you losing the

1031

parking lot or drop it somewhere yeah I

1032
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,640
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if they never get never to get</font>

1034
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,920
just that trust between you in the

1035
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,720
client and that's never good so right

1036
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,320
hey all yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the NDA as well yeah you</font>

1037

system unencrypted client contamination

1039
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,740
for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can often be doing two</font>

1040
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,720
different this happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> me once I was</font>

1041
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,729
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin test for client I gave the</font>

1042
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,810
phone report and they asked me what's

1043
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:55,820
this IP address I don't recognize this

1044
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:57,980
hostname some of a previous client I use

1045
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,570
the report as a format as they ever did

1046
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,000
for use a previous report as a template

1047
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,490
and you can scrub<font color="#E5E5E5"> it properly yeah so</font>

1048
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,710
that was embarrassing lawsuits perhaps

1049
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,118
in Las reputation for your company BP

1050
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,400
oil spill there was an incident there

1051
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,740
were a insurance adjuster<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's visiting</font>

1054
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,790
because the company came out and said we

1055
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,170
what everybody know about this laptop

1056
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,369
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should worry about it because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we have the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to eat this</font>

1059
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,400
remotely turn off that and disable that

1060
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:33,680

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all they said was we have the</font>

ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remotely disable the system</font>

1064
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,790
it's not encrypted why would they

1065
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,618
mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was encrypted what's it</font>

1066
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,490
stuck junk about totally disabled I mean

1067
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:51,010
you know exactly exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so and nobody</font>

1068
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,450
is what happened to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably</font>

1072
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,720
has an encryption option as a matter of

1073
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,210
fact you can save an encrypted format as

1074
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,850
well truecrypt there's others out there

1118
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,500
it's a big risk being able to continue

00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,390

really do that medium if they're nice

here by going always always always yes

1133
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:32,059
actually yeah

1134
00:47:28,299 --> 00:47:33,770
um a sexism would be great actually just

a lot to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring with you you know and I</font>

that CD and run that CD and still work

1142
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,460
in that have your data and stuff backed

won't lose your scripts if you're a

1147
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:04,190
via via upv pn I'm said you can VPN that

1148
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:05,150
might have a possible or much site

1149
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,740
because you want to be able to connect

1150
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:08,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPN putting on the clients network</font>

1151
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,640
but that's probably best solution is

1152
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,629
having remotely stored somewhere safe

1153
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,509
and over an encrypted transmission

1154
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:20,270
method abacus system is preferable but

1155
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:22,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be maintained</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and hard drive or</font>

1156
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:24,380
rated a laptop is also a good idea as

1157
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,030
well it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more work involved</font>

1158
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:28,160
and you have to clone it and if you have

1159
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,480
data to get a clone it again keep it the

1160
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,680
same script tips script it like that
