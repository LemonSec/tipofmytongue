00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,230
so who's seen this website this website

entire last con schedule on there and

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,540

11
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:50,890
by clicking and choosing the talks that

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,720
you want to see so it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,729
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick last year when I spoke here</font>

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,339
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross-site scripting in the</font>

15
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">pages that you're able to create your</font>

16
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">profile and your talk description so i</font>

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put a little cross that</font>

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,880
scripting code in it so that if you came

19
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">across my talk or my profile it would</font>

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,729
automatically add my talk to your

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:15,130
schedule so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of fun</font>

22
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:18,189
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I could do</font>

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:21,820
that again and so last year I used this

24
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the injection with a little pipe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acid</font>

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,949
there was a strange thing where if you

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,169
had a slash in before the event handler

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,850
that it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not pay attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,380
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word you would be able to</font>

29
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">bypass it and you also see that there's</font>

30
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,789
equal space because I didn't put the

31
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:39,509
words right after the equal sign

32
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:43,569
whatever rules they were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

33
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,969
bypassing them so when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested it this</font>

34
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:48,549
year they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually fixed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slash</font>

35
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:51,908
bypass and block the onmouseover

36
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:54,700
keywords and a bunch of others but

37
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,259
fortunately there's a lot of event

38
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,189
handlers that you're able to use what

39
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,850
you're going to cross-site scripting

40
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:02,048
right I mean there's enormous amounts

41
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,240
and they're adding new ones the

42
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,719
specifications all the time so this year

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,478
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of them in a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

44
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,579
and boom still path across that

45
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,600
scripting on the same site this time you

46
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,160
can use the on mouse out function so

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,709
yeah cross-site scripting right on that

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,329
side black let's do not work so try them

49
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:26,920
when you're securing a website alright

50
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,540
so those one so the title this talk is

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,790
view this abstract in your browser my

00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:38,310
talking about authorization

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,679
vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> PII that's personally</font>

telephone numbers you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you consider yours and you</font>

83
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,260
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody to have them unless</font>

84
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,569
you explicitly gave it to them and we're

85
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,500
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about Google doors</font>

86
00:03:53,569 --> 00:04:00,899
club if you know what if you're a dork

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,379
is a couple of you google the works

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,870
right now that is not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google to work</font>

89
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:10,530
although you might consider it to be

90
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:12,930
Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> dorking okay this is really what</font>

91
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's using highly specific</font>

92
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,680
Google search queries to find

93
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:22,560
vulnerabilities it's used by black hats

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,380
to quickly find websites to hack rather

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,080
than searching the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet doing</font>

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,729
a network scan for port 80 and seeing

97
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,039
what websites are out there and then

98
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,690
seeing if they're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the older</font>

99
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,699
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the patchy or something like</font>

100
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,520
that they'll simply use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google query</font>

101
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,020
and search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> keywords</font>

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,219
that web server might have on that

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">website it's also a popular way to</font>

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,520
automate botnet exploitation so a little

105
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,229
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a side right there if you don't</font>

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this already a lot of botnets what</font>

107
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:58,039
they'll end up doing is having the bots

108
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,299
do use<font color="#CCCCCC"> google dorks to search for</font>

109
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,039
vulnerable websites they might be

110
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for like a wordpress site or</font>

111
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,940
something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they find</font>

112
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,349
them they'll actually attempt exploits

113
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,830
against those servers so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

114
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:16,069
the ways that but Annette's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex fine</font>

115
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,719
servers to exploit and then grow so a

116
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,069
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dorking and</font>

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,030
your if you don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

118
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:25,580
you'll get it as we go go along<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

119
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,440
you're using very specific filters in

120
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,969
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search query rather than</font>

121
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,919
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for the contents of a</font>

122
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,810
couple of words on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the page you can use</font>

123
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,789
all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other filters for example</font>

124
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can search by file type let's say</font>

125
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:40,190
you only want to bring back dot PHP

126
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,560
files or dot s PX files because you're

127
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,460
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for a server to exploit</font>

128
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,500
something that's for those frameworks

129
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,989
there's also the filter in title so you

130
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,029
might do a in title search for admin

131
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,469
portal and the title<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be what</font>

132
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,020
you see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of your window when</font>

133
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:58,759
you're browsing the web site evil cams

134
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,330
another interesting one if you use that

135
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually find a lot of web cams</font>

136
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,539
that are publicly available on the

137
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,380
internet that have been unsecured by

138
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:12,979
using an entitled search for evo camp in

139
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,229
url so if you do a search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that it's</font>

140
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:18,050
instead of actually checking this text

141
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the website it's going to be testing</font>

142
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,110
the URL of the website and looking for

143
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,840
that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the examples PHP my</font>

144
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,740
admin or download under Scott underscore

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,619
hub PHP and and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically looking</font>

147
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,120
this allows you to filter specific

148
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,500
domains so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're looking for a</font>

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,270
news article but wanted to limit it to

150
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,789
the new york time so you could do site

151
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,740
in New York Times calm and then you'd

152
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,560
only be searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> that website you could</font>

153

do the same thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say you're</font>

cash that's not really a Google dork but

157
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:05,270
very useful what cash is if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:08,330
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of your string and</font>

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">then a URL after that instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that's</font>

160
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,900
useful for when the page is actually

161
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:15,620
gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> down so web servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the page</font>

162
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,030
offline but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google caches every page</font>

163
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,190
that it sees or merely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a page that</font>

164
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,169
it sees so that will actually return the

165
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,090
google cache of that page so you'll

166
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,919
still be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the content even if</font>

167
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,159
the owner of the website has taken that

168
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:31,430
information down and then it's good to

169
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,160
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do negatives so you</font>

can do- file type if you want to exclude

171
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,570
PDF files and we want to filter your

172
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,860
search just a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more so how</font>

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">could this be used here's a really cool</font>

176
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:55,669
PHP my admin so PHP might admit that's a

PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> build application for managing my</font>

178
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:02,120
sequel databases and it's a pretty

179
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,560
powerful framework because if you're if

180
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,120
you're able to control my sequel

181

database you're actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

compromise the entire machine based on

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,960
the privileges that my sequel has in

184
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:16,060
most cases so you can see here that this

185

simple or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> returned 21,000 results and</font>

186

if you're wondering what happens when

187
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,580
you click on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those pages it</font>

188
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually takes you right into a PHP my</font>

189
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,599
admin console from there you can run

190
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,460
sequel queries against the database draw

191
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,470
tables to whatever malicious things you

192
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:34,789
want and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find thousands of these</font>

193
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,169
sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by searching Google and if I</font>

194
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,370
were to guess I'd say most of the ones

195
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,380
that you're able to find on that search

196

197
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,580
they've all had been hacked a dozen

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">times maybe and but they're still</font>

realized it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and taking it down</font>

201
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,180
alright so back to the back to the topic

202
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:58,100
at hand email because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that's</font>

203
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,729
what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into so using</font>

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of imagination I'll show you</font>

206
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,979
how to discover personally identifiable

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,980
information without even breaking a

208
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,300

<font color="#E5E5E5">the top of the page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it says click here</font>

233
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,480
to view this email online and that's

234
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,310
you'll see a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,160

<font color="#E5E5E5">like where did these things go and now</font>

239
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,410
surprise that when i click these things

240
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,200
I wasn't prompted to type in my username

241
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:40,130
and password instead it immediately took

242
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,140
you to a page with all my information it

243
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,260
said okay well here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your receipt you</font>

244

can print it out if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want and so</font>

245
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,780
they're gonna be thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why is</font>

246
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,840
there all this information available

247
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,420
without me having to type in I using

248
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,480
password and what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

249
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,209

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> urls of the links on this email and</font>

251
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,810
you can see on the first one and the

252
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,650
last one they're actually pretty similar

253
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I abbreviated the there's a random</font>

255
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,670
specifies my user account but we see

and the thing about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's no</font>

287
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,750
one company that's that has this problem

288
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,520
and you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as I go on but</font>

289
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously that's a big problem there's a</font>

290
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,640
lot of information here what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

291
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,710
do with this well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing that</font>

292
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,540
came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind is well if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have this</font>

293
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">much information on somebody you have a</font>

294
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,780
lot of background maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could try</font>

295
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,150
like a social engineering attack or

296
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,650
something like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where they</font>

297
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,270
were on a certain night maybe you could

298
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">call them up and say you are the hotel</font>

299
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,790
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some credibility because</font>

300
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:12,530
you could say oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your</font>

301
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,849
reservation number was this the last

302
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,670
four digits of your credit card number

303
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,320
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there was a problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

304
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,240
hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay and you need to send me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

305
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,060
check at this address or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

306
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,650
that but there's all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

307
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,640
problems one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that you see</font>

308
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,350
here the billing name and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guest they</font>

309
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,290
have they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different last names so</font>

310
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:35,180
maybe the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who reserved this hotel</font>

311
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,130
don't want anybody else to know that

312
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,920
they were in a room together at this

313
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,300
hotel so maybe there's another tactic

314
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,270
that the attacker could take in

315
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,920
blackmail or something like that at this

316
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,300
point you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know but somebody</font>

317
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,699
that was malicious could definitely look

318
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,880
into it and use this as as a starting

319
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:58,330
point to definitely go further alright

320
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,270
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you guys another example</font>

321
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,740
this one's in google calendar and so I

322
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,470
call it private events and calendar

323
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:10,730
tampering if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

324
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,760
Google Calendar it's very similar to

325
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,370
Outlook where you can create an event on

326
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,220
your calendar you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> share that event</font>

327
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,900
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friends and when they accept</font>

328
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,130
your invite it'll show on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your calendar</font>

329
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,740
that they accepted that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

330
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:29,180
be going so I sent myself in a bike and

331
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:34,040
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the links there it says are</font>

332
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going yes maybe no and I just put</font>

333
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,400
the links there so you can kind of see

334
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what I saw when I right click on it</font>

335
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,600
and click view URL and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I converted</font>

336
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,320
that into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarry to see what kind of</font>

337
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,320
results i would find

338
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,780
and we got a good number of results here

339
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,640
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be other people's</font>

340
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,579
calendars so the quarry ought to end up

341
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,800
using was site wwwdcom that's going to

342
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:05,320
limit the scope to just google com in

343
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:12,959
url calendar in url event in url action

344
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:16,090
and in url response updated alright so

345
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,400
one of the first links there meet with

346
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,020
brig and<font color="#CCCCCC"> penny at sacramento and you can</font>

347
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,930

349

374
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,439
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same problem if let's say you</font>

375
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,590
invite a friend to an event on google

376
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,720
calendar and their friend says hey I

377

378
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,330

379
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,610

383
00:16:54,150 --> 00:17:00,180
going to suck anyway it'll show up on

384
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">your calendar as the first person that</font>

385
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,780
you sent it to so there's a spoofing

386
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,130
issue there and I brought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

387
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,750
Google and they said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they're</font>

388
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:12,780
aware of it and the latest policy is

389
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:14,339
really strict on a vulnerability

390
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,209
disclosure I think it's like seven days

391
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,290
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that and I asked them</font>

392
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:21,600
about that and they said well that's

393
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">only for actively being exploited</font>

394
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,708
vulnerabilities and the thing about this

395
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,349
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how would anybody else know who's</font>

396
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,780
exploiting a google search besides

397
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:35,610
google so that's kind of that's kind of

398
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:38,790
a tricky if you ask me all right well

399
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:43,649
here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example cell phone</font>

400
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:48,510
carrier shipping confirmations this

401
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:49,740
one's pretty fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here's an</font>

402
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,629
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got just the other day and</font>

403
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:57,210
blocked out the important information

404
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:59,610
here so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just the email and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

405
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,740
is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if they in my email that</font>

406
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,090
they say you know here's your subtotal

here's your receipt information

408

confirmation all this stuff but it's

409
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,900
another thing when you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

410
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,490
information online you see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

428
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:55,049
they usually don't have that problem

429
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:56,879
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have in the past in this</font>

430
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:59,549
example they don't but we click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just pages and pages and pages of this</font>

464
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:25,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just this one example that I'm</font>

465
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,399
showing you right now

466
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,600
you can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the query a little bit</font>

467
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,460
and you get you'll get different results

468
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,320
so and also when you first do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

469
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,920
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have one result</font>

470
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,550
click here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more because it it thinks</font>

471
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,800
that they're too similar but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

472
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:54,010
numbers that it comes back with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a</font>

473
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:56,889
little bit weird but yeah the mechanism

474
00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:01,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">for caching from google I'll get into</font>

475
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that any other comments on this page</font>

476
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:09,720
right here everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else huh verizon</font>

477
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,040
all right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple examples</font>

478
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,639
that I didn't get into here just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

479
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,740
it's a little bit sketchy but there have

480
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">been pages with full credit card numbers</font>

481
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,890
and cvv details on the website that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

482
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,870
found and interesting thing about that

483
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:34,810
is is very illegal for companies to

484
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:36,879
store cvv numbers credit card limits

485
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,270
reward categories and points those ones

486
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">are all over the place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and personal</font>

487
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,430
identifiable information in the URL over

488
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTP that's that's another one that was</font>

489
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:55,030
seen pretty frequently so so the

490
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,860
interesting thing about this is it it's

491
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:03,639
not direct at any one industry it covers

492
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,250
pretty much all industries and you know

493
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,950
there doesn't seem to be a writer reason

494
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,230
between you know which sites has<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

495
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">warner ability or which sites do not it</font>

496
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just depends on who set up their email</font>

497
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:23,380
system and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's basically</font>

498
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:25,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why is this happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

499
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so a lot of it comes down to these</font>

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,140
personalized emails they want to send

501
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,420
you a personalized email they wanted to

502
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:35,380
have receipt information or an invoice

503
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:37,810
or a link so you can unsubscribe and all

504
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,130
the times the unsubscribe links if you

505
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,889
find that URL

506
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,990
tell you the person's email address

507
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,490
which would be pretty useful if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

508
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,560
in marketing or sales or something like

509
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:52,270
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you'd be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

510
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what emails one of your competitors is</font>

511
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,210
subscribed to or something like that

512
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,640
you'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send find out who they</font>

513
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,850
were and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own stuff more</font>

514
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,990
black hat stuff but one of the

515
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting things about is they use</font>

516
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,140
unique URLs for tracking the user

517
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,300
interaction and that's why there's URLs

518
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,890
all over these emails they also wanted

519
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty so that people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view these</font>

520
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,420
email so they load it up with pictures

521
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">and HTML but it has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support all email</font>

522
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,710
clients and that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

523
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,300
that breaks down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and follow the</font>

524
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,950
unsupported clients that's why they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

525
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,520
that link view this email in your

526
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:27,730
browser because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're running some</font>

527
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,590
weird email client they still want to be

528
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,090
able to sell to you or give whatever

529
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,500
information they want to give to you

530
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way and that's why they have these</font>

531
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,750
links and you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view it on the</font>

532
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,910
website another reason they do it is

533
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for convenience and recently there</font>

534
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,810
was a issue with okcupid com where I

535
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,790
guess that's a dating site and the

536
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,950
there's a blog<font color="#CCCCCC"> post about how the emails</font>

537
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they sent out automatically logged</font>

538
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,790
you in when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you clicked on them so if</font>

539
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,990
you forwarded that information to

540
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,460
somebody else or somebody else got

541
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,320
access to your email<font color="#CCCCCC"> account they could</font>

542
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> click the link and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

543
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">all your messages and your inbox and</font>

544
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,350
things like that and a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> dating</font>

545
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,690
website and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about we when when asked</font>

546
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,060
about it said yeah we built this feature

547
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,180
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people requested it it allows</font>

548
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:16,270
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more easeful and immediate user</font>

549
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,100
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess both of these</font>

550
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:21,040
sites decided to the exact same thing

551
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,629
and regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security costs and</font>

552
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,280
that's that's always the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you</font>

553
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,280
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance convenience with</font>

554
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:33,190
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where does that where do</font>

555
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to balance out all right so a</font>

556
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,210
little bit about solutions to this

557
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,890
problem and if the website has this

558
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,700
problem it's not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over there are a</font>

559
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,290
few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first if</font>

560
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,300
possible make sure you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

561
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,580
don't provide any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

562
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,149

566
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,300
them provide like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin number or some</font>

567
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,980
kind of information that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't just</font>

568
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:09,190
randomly find on the internet but if

569
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:11,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already too late you already have</font>

570
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,840
one of these websites on that you're

571
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,699
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for make sure that you</font>

572
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,459
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper housing so always</font>

573
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,220
use HTTPS on these sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

574
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,050
expire these pages quickly less than 30

575
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">days that way if Google finds these</font>

576
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,770
links they're not there for very long

577
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,809
you're limiting the exposure you're

578
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,820
limiting the risk there and then you

579
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:33,149
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add the headers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cache-control no</font>

580
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,580
cash no store and pragma no cache and

581
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:39,330
hopefully the most of the search engines

582
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,220
and everything else will honor these and

583
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,960
especially if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using HTTPS they</font>

584
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,850
won't actually keep the links with these

585
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,530
sites though drop them because they'll

586
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,178
understand that's supposed to be secure

587
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:53,410
and it's not supposed to be cached or

588
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:55,840
stored alternatively if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're admins</font>

589
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,120
don't have control in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

590
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the HTTP headers alternatively you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

591
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,809
just add meta tags within the page they

592
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,809
do effectively the same exact thing

593
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,390
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done is</font>

594
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,059
implement robots.txt allow these sites

595
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,850
they didn't have robots a txt properly

596
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:20,470
implemented and what that does is that

597
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:22,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">provides restrictions on what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

598
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,030
search engines are allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through</font>

599
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,410
on your website there's no law or

600
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,510
anything like that that says they have

601
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but most of the reputable</font>

602
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,410
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll follow it like if</font>

603
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,629
Google sees that you're disallowing all

604
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,070
the pages on your website it's just

605
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:41,580
going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then stop</font>

606
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:43,840
everything else exactly exactly but a

607
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,490
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i use google as</font>

608
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,230
an example but you can use bing or

609
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">DuckDuckGo or any other search engine</font>

610
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the same thing</font>

611
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">but google way is the biggest search</font>

612
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,929
engine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is going to give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

613
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,240
most results so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make sure</font>

614
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:58,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> limiting that as much as you</font>

615
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,710
can so like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish search</font>

616
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,960
engines<font color="#E5E5E5"> will honor this file but they're</font>

617
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">not required to less reputable scanners</font>

618
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,190
may just ignore it so there's no game

619
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,290
but you definitely want to have that in

620
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,520
there where if you have this problem and

621
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,990
people are saying hey what's my

622
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,270
information doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your website</font>

623
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:16,740
everybody to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to make sure</font>

624
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:18,150
move these pages from google so the

625
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,520
people responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your website they</font>

626
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,110
can use google webmaster tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

627
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,850
can submit a request to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paid</font>

628
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">rivet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do this for all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that have been leaked onto google</font>

630
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,170
somehow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also remove the google</font>

631
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">cache and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they say that if the page</font>

632
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,970
still exists use the robots.txt to

633
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,250
prevent<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from crawling it but even</font>

634
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,780
if the URL is disallowed they may still

635
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,180
index the page and listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the search</font>

636
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:47,550
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> because somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else linked to</font>

637
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:49,080
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so however if you submit a</font>

638
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,750
removal request that will honor that

639
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:57,750
over it and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll keep the page out</font>

640
00:27:51,750 --> 00:28:00,780
of search results and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there are</font>

641
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,340
some laws and consequences the one

642
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,379
that's probably the most damning is in

643
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,800
California there's a law that says that

644
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,900
organizations are must notify

645
