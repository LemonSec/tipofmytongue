1
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,290
what's good to be able to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back out</font>

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,940
to austin since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I graduate from</font>

00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,410
University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Texas in Austin the guys</font>

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,390
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they invite me to come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,820
to us now usually can say yes they can

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">work it but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really appreciate the role</font>

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,900
that last con place and bringing

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,030
together the right stakeholders in here

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,370
and as you've heard in the message we we

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,260
need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message out to not just</font>

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,910
developers and security professionals

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,160
but it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into the sea Suites</font>

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,860
of our organizations so part of our job

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,410
has been to get out to the non-security

15
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,760
forms as well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's</font>

16
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,620
the right place because you the guys who

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,010
fundamentally can make it a change here

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,930
what we do and most of you have a

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,099
fundamental appreciation of this and

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,590
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is National Cyber Security</font>

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,480
Awareness fun and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your perspective</font>

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,550
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just like this is the space</font>

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,210
that we play<font color="#E5E5E5"> in but we're trying to make</font>

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more everybody's life and</font>

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,289
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raising awareness there was</font>

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,630
discussions yesterday as we said one the

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,310
initiative who sponsor is stay safe

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,530
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're trying to reach down</font>

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,930
to children as well to help them get a

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,740
fundamental appreciation of it many of

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,080
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,500
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today really come from a</font>

33
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,810
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can be making a difference</font>

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,610
we should get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from this victim</font>

35
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,100
mentality that will software is putting

36
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,780
us at risk or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> products that we rely</font>

37
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,309
upon or putting us at risk because we

38
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,140
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something about it and</font>

39
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,700
you're in position to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

40
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,979
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that as well but part of</font>

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,200
it is based on working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumer</font>

42
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:48,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of the house as well now the focus</font>

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,649
here we the software supply chain

44
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:52,390
assurance programs are focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

45
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:53,920
enabling enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> of resilience</font>

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,959
through the programs that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have for</font>

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">Software Assurance supply chain risk</font>

48
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:02,470
management and ICT security automation

49
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,380
and we'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about those and how</font>

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,849
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> applicable now I mean a great</font>

51
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,169
role because i can say i'm actually

52
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:09,910
here's the government to help you

53
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,290
because we give away<font color="#CCCCCC"> things everything</font>

54
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,329
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be talking about are</font>

55
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,489
free to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you should be able to</font>

56
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:18,310
leverage these resources but what's more

57
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,230
importantly important in the role that

58
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,640
we play is in the public-private

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,560
collaboration because many of the things

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,390
are offered have actually been developed

61
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,220
through industry and they're offering up

62
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,010
their intellectual property for free for

63
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,510
others to use as well and I

64
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,370
encourage you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your role</font>

65
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,200
than how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be sharing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with others</font>

66
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,760
as well and it's it's a marketing

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,679
advantage because when people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a leading is a thought leader and</font>

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,189
helping people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it actually helps</font>

70
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,260
your company from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the profit side as</font>

71
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,569
well it helps your brand be able to do

72
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,470
that and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

73
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,000
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is through that</font>

74
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,230
public-private collaboration it's not

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,700
just do the department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of homeland</font>

76
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,980
security but we do this in conjunction

77
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,420
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department of Defense as well</font>

78
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,590
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of Commerce to the</font>

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,690
National Institute<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Standards and</font>

80
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,579
Technology we run quarterly working

81
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,470
groups and forums we'd invite<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

82
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,299
participate we normally have those in

83
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,329
the Washington DC area but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

84
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,620
more online as well organizationally is

85
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,480
mentioned I'm in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

86
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,159
cybersecurity and communications our

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,959
role is kind of interesting given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

88
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,370
fact that we've been tasked with

<font color="#E5E5E5">securing our nation's critical</font>

91
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,119
or operate so public-private

92
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,340
collaboration is very important to be

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,319
able to do that we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

94
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,629
actually organized in such a way that we

95
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,638
have an operational elements that deals

96
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,980
just on the communication side we have

97
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,500
the operational side that deals with the

98
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,929
cybersecurity side as well we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

99
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,910
on supporting the gov and calm side of

100
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,010
the house and our stakeholder engagement

101
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,299
is reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to those for those of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you are not for me with critical</font>

103
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,739
infrastructure it's basically anything

104
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:49,109
that we as citizens rely upon to do our

105
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,919
everyday lives it runs from<font color="#E5E5E5"> power energy</font>

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,959
production to banking and finance

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,859
telecommunications that we've got and we

108

provide 24<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 7 operational support to</font>

109
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,190
those organizations and the foot stomper

110

to this to you is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are</font>

that's not really what we're about but

121
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,380
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> was individuals feel and you</font>

address the problems that they're having

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
given the changing nature of the cyber

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those standards that we've</font>

got that actually enable the tooling and

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we're managing the activities</font>

for software in supply chain management

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,920
number one we enable automation and I'll

150
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last part of</font>

152
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,219
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage those security</font>

automation standards and you've actually

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,750
heard some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things here like</font>

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,270
little terms like CDE cwe go what's that

156
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,340
some of you may know we spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

157
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,710
effort on actually supporting

158

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,090
terms of supporting our us-cert but

160
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,740
supporting guys who do contracting how

161
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,049
do you do that so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping with</font>

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that area we're helping in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">area of outreach and collaboration we</font>

164
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,930
provide a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of publications material</font>

165
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,670
that goes out we provide free training

166
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,320
some of the training<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only offer on</font>

167
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,690
the dot gov site through our federal

168
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,849
virtual training environment but some of

169
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,980
its through our workshops that we we

170
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,230
offer as well we spent a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

171
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,610
effort also in influencing standards and

<font color="#E5E5E5">particular international standards</font>

173
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,600
because it is a global economy<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also</font>

174
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,799
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with NIST in developing rolling</font>

175
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,730
outs on the standards I want to talk

176
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">about some of those that are</font>

177
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,700
particularly important to what we're

178
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing here you ought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be from you with</font>

179
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,680
the new ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come out and we</font>

180
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,200
also influence policy now why is that

181
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,340
important because we've actually been

182
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,599
doing this for a number of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

183
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,909
we've been putting things out there for

184
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,500
voluntary adoption I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you</font>

185
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,370
voluntary adoption is not working so

186
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,220
well and but but you notice i keyed on

187
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,230
policy our job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to go out their</font>

188
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,060
influence changes in the legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

189
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,550
get very<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned when people say hey</font>

190
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,190
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need new laws to help do</font>

191
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,620
this space certainly laws are one way to

192
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,210
motivate change but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you when</font>

193
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,010
you start engaging Congress when you ask

194
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,729
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> help in that area get a lot of</font>

195
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,099
unintended

196
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:57,628
consequences and it's much better that

197
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:59,069
we as organizations both when the

198
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,229
federal government and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state level</font>

199
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,809
but also in companies if you develop

200
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,938
policies that put in place it says we

201
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:07,319
are exercising both do care and due

202
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:08,639
diligence and what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

203
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,529
the area Software Assurance and supply

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,259
chain risk management that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is far better</font>

205
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:15,360
than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say let's wait for a lot</font>

206
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,389
of you put in place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why we</font>

207
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend that effort to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that and when we</font>

208
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,020
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the critical infrastructure</font>

209
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:23,639
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people think of the physical</font>

210
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,799
infrastructure if you're in this room

211
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamentally understand that our</font>

212
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,599
critical infrastructure today is both

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,580
enabled and controlled by the software

214
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ICT components that are out</font>

215
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,020
there the challenge space that we find

216
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,849
is that software represents a high risk

217
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,710
of every one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

218
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,909
take out a critical infrastructure you

219
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,099
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your software that's</font>

220
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:46,649
running that if you want to even take a

221
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,449
look at the products that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in there</font>

222
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:51,120
and the challenge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're having and</font>

223
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,409
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunate reality that</font>

224
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,149
we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of counterfeit</font>

00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,430
switches and routers even your servers

228
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,529
you've got counterfeit components in

229
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,669
there that you know yesterday well this

230
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:04,409
morning when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you heard you know let's</font>

231
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,599
envision what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

232
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:07,800
close your eyes told Robert but one

233
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,120
thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have added after you've</font>

234
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,069
gone through all this complexity you

235
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,770
know closing your eyes now think of all

236
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:17,279
of this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's built on counterfeit</font>

237
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,378
and tainted components now that's a

238
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:23,069
nightmare<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's the reality of</font>

239
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:25,589
where we're at and so we focus on the

240
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,139
idea that says we understand the

241
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,209
realities of physical and cyber coming

242
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,830
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're having but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

243
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,479
recognition of that it's multiple

244
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,149
disciplines as well it's no longer just

245
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,459
about safety and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just security</font>

246
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,279
in fact safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> and security a Robert</font>

247
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,169
shared that<font color="#E5E5E5"> example with you 911 perhaps</font>

248
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,449
the most defining event newest history

249
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,839
is a classic example or systems that

250
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:50,609
have been designed built and deployed to

251
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,980
be safe that because they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

252
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,980
designed built and deployed to be secure

253
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,720
hundreds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people died and I asked to</font>

254
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,310
save you guys about that so how what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

255
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they said well you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

256
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,920
security issues we I said wait a minute

257
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:07,230
hundreds of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> died how's that safe</font>

258
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,939
and they just kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of go blank it</font>

259
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,800
but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more and we heard examples</font>

260
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,560
from other presentations here about an

261
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,939
hour medical devices that well there's

262
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're supposedly safe but they're not</font>

263
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,380
secure we know in today's environment

264
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,700
that if products are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

265
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,380
fundamentally they're not safe because

266
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be exploited to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

267
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that security is</font>

268
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,699
hard really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes more from a mindset of</font>

269
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that we've been doing security</font>

270
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,420
we've been doing security<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

afterthought try to bolt it on and all

272
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden the security guys get viewed</font>

273
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,090
as obstructionist how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you been</font>

274
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">told hey you're slowing stuff down well</font>

275
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,530
if you had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to come in there</font>

276
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,780
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> front to help architect and design</font>

277
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solutions and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even design test</font>

278
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,760
cases as you're building it when you get

279
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the point of deployment not only can</font>

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you deploy it a lot faster because</font>

281
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,949
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressing security as an</font>

282
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,560
afterthought<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually more</font>

283
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,980
resilient in fact it's been demonstrated

284
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,510
that built-in security actually enables

285
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,550
resiliency and actually more agility if

286
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,280
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> building fundamentally resilient</font>

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,170
so much faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you can count on</font>

289
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,150
the individual component but because we

can't count on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those we later on you</font>

know firewalls damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> z's we got all this</font>

292
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,790
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now makes security to look</font>

293
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,260
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard but it gets in the way of</font>

294
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,020
doing business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a challenge</font>

295
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we we also know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,250
bring this up because we've got new

299
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,110
standards that come out in there that

303
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,040
security controls out there and you

304
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,870
can't just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll apply them all it</font>

305
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,010
has to be aligned with your mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

306

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and you have to make sure</font>

doing a lot area of automated continuous

314
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:11,359
you've interfaced with others you're now

315
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:14,099
put at risk we've got numerous stories

316
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,870
some that we can share where we've had

317
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,510
critical infrastructure literally shut

318
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,670
down the entire plant was shut down

319
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,770
simply because they were interconnected

320
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,130
with their suppliers who got breached

321
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,360
their suppliers got owned by somebody

322
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sudden they got Malware</font>

323
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,040
coming in to their plant facilities and

324
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been a fundamental problem</font>

325
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,730
for us because how do you trust your

326
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,200
suppliers now because that's the nature

327
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,240
of doing business we are interconnected

328
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,340
with them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody says that we've</font>

329
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,870
got security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place why is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

330
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,090
we're still being breezed we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

firewall well the problem is is that

333
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,520
they're getting through the soft

334
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,350
underbelly over an enterprise you've

335
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,420
heard numerous talks where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

338
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,970
that's enabled one of the ways is

339
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,610

349
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,599
also we started the effort with the

common weakness enumeration because<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVEs</font>

we're now up to 64,000 publicly reported

vulnerabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> for which there's</font>

353
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,610

354
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:37,680
900 root causes and that's the common

355
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,120
weakness enumeration and two-thirds of

356
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,370
them are at the code level we can

357
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,840
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect these through static</font>

358

code analysis the tools are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

359
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,710
about doing that now the others are

360
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,940
obviously at the design level but the

361
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,320
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we actually understand these</font>

362
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,750
before we operationally deployed the

363
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,070
stuff SI VES are discovered after you've

364
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,930
deployed it and somebody's already been

365
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:02,910
breached why do we care it's because as

366
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,540
long as you have these common weaknesses

367
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,370
in your systems in your network it's not

368
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">a matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of when</font>

369
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,720
will you be a victim of a zero-day

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,880
attack these<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent your attack</font>

371
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,340
vectors it's almost entertaining when

372
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,439
you hear almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a weekly basis</font>

373
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,300
somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has become a victim of a</font>

374
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,530
zero-day attack well that's like

375
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
standing up in public and saying

376
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,579
somebody else was more committed to than

377
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,769
us and finding our exploitable

378
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,259
weaknesses than we were

379
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,910
because guess what these are yours you

380
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:33,319
know what you you operation I deployed

381
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,660
these these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> yours and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a</font>

382
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:37,488
hundred percent discoverable but do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

383
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,529
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and discover</font>

384
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:42,050
those and do something about it now when

385
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,910
we address Software Assurance understand

386
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,729
we thought we look at the exploitable

387
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,069
nature of software and certainly many

388
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,589
people will say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisa most of these</font>

389
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,569
are just common defects which for the

390
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,369
most part that's true but trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

391
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:57,920
develop one hundred percent defect free

392
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:59,649
code is not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and and</font>

393
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,748
there is a high correlation between

394
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:05,329
reliability defects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

395
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:07,160
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have so going after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

396
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,868
one thing so the common weaknesses are

397
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,238
looking at those exploitable things that

398
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:12,559
are unintentional vulnerabilities they

399
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:15,319
didn't necessarily know they didn't have

400
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,329
malicious intent but also malware now a

401
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:19,819
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people think of malware as being</font>

402
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:22,939
only an operational issue the challenge

403
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:25,488
we have is that more and more we're

404
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:26,839
finding out that there's software<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

405
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:30,019
delivered to us that has malware

406
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,259
pre-installed now does that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that</font>

407
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:35,149
the developers had malicious intent a

408
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:37,220
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times it's probably I would like</font>

409
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank is more attributable to sloppy</font>

410
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,269
manufacturing hygiene they<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply were</font>

411
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,769
unaware of the fact that the module that

412
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:44,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">they pull down which had really great</font>

413
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,040
functionality it could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in a</font>

414
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,459
public library could have been an open

415
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,899
library are a proprietary library but

416
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,790
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they pulled it down they didn't</font>

417
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:56,509
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> check to see either one does it</font>

418
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,849
have exploitable weaknesses does it have

419
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,410
known publicly reported vulnerabilities

420
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,029
or does it have malware they just pull

421
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,480
it down they use it they<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it into new</font>

422
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:08,779
software and rolls out and and that's

423
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,459
somewhat problematic for us and but

424
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">again we're finding out because it's out</font>

425
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,209
there so much and developers are just

426
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,999
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make things work they're doing</font>

427
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and so this comes down to</font>

428
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,199
understanding where is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that we can</font>

429
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something about it it's what</font>

430
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,410

beyond the product when building block

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,460
there they're all bought and sold the

459

moving and more and more to services my

463
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,420
concern is we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really thinking</font>

much about software<font color="#E5E5E5"> security when we</font>

465
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,160
were actually buying software what's the

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,750
likelihood people are going to be asking

467
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,110
questions about software security when

468
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,640
you're buying services not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,710
taken our hands off the steering wheel

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,180
we've taken our eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the road we</font>

471
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,710
just kind of fundamentally let everybody

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,989

474
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,790
an issue it is a software that's running

475
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,530
our enterprises today but this is all

<font color="#E5E5E5">about risk management because you're</font>

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,780
that there are people involved in the

way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not to say faurence</font>

487
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,060
developed software is bad it's simply

488
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,890
saying if you don't know who's involved

489
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,200
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing software somebody is</font>

490
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,840
making risk decisions for you and you're

491
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really sure of their intent or in</font>

most cases their capability to

developing secure products and services

494
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,920
but reuse is one of those things up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

495
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,379
top there that actually has always been

496
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,390
viewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a great system</font>

497
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,010
software engineering practice the

498
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,400
challenge of what we have especially

499
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,870
from a security perspective is that

500
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,030
reuse brings with it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unintended</font>

501
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,699

502
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,649
software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was developed years ago it</font>

503
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,890
worked fine but it was on different

504
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,590
platforms it was interfacing with other

505
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">applications and oh by the way it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

506
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,679
not have been developed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the web</font>

507
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,470
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> its web facing so reuse needs to be</font>

508
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,840
as evaluated for fit fitness for use for

509
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new environment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

510
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,899
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in the area of risk management</font>

511
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,910
is that because everybody does risk

512
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,950
management it's very contextual for at

513
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,650
the enterprise level we manage risk

514
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,090
based on a the regulatory compliance of

00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">changing threat environment we have to</font>

516
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,280
make a business case even when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

517
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,630
fully understand our know that we can't

518
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,310
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for everything we make trade-offs</font>

519
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,650
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine if you're making it</font>

520
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:49,780
informed about that the challenge space

521
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,610
is that we turn to programs or projects

522
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,500
to deliver these capabilities that could

523

be internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed programs of</font>

projects it could be acquisition team or

<font color="#CCCCCC">we've we turn to somebody to do this at</font>

526
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,010
that program or project level we treat

527
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,189
risk at cost schedule and performance

528
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,600
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that performance should</font>

what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your statement of work if you</font>

question who's making risk decisions for

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,700
us you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think well if you're</font>

the purchasing organization you're

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,650
making a risk decision well that's just

542
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the supplier the risk aren't really</font>

543
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,340
theirs they're only looking at cost

544
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,930
schedule and performance they're not

545
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,659
looking at this is fundamentally going

546
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,610
to put my customer at risk that's the

547
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,990
using organization but there's a using

548

organization get to make these risk

549
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,830
decisions now you've turned to somebody

550
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,320
else to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for you all of these</font>

what I view as legal trade and within

00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,310
that legal trade space we understand the

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,690
are all xml-based so that if you're a

720
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,440
tool vendor you can have easy output for

both production of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conforming format</font>

counterfeits in particular industry says

725
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,959
you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of that you just need</font>

726
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,840
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you buy authentic</font>

727
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,490
components so buy from the OEMs the

728
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,340
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment manufacturer</font>

729
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,420
component manufacturer and that will

730
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,389
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

731
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:17,420
counterfeits that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good and for</font>

732
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most part that's true because like I</font>

733
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,230
said no like Cisco routers and switches

734
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,490
are known to be counterfeit a lot so you

735
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be making sure that you're buying</font>

736
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,750
authentic ones the challenge thing that

737
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,040
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is that both authentic and</font>

738
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,390
counterfeit products can be defective

739
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,820
and more importantly you should

740
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:35,220
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> both counterfeits and</font>

741
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:37,230
authentic products can be tainted

742
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,270
so just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that it's authentic</font>

743
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,820
does not mean that does not have malware

744
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,340
in it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mean that doesn't have</font>

745
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:47,070
exploitable weaknesses and so we

746
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,870
actually are enabling a more scalable

747
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,039
means for detection and reporting now

748
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,129
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the standards</font>

standards i already mentioned for the

751
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,490
software and in the supply chain the

752
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,350
reason we've launched that one is it's

753
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,750
to articulate information about

754
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,209
authenticity or if it's counterfeit or

755
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,950
defective to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and we</font>

756
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,140
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common attack patterns</font>

757
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,120
that go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to understand how</font>

might that do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment attack patterns</font>

759
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,949
look at how software can be exploited so

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,350
you check for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resiliency of your</font>

engineering attacks and it also has

764
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,809
supply chain attacks in there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

765
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,879
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of getting the word out about</font>

that as well the last issue that we

of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of penetration testing</font>

940
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,380
is only something you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do in</font>

941
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,929
an operational setting but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

942
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,030
you know the operational deployment of

it's going to be interfacing with so you

can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing penetration</font>

testing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> development environment</font>

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very revealing because</font>

949
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,049
unlike static code analysis you can

950
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start discovering some</font>

951
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,250
architectural design flaws in your

952
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,690
software by doing that six-year coding

953
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,549
is a pocket guide that talks about

954
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,110
preparing to write secure software some

955
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:02,330
of those coding principles and practices

956
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,280
all the way down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to avoid and</font>

957
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,290
again keep questions ask your developers

958
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,020
one of my favorite questions that I like

959
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:10,969
to ask developers is are any compiler

960
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,879
warning disabled for the code being

961
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:16,158
delivered and most of the time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

962
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,440
you don't care about that yes we do

963
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,760
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all about security and</font>

964
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,639
it's all about risk being passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

965
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,869
not yours so tell me explain to me why

966
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,730
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of those compiler</font>

967
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,679
warnings were<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to disable and why</font>

968
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,639
they don't affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and I'll bet you</font>

969
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">most you can never have that</font>

970
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,830
conversation if you're on the

971
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,570
development side have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

972
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,899
discussion with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your program management</font>

973
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,369
or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your user explain to them</font>

974
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:39,799
why those compiler warnings weren't

975
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,859
valid are important of a consideration

976
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user key practice is mitigating</font>

are most critical to what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

981
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,350
but what was most important and by the

982
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,080
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is based on our top 25 common</font>

984
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,430
identify the top 25<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has the</font>

mitigation practices that go with it but

986
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,540
it also has the attack patterns that are

associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the given common</font>

989
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,390
component I realize you can't read it

990
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,730
but in that the table that shows that

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your test regime</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">look for and so we recognize the fact</font>

1014
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,350
that everybody has to go through plan

1015
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,090
design build and deploy and we certainly

1016
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand that they have requirements</font>

to know

1055
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,419
and it goes through secure design but

1056
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk-based test plans code review static</font>

1057
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,810
and dynamic code analysis now yes you

1058
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,280
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this manually but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">tell you this is one of the spaces that</font>

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools make a difference i'm not going to</font>

1061
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,109
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tools are the be-all and</font>

1062
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,900
end-all in fact there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no goober tool</font>

1063
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,150
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> created equal but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

1064
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to start and do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this without using some</font>

1065
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,780
form of static code analysis is

1066
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,880
virtually impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

1067
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,380
there's simple examples and i'm sure

1068
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,890
you've given this to some of your coders

1069
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,450
and say hey programmer here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 lines</font>

1070
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,520
of code and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's an exploitable</font>

1071
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,500
construct within that 25 lines would

1072
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
like you to find it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fix it you</font>

1073
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,270
realize that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> programmers can't find</font>

1074
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,010
it so if they can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it 25 lines of</font>

1075
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,619
code how can they do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 thousand</font>

1076
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,480
lines of code so tools actually are

1077
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,340
pretty good about finding those and and

1078
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,350
again we've been working with the tool

1079
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,270
vendors in the space who use the cwe as

1080
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,220
a way of reporting that out not only do

1081
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,440
they identify it that when it's tagged

1082
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,330
they also give you the mitigation

1083
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,000
practices of saying this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you fix</font>

1084
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:35,520
them and so it's got much better in that

1085
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,050
space and the challenge is is that

1086
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,270
sometimes the consumers don't appreciate

1087
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and I'll blame start with the</font>

1088
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,420
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked some</font>

1089
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,160
government suppliers tell me which<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font>

1090
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you do you use and I remember setting</font>

1091
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,220
down as a luncheon like this a table

1092
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,049
with a guy and I said so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you</font>

1093
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,640
using said well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we actually</font>

1094
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,680
proposed using this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

1095
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,690
static code analyzer on there but the

1096
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,220
government acquisition program manager

1097
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,390
said that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an unnecessary</font>

1098
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,740
overhead so what's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean he said my</font>

1099
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,859
company said we didn't get to use any

1100
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,819
tools I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so in other words the</font>

1101
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,619
guy who doesn't know anything about

1102
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">software who doesn't touch soft just</font>

1103
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:11,310
disabled what the supplier was trying to

1104
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,859
do is the right thing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1105
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:15,060
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work together</font>

1106
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:16,500
static code analyzer should just be a

1107
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,700
normal way of doing business there

1108
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,040
shouldn't be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

1109
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,770
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I mentioned using pen</font>

1110
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,529
testing as part of that but also library

1111
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,150
updates as patches are rolled out you

1112
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,590
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update the</font>

1113
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:32,430
libraries where this came from so you

00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:34,530
don't redeploy that same thing so all of

we should start seeing on stand up on

1188
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,960
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to end on the part of where I</font>

1189
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,419
think security automation is because

1190
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,920
everybody understands we've got some

1191
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,720
challenges here even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

1192
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,790
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this I already mentioned the</font>

1193
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,490
value of static code analysis is one of

1194
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,500
those but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the standards</font>

1195
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,870
but that's just one piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this puzzle</font>

1196
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,520
and automation is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1197
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,109
helps us here and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

1198
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact is that our</font>

1199
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:28,240
cyber threats have emerged over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1200
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,220
just that they've emerged but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack</font>

1202
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,640
again you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this audience you</font>

1203
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,830
fundamentally understand that it's it's

1204
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,170
hard to defend against all that but we

1205
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:40,299
also know that industry has been very

1206
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,510
responsive to this we have tools and

1207
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">services fact some of you or some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1208
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:47,770
these guys but many of you use others

1209
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,510
you recognize these and they're all

1210
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:52,060
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ordinance so the solutions</font>

1211
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:55,810
have emerged over time and it's pretty

1212
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">overwhelming and you can say well it's</font>

1213
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:00,970
it's all very necessary but is it

1214
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,890
sufficient how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what kind</font>

1215
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,910
of coverage do you have so if you or

1216
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tactical way of just saying</font>

1217
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,310
systems engineering how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1218
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,950
re-engineered this in the first place

1219
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:13,900
and is to go back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what we</font>

1220
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,750
have in common<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were to</font>

1221
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,250
architect security with information

1222
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,480
standards for our communities of

1223
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,260
interest we know that everybody has to

1224
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,090
do vulnerability management

1225
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,100
configuration management threat

1226
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,050
management asset management intrusion

1227
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,330
detection system development and

1228
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,050
incident management change management

1229
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:33,610
all the way down to centralize reporting

1230
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,190
we recognize that everybody has to do

1231
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,920
that so let's stand back and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1232
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,690
here's here's our problem space there

1233
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,610
are tools that support all these things

1234
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we know that how do you</font>

1235
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the enterprises that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1236
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to support because everybody has</font>

1237
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:52,180
things in common like web servers app

1238
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:54,279
servers mail servers desktop systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1239
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,020
servers we have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these in common</font>

1240
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have solutions that address</font>

1241
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,280
different pieces of that and so we

1242
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,660
recognize that and now

1243
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,600
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed it's been sprinkled with</font>

1244
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,339
a lot of alphabet soup here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1245
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we have on our security automation</font>

1246
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,610
standards my intent is not to go over

1247
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,280
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like a full day</font>

1248
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,320
tutorial in itself but to point you to

1249
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,690
where the resources are and why you

1250
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,340
ought to pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these because</font>

1251
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,620
it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your space where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

1252
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,800
at for instance if you're in the area of

1253
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,410
vulnerability analysis then things like

1254
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">cve cwe those those are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important to</font>

1255
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,160
using common attack patterns using oval

00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,140
using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> script scanning your networks</font>

1257
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,210
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these are all</font>

1258
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,950
parts of what we have today is s cap the

1259
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,350
security content automation protocol

1260
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,939
which deals with vulnerability analysis

1261
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,069
configuration guidance as well as now

1262
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,150
asset inventory within the federal

1263
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:44,770
government you're going to hear more

1264
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,230
about continuous diagnostics and

1265
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:49,720
mitigation that's that space that's all

1266
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,240
about mitigating the risk exposure we

1267
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,640
spend our time all up front there on the

1268
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,589
supply chain risk and the Software

1269
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,410
Assurance side so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that</font>

1270
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:01,200
before it even gets deployed we also

1271
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a huge effort that deals with</font>

1272
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,230
responding to the security and threat in

fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we place more of our</font>

1274
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,090
money today because so much bad is

1275
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,250
happening that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to do that</font>

1276
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,930
from threat analysis intrusion detection

1277
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,700
incident management but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

1278
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,859

1279
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,600

effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> on mitigating that risk before</font>

its operational deployed otherwise we

1282
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">just spend all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this effort over here</font>

1283
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,320
there's your secret decoder ring for

1284
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:31,390
each of the standards that we have that

1285
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,460
these now have been recognized by itu-t

1286

that constantly leave and reconnect to

1340
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,119
different than if you are in a voting

1341
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:41,740
and it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even different than if</font>

1342
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,660
you're supporting the intelligence

1343
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,180

1344
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,920
mission as well as the technologies that

1345

<font color="#CCCCCC">you deployed we're developing those</font>

vignettes you can go online to that we

already have 22 of the vignettes but

1348
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,930
we're developing others as well so the

1349
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,399
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important is you want to</font>

1352
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,880
