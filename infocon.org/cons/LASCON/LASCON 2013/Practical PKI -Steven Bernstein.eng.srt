1
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,540
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see up there you can see</font>

2
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,430
my little handle is sciatic nerd on

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter this way and I've made sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:30,040
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same silly profile picture so</font>

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,869
that you can find me no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,739
look you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be like oh it's that guy</font>

7
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:37,989
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so meanwhile what are we here</font>

8
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:40,089
to do today we're here to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Oh</font>

9
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,220
a lot it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like because that's a</font>

10
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,670
really busy slide but I want you to

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,890
understand something we're here together

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,020
we're in this together we're only going

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,969
to go so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> today but I want to cover</font>

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,670
by analogy some of the things you may or

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,200
may not have ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> come across at pki</font>

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,789
because let's face it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting the beginning to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation</font>

18
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,930
down this is a foundational talk if

19
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,699
you're just frothing at the mouth to

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,039
bring some crypto knowledge with you I

21
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,590
appreciate you very very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

22
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,780
likely to glaze over like a ham during

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,180
the holidays it's just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font>

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,920
all that well the reason I mention all

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,440
this is then I come from a keyboard that

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,259
won't respond there it goes I come from

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,800
a background that is media-centric I

28
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:28,660
talk too much I get nervous I like to

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,670
make jokes and voices and do silly

30
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,140
things because I'm up here on a suit

31
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,179
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> impress all of you and</font>

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,590
everyone I've actually walked up to and

33
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:41,800
said today they said relax three deep

34
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,560
breaths and then why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dressed in</font>

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">a suit it's last call relax this is a</font>

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,950
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your peers these people who are</font>

37
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to at least listen to you for at</font>

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,130
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes before they start</font>

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,869
digging deeply into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter but that's</font>

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what we have here is a</font>

41
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">background that suggests I've been in</font>

42
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,429
this industry for 11 years I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out</font>

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,380
as a filmmaker I was that kid who hung

44
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:04,119
out in the AV room hiding from the rest

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the world when i was 7 in seventh</font>

46
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:10,630
grade and beyond and then somehow along

47
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,790
the way information security<font color="#E5E5E5"> became the</font>

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,280
call it wasn't something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i originally</font>

49
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,470
intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into but there it is but</font>

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,629
my background now is I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

51
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">this with pki working with pki for well</font>

52
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,820
gosh it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11</font>

53
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,740
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a registration authority</font>

54
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,630
for nine and a half of those so the

55
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,000
scarring is permanent but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

56
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,570
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of myself as a</font>

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,610
cross between Shatner and kelsey grammer

58
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,140
when it comes together which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why I've</font>

59
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,180
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up there kind of crossed up in</font>

60
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,640
a Star Trek kind of reference because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

61
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,460
know i'm a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big nerd I mean a big nerd</font>

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,690
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because once I've talked</font>

63
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,160
you through it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few minutes and you</font>

64
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,079
start to nod off from the awesome lunch

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,000
they provided us here you'll see that

66
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,520
there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be afraid of with all</font>

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,790
the talking that I do this presentation

68
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,310
is to help explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people who have</font>

69
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,829
maybe not worked as much with this

70
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,450
technology what it actually does a lot

71
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,360
of folks have approached me in the past

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,640
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've overheard at other conferences</font>

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,340
you know what how dare this person come

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,040
and speak to us about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki we know pki</font>

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,870
and then all the talks begin with n

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,280
sub-1 sub-2 math and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to do</font>

77
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,230
that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chew the</font>

78
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,930
microphone and yell at you a little but

79
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,940
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to share for people</font>

80
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,190
who are non majors those who want to

81
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,510
understand how these pieces move back

82
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,820
and forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from an awesome</font>

83
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenStack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't you go to</font>

84
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that OpenStack presentation it was</font>

85
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually really awesome because I was</font>

86
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,440
not sure what they were going to cover

87
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:45,800
and they were suddenly talking all about

88
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,680
key management remotes automated key

89
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,510
management which actually directly comes

90
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,660
up in the talk i'm about to share with

91
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,100
you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like to reference XKCD</font>

92
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,440
wherever possible because there are

93
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,019
certain times the comics that they come

94
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,480
up that the folks at XKCD come up with

95
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,850
are just so perfect if you've ever had

96
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,290
to support anyone else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't help</font>

97
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:12,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">but want to share these things with you</font>

98
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:13,730
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right on with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show but wait we</font>

99
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,620
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki as a very good friend</font>

100
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,349
originally shared with me as<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font>

101
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,600
dragging me through learning cissp

102
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,430
cryptography material and he did this

103
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,160
awesome representation of cryptography

104
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:29,060
using a big padlock and a tennis<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball</font>

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,940
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay but how do i understand</font>

106
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,830
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really for we all know</font>

107
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,680
crypto sure we do we know it's a big fat

108
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,750
word we know it makes

109
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,330
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money keeps us fed keeps our</font>

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,979
kids in clothes and maybe even helps us

111
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,409
learn and understand new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

112
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,699
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> drives us but maybe we want</font>

113
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know a little bit of a different way</font>

114
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,060
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works from the beginners</font>

115
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,090
point of view because that's who this is

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,560
for and apologies to those who came up

117
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,049
with those awesome references for

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,710
explaining deep crypto things we're

119
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very brief</font>

120
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,280
simplified version if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will if you'll</font>

121
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,650
accept it of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pique i brokered</font>

122
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,380
authentication so basically forget all

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,049
the other bits in the passing of moduli

124
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,229
and other pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information let's</font>

125
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,539
pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to presentation</font>

126
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,800
examination chaining or looking to see

127
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:22,349
what route it's supported by and

128

validation or revocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking so</font>

check the out bro is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me let me</font>

130
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,409

right person for this job or at least

the right entity to represent this

133
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,110
organization and have you actually been

134
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,510
validated are you supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be here so</font>

135
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,849
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quick dirty right there so so</font>

136
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">far I breezed through it because again</font>

137
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:45,539
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about trying to understand how</font>

138
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pieces work together which now</font>

139
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:52,110
requires we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a brief moment of</font>

authentication versus authorization who

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,520
here already gets this completely raise

144
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,940
least throw a couple more hands cool

145
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,530
thank you I do appreciate that so

146
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,030
authentication being the part that

147
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,559
actually describes that we are who we

148
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,409
say we are or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least we're attempting</font>

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,310
to assert that we want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

150
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:15,300
the individual presenting or the entity

151
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,120
presenting some kind of credential

152
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,560
actually is who they say they are pretty

153
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward right so I came to</font>

154
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,060
realize I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how many Brazilians</font>

155
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,190
of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this that the pin is</font>

156
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,310
actually on a token if you've ever used

157
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,320
a smart card in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to challenge</font>

158
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,000
the holder of the token it's not to

159
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,560
protect your date it's to make sure that

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,940
theoretically it's the something you

161
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that something you know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

162
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,990
using those

163
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,220
factors to check your own head you want

164
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,780
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're actually the</font>

165
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,670
person who's holding that card there for

166
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,340
you use it but once I'm in the door

167
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:52,680
because that's what the authentication

168
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,960
generally grants access to the building

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,480
let's say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fictitious building</font>

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,000
by the way not anything specific it's

171
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,520
the idea that you get inside using the

172
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,400
smart card and you said aha I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

173
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,380
presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> my electronic identity this</font>

174
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,659
building just as easily be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole host</font>

175
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,390
of websites using a single sign-on

176
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,810
method let's say you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using Google's</font>

177
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,360
often google or help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out here what</font>

178
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,830
were the other large systems of single

179
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,910
sign-on methods that are out there what

180
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,320
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have we have when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is live ID</font>

181
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,300
you've got doesn't facebook now use a

182
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,969
standardized<font color="#E5E5E5"> one who's open ID isn't it</font>

183
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,120
and others so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all the same idea</font>

184
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,110
you're inside the system so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

185
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
allowed to do well that's your

186
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,490
authorization right so it describes what

187
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,190
the authenticated individual or entity

188
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,100
is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do them whatever presented</font>

189
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,260
that information of those credentials

190
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,080
now gets to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Holy</font>

191
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Grail in this area is some kind of on</font>

192
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fly provision the idea that what are</font>

193
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,580
you allowed to do well say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font>

194
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,070
company a and I'm trapped inside my

195
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,659
little silo over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and someone has a</font>

196
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,159
piece of information and they're in

197
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">another country but they have the</font>

198
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,570
database you need access to so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

199
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,429
being that without having to call

200
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,469
someone up<font color="#CCCCCC"> worried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what time it is</font>

201
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,670
go through a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paperwork try to</font>

202
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,470
argue between your boss that it's

203
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,540
important you do it do I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly</font>

204
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,800
somewhere a drive somewhere blah blah

205
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:22,010
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say oh we trust</font>

206
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,600
the credentials that came from company a

207
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,810
what a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what a fantastic</font>

208
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,000
concept what a colossal pain in the neck

209
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,860
but this is where it's all headed with

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,390
federated credentials another way of

211
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,060
saying this kind of that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

212
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,640
role-based it's a back-end attribute

213
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,978
exchange which sounds a little odd when

214
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think about back-end attribute</font>

215
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,800
exchange so it's just passing it back

216
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,740
and forth and if you went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

217
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,290
presentation earlier about OpenStack

218
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,970
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> barbican</font>

219
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,189
it's an automated solution that's being

220
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,440
built for the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help protect keys</font>

221
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,540
and automate the passing of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

222
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,100
here to there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

223
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,649
trust but we're getting ahead of

224
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,720
ourselves or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the baboon holding</font>

225
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,720
the microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM so on with the show</font>

226
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,349
certificates don't like autographs so a

227
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,529
photo of your favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> actor or actors</font>

228
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,420
is useless or meaningless or has little

229
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,579
value other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a photo of a</font>

230
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,139
person whose work to appreciate unless

231
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,029
they've signed it and you can prove they

232
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,130
have signed it another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of</font>

233
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,199
it of course still is if you went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

234
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,209
university saw what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Diploma looked</font>

235
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,670
like went home used Photoshop or print

236
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,109
shop for that matter and went ahead and

237
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,670
printed yourself one and signed it off

238
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,819
you could say you were a doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

239
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:45,180
physics except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not worth</font>

240
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:47,550
anything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all matters who signs it</font>

241
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,800
because we trust supposedly the entity

242
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that signed it welcome to the</font>

243
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,430
certificate authority or the

244
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,258
certification<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority so if the</font>

245
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,779
provost and the president or the people

246
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">who are appointed at that level have the</font>

247
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,699
authority to sign off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make that</font>

248
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,980
sheet of paper mean more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

249
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:07,109
sheet of paper then that's who we're

250
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,790
trusting replacing our ability to

251
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,620
believe that this came from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

252
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,319
source based on that signature and

253
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,089
that's what a CA does a request is

254
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:17,610
presented to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certification authority</font>

255
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:21,180
on behalf of a user or organization or

256
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:26,329
entity and the CA signs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oliphant what do</font>

257
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do we get it however</font>

258
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,450
certificates are meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

259
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,619
electronic form of trust how far do we

260
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,760
trust them well that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

261
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,260
that depends entirely on your

262
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,390
organization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you implemented</font>

263
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,230
well I want to be able to trust somebody

264
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,790
to not just load and unload the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trash</font>

265
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,170
well maybe automated certificates that

266
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,750
are created when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> click a button on</font>

267
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,670
the website somewhere that's enough to

268
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,870
say yeah if you've gotten<font color="#CCCCCC"> this far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

269
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,819
we're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust you without ever</font>

270
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,920
laying eyes on you or having any human

271
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,380
interaction but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really trust</font>

272
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,199
is it I mean if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust somebody</font>

273
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,279
imagine a mob movie a bad mom movie they

274
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">always have the same thing when they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bring in the mobster who want the guy</font>

276
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,230
who wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a mobster they sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

277
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,239
down they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to him they threatened</font>

278
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,220
him they threatened the kids they go to

279
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,750
even they break a finger a leg something

280
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,730
to say we're serious if you really want

281
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this it happens in all the action</font>

establishes that trust all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

284
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:28,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you have assurance levels or trust</font>

285
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,720
levels depending on how much rigmarole

286
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,820
has to be gone through to obtain a

287
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,820
certificate all right

288
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:42,170
that brings up just briefly self-signed

289
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:44,750
certificates yeah here's a great idea i

290
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,279
am going to print out my own certificate

291
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,170
of completion from MIT<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am a genius in</font>

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,689
my online<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a legend in my own mind I</font>

293
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,689
can do whatever I want I've printed it

294
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,190
I've put it on the wall I love me and no

295
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,170
one else is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe you no one</font>

296
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,699
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to trust you everyone will</font>

297
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,899
start to wonder if that jacket you're

298
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:08,620
wearing is little straighter than it

299
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:12,649
ought to be fine you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

300
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:16,009
source people trust which opens up a lot

301
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:18,589
larger doors and that brings up what I'm

302
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:20,769
referring to is chaining and this is

303
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,930
done by analogy of a wholesale club

304
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,899
anyone here have a an account has a

305
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,180
membership to a wholesale club yes yes

306
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,680
at least two people everyone else buys

307
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,170
their toilet paper at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regular store</font>

308
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,089
me I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cart whole thing's home</font>

309
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,959
I have so much deodorant I'm probably

310
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,209
set for another<font color="#E5E5E5"> six years one guy real</font>

311
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple wholesale club but how does it</font>

312
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">work when you go to the wholesale club</font>

313
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,310
you walk up to the wholesale club and

314
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:49,190
there is a gate guard the gate guard

315
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,459
stops you and says please show me your

316
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,889
ID you whip out that membership card to

317
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:58,359
that organization this establishes the

318
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:01,430
concept of the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> route chain</font>

319
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:04,670
so basically somebody higher up in the

320
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,829
authority food chain decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font>

321
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,120
to make an ID that looks like this this

322
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to look like here's</font>

323
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information it's going to contain it</font>

324
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,490
was all decided on and they said that's

325
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,349
how it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work we agree to that</font>

326
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">move it down the line and so people down</font>

327
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,089
all the way down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next level lower</font>

328
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,980
said we're going to go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and issue</font>

329
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:25,250
IDs to people that represent our

330
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,649
organization our club so let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

331
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,540
it in terms of a club what club do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

332
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:32,870
belong to well you can see there you've

333
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,699
got shams club and lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> co and each of</font>

334
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:37,160

335
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:38,839
the lost co card and say hello my name

336
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,730
is mr. Turing I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into</font>

337
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,580

in

339
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,360
because it's obviously not from that

340
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">club they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it on its</font>

341
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,230
face and at face value be able to tell

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,650
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

346
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,320
gate guard looked at it well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

347
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,010
when presenting electronic credentials

348
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,800
to a website or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service that service</font>

349
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,080
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at your certificate</font>

350
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,880
at the guts of your certificate it'll

351
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,880
kind of just unzip the thing look inside

352
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know oh that's not mine yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

353
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is sorry you're turned</font>

354
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,020
away don't come here with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in mind</font>

355
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,319
we now understand the concept of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

356
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,840
chain or a trust chain and why is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

357
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask you all who are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to join</font>

358
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,550
me here today why there's never one

359
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,620
standard statement there have to be 14

360
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,359
versions the same silly thing there's

361
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">always some other version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it it's not</font>

362
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,990
it's a issue leaf certificates leave

363
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,290
certificates we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

364
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,690
chain tree leaf why don't you just call

365
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">it an intensity certificate no no I'm a</font>

366
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,270
large corporation i'm going to call this

367
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">an EV certificate wait what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font>

368
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,020
a certificate that represents my

369
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,370
identity to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things well wait how</font>

370
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,079
much is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we're going to let you</font>

371
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,440
have what is your certificate going to

372
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,250
be allowed to do well I have to choose

373
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,630
the right group of people because

374
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">exceeding the right organization to get</font>

375
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,040
my cert from i'm getting the search from

376
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,210
an organization that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

377
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully be able to play well with</font>

378
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,250
others<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if i buy a membership to</font>

379
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,890
shams club and drive across town or go

380
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,170
to another state they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a</font>

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">sams club so what good are my</font>

382
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,310
credentials they're useless make sure

383
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,070
you get the right toys to work with the

384
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,930
right equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now let's talk</font>

385
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next part on the surface of it</font>

386
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:37,229
it was possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> when using the previous</font>

387
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,150
example that when entering the wholesale

388
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,300
club they looked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the card and they</font>

389
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:45,510
said yep looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yep not really</font>

390
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,949
expired come on in well this doesn't

391
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,750
take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other part of this</font>

392
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,160
where you examine the certificate more

393
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,410
closely and see if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some kind</font>

394
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,449
of no-fly list this is called

395
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,608
certificate revocation

396
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:57,439
checking or validation checking and this

397
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:59,839
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of represented by a nightclub</font>

398
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,309
bouncer we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen those TV shows or</font>

399
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,259
the group of people are in a line about

400
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">three million miles long they're trying</font>

401
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside the room and they just</font>

402
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,059
can't because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

403
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,980
large burly person standing there with a

404
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:11,449
clipboard and if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> names on the list</font>

405
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,220
you're allowed to come by or if you slip

406
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:14,540
them a 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something but the idea is</font>

407
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,759
there's this clipboard and you have to

408
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,439
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside and how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that you</font>

409
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,049
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that list in</font>

410
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:23,209
this case it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposite certificate</font>

411
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:25,399
revocation checking is actually a list

412
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,649
of bad certificates or certificates that

413
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,869
were revoked because someone left a

414
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,970
company or they were found to be doing

415
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">something they shouldn't be doing so</font>

416
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,249
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this no list the no list is</font>

417
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,529
our revocation list and it's called the

418
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:41,119
certificate revocation list and as you

419
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,220
can imagine if you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly large</font>

420
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:45,350
organization this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one heavy</font>

421
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,299
clipboard because there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

422
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,859
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

423
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,259
imagine a clipboard that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding</font>

424
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:52,279
papers that are about three feet thick

425
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:55,129
that kind of gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a pain in the</font>

426
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,869

427
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,339
doesn't matter it's too big to dig

428
00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:00,139
through it takes too long everything's

429
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,449
too slow so they have to come up with

430
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:05,569
these other technologies that simplify

431
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:07,069
and make it more efficient and there are

432
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:11,089
other methods that go with that too but

433
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:14,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get the idea all right hauling</font>

434
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:19,069

everybody well that's an obvious

437
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:25,579
question it's never a good idea to trust

438

to have certain code signing

of these certificates are years and

mechanism because without it the whole

part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this there are more certificate</font>

them real quick if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have one of</font>

stress this enough it is hugely

you're on do not pass go do not go home

go

better go to class or whatever you were

515
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,889
doing you must know where you left off

<font color="#E5E5E5">and this little checklist on the bottom</font>

because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like pie and it's obvious but</font>

because this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> cookbook that's</font>

00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,320
starting point and how you make your

528
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,809
crust is important and how you base or

529
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,570
start your certificate request is just

530
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,149
as important no the tool you're about to

531
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,700
use or find an easier one to use if

532
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:06,649
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure what you're about to do</font>

00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:13,039
in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases it's a pay for exercise</font>

535
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:15,499
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a human being at</font>

536
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,329
some point on the other end looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

537
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:18,919
this request and they're going to

538
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:20,629
process what they're handed because

539
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,159
they're under the impression that the

540
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:26,718
person submitting it knows what they're

541
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:29,299
doing it's a fairly obvious action I may

542
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:31,579
I click the button I'm responsible I did

543
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,459
it but then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> result and</font>

544
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,829
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't figure out what gent is up why</font>

545
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,709
not we didn't write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down where the heck</font>

546
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:42,109
we were so what changes if crust is

547
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:43,789
always the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

the bits to our certificates and we've

553
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:57,199
talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support people before we</font>

00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:59,839
submit there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of processes in</font>

555
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,219
this frustrating technological life that

please take the time to save<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself</font>

the headache you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see I don't have</font>

560
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,779
much hair left and I a lot of that loss

561
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,359
to pki in my opinion because a lot of

562
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:21,920
folks just willy-nilly go<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicking the</font>

our call trying to talk someone down

565
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,080
from a technological edge I'm sure

566
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,090
you've all had similar kinds of

567
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,990
experiences how many developers are in

<font color="#E5E5E5">three how many headaches have you had</font>

573
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,070
because of this process it's 10 20 30

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:55,159
excedrin but it's a very laborious task

577
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,600
and one that nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes doing and I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know why it just advanced on me</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">good point but the point is in these</font>

582
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,250
slides there is a real basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

583
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,410
when you're making your request don't

584
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,290
tell anyone else I told you this back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

the private key and safely store it

587
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,010
offline only backup your private key

588
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,080
it's like making yourself a

589
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,570
get-out-of-jail-free card but realize

590

593
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,810
this is the most important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

594
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,960
nutritious and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tasty pie making</font>

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will help save you hours of time</font>

600
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:51,469
this dovetails into why would we choose

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things this way why would we take</font>

governance and everybody hates it and

609
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,410
they heat the person who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wear</font>

that hat and sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say no no</font>

to do that please and then you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

614
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,190
arguments about it and policy arguments

615
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,590
are like playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a game of operation</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> five year olds arguing about what</font>

drunken Scrabble that's a pretty good

626
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,850
one you ever tried to have an argument

627

<font color="#CCCCCC">with somebody over whether Queenie is a</font>

628
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,360
word and they look in the book and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

629
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,980
know there's a house rule that you have

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,129
to take a shot or lose a turn or

631
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,630
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse if it's not a word</font>

632
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:03,230
that's what policy arguments are all day

633
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:05,560
long and when you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it it kind</font>

634
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,580
of explains why there's so much scotch

635
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,190
involved with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who write or work</font>

636
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,560
with policy because it really is a

637
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,830
horrifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience it's not always</font>

638
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,230
glamorous it's a pain because you're

639
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,730
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the rules and everybody</font>

640
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,770
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to argue about the rules but no</font>

641
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:25,960
one wants to be responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

642
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:29,030
rules and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings up a huge point on</font>

643
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,430
the right there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graphic that</font>

00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:40,040
super secret or crazy this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

at no cost on the website let's list it

in excruciating<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tiny text on the</font>

649

bottom but I assure you you can find

650
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:48,850
this using your favorite search engine

651
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,800
of choice what can be seen here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a massive list of how to</font>

00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,889
protect something each of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

658
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,680
confusing as heck why what is the

659
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,340
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> here well it's policy it's not</font>

660
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,440
glamorous and in fact it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of</font>

661
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,629
meetings and back and forth with people

662
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,070
to agree or at least disagree to the

663
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,130
point where it slides through unnoticed

664
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,790
because success in policy is measured by

665
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:27,410
how long you're able to hold a grudge<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

666
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:30,710
you're able to sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep that</font>

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">grudge alive or your point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> delicately</font>

668
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:35,750
refer to it as a grudge then you will

669
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:39,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to win what is winning</font>

670
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,990
winning in policy land is the ability to

671
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,300
carry an

672
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,220
idea all the way to fruition and make

673
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it's in the document because it</font>

674
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,740
actually matters and if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

675
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,720

677
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,820
those then it's worth it to usually get

678

predicated on the idea that we give a

facts about how to be exploited in

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:29,150
certain ways so what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have years</font>

organizations

723
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,570
the industry could actually take steps

724
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,550
and establish their own and they

725
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,620
realized the cost of entry was a little

726
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:03,960
higher at first but they could then

727
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,120
issue all the certificates they wanted

728
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,250
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of their individuals so that they</font>

could individually interact with their

00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,960
government counterparts without so much

money<font color="#E5E5E5"> being spent or time taken why</font>

732
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:20,190
because the company took ownership of

having this so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the years the</font>

excuse me but there are several versions

<font color="#E5E5E5">that they have stood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up of their own</font>

738
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:34,290
from large firms and organizations which

739
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,240
has led to a look we've figured out more

740
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:37,680
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should actually take some of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that on we've learned a lot of lessons</font>

742
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,480
let's do this again it was so much from

743
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first three times there's another</font>

744
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,410

747
00:29:51,830 --> 00:30:01,250
who knows what it was signed sadly it's

748
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:04,350
me because I'm that guy in April of 2011

749
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:07,610
it was important that this got signed

750
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:11,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it meant something is starting</font>

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,980
already what does this mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

758
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,409
it's not an easy site to navigate it's

759
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:33,960
full of big documents with words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

760
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,440
are a buck 25 each and they're very high

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,530
falutin words and it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> up fuh skated</font>

762
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,030
because it's hard hopefully this

00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,730
presentation just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes some of the real</font>

out it's not pulled because who wants to

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,260
works the game is we're only going to

798
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,550
share a piece of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do and</font>

799
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,800
we're going to stop at this line right

800
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,540
here I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossing this line it's up</font>

802
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,300

<font color="#CCCCCC">mom-and-pop shop the company the</font>

805
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,639
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not so guess what happens</font>

806
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,130
kids policy development has a cyclical

807
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,010
flow it started two years ago on the

808
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,870
ball is rolling this is an opportunity

809
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,940
to get involved at this stage because

810
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:48,810
the documentation being published and

811
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,210
released is open for comment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

812
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">closing all the time imagine a series of</font>

813
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,900
windows being opened that are closing

814
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,850
all the time so that at some point in

815
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,410
the future when a document comes out

816
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,080
that says well I'm so sorry I can't

817
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,730
accept that document from you anymore

818
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,379
didn't you see the updates we're

819
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,180
switching to a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> new electronic</font>

820
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,630
system you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font>

821
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,860
cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you can't play well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

822
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a card what are you talking about</font>

823
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,590
well we published it

824
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,970
year there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete open thing I</font>

825
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,429
mean we published it in the Federal

826
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:20,860
Register didn't you read the Federal

827
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,920
Register know there's an iPad app for

828
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,330
that do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it was an</font>

829
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,830
accident I went looking for something

830
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">else probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something about cheese and</font>

831
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:33,280
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I know BAM I found that</font>

832
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,570
there are these steering committees I'm

833
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,670
not looking for one thing and fell down

834
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">a rabbit hole and the steering</font>

835
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,770
committees actually contribute to how

836
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:44,590
the working groups that exist below them

837
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,150
see there's a hierarchy here so the

838
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,330
steering committees decide what needs to

839
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,940
be done the steering committee then sets

840
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,429
up working groups and engineering groups

841
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,230
and they discuss all the relevant things

842
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,510
of the day and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes out of this</font>

843
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:01,480
let's look at the chart here on the side

844
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:06,700
things start generally as rfcs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font>

845
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,110
is a nerdy group what's an RFC thank you

846
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you for waking up I appreciate</font>

847
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:13,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your wake-up call we have</font>

848
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,159
15 minutes to go maybe less by the way

849
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:21,850
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all very much for hanging in</font>

850
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so rfcs lead to anger which leads</font>

852
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,909
lead to standards which are commonly

853
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,770
published by organizations like nist

854
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,929
those standards are then adopted by

<font color="#CCCCCC">policymakers who exist in these working</font>

856
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:41,649
groups because they cite those standards

857
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:44,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tend to look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

858
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:47,139
RFC is a nice innocuous framework an

idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea has consequences</font>

860
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,908
that's not a bad thing that's a good

look down at a process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see all</font>

864
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,030
the broken parts and say what happened

did anybody actually talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyone else</font>

870
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,900
organizations that happen to care have

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,970
an opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to get</font>

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,740
involved and make a difference whether

it's through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or on your own as a</font>

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:28,549
it is a worthwhile thing to dig into one

chase down some of these pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try</font>

to see where they fit it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

weird reverse engineering process to

882
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,009
kind of build the stat to see why these

883
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,210
things are so convoluted because people

884
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes who you would not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

having involvement in these talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

present and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usual suspects or</font>

887
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,910
trust specs are usually involved as well

888
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,890
and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that silence is an</font>

indication that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just keep going</font>

890
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,400
because there's no one who stands to

opposes well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't seem</font>

892
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:09,980
right so to cover what we've covered in

893
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:12,730
the covering of this cover we have

894
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,860
looked at the building blocks of

895
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:18,860
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus authorization the</font>

896
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:20,690
concept of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificates only matter</font>

897
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,530
when they're signed by somebody we care

898
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:27,020
about or trust what kind of trust and

899
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,090
which club we belong to establish where

900
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,330
those certificates are able to be used

901
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:34,280
and we have to check in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

902
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,440
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in somewhere to make sure</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our certificate isn't on a no list</font>

somewhere certificate revocation all of

905
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,260
this just has to remind us<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even</font>

00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">though we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

correctly from a techie point of view

908
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:50,150
check which certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> store you're</font>

909

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just because it's on a</font>

it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in the same</font>

point to the one in windows which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

great when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on windows and</font>

917
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,560
then you load that happy little virtual

918
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:12,080
machine that's running chrome all by

919

itself in a boon to<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some other flavor</font>

920
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,670
and you suddenly discover there's no

00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:20,060
shared trust or where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that trust store</font>

922
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:21,710
and a new quest a side quest begins and

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,390
in anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who has ever played any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

those online games<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows we all hate</font>

925
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:29,930
side quests we just want to get done

926
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,120
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came to do beyond that we tried</font>

927
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,919
to cover the idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pie is a good</font>

928
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,200
thing even<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubly so when thinking of PK</font>

929
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,119
the process has<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know where you</font>

930
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,640
left off and it will be easier far

931
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,130
easier to accomplish your goal which is

932
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,640
to save your precious hair follicles or

933
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,200
at least your blood pressure and lastly

934
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,569
we want to talk about governance and

935
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,939
policy stay classy it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

936
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:57,690
devolve into some kind of food<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight or</font>

937
00:37:53,940 --> 00:38:00,119
shouting<font color="#E5E5E5"> match goodness I know I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

938
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,829
a few of them sometimes sadly in public

939
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,380
at conferences that are not like these

940
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:07,559
and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have but one goal in mind</font>

941
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,059
their own agenda and that's what we have

942
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bury here if you really want to get</font>

943
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:14,790
something done sometimes it's far better

944
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:19,020
to get involved involved excuse me and

945
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:22,079
pursue that better goal rather than just

946
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,819
fall into obscurity and not know what's

947
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,910
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept what comes</font>

948

up as it happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stick my head in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

949
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,899
sand personally about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local news</font>

950
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:34,170
because if I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch a</font>

951
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,170
deathmatch or the tally scoreboard I

952
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,109
would go look at the websites for the

953
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,720
capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flag from cons or I'd go and</font>

954
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:44,730
watch someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> play some first person</font>

955
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,740
shooter that's how I generally tend to

956
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,170
view the news right or wrong a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

957
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,479
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this results in is sometimes</font>

958
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,690
current events<font color="#CCCCCC"> get away from me which is</font>

959
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,369
why I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankful there is Twitter</font>

960
00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:00,059
because in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> last quick reference</font>

961
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:03,180
twitter is like headlines headlines lead

962
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,770
to articles so follow the people who say

963
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,569
things you care about so you can find

964
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,859
their articles oh wait that means the

965
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically become a</font>

deconstructed newspaper well that's one

967
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:16,919
way to stay current after all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this I</font>
