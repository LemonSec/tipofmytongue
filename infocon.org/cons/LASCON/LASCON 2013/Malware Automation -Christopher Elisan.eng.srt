00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,370
out and watching the presentation thank

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,050
you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction so today we're</font>

5
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:33,290
going to talk about malware automation

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,760
but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> begin I'll just discuss</font>

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:40,309
the most important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:42,230
presentation Who am I so as mentioned

9
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:46,160
that the principal malware sang tasted

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,500
ours a and also the author of Mallory

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">kitson botnets it's a trilogy so this is</font>

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first part I'm working on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,579
two so if you have a budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a book</font>

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,790
this year please get a copy of the book

15
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,730
all proceeds go to my two kids 529

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,330
college fund<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as we all know college</font>

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:09,229
is very expensive so please get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy</font>

18
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,450
it's on sale in amazon by the way and as

19

fresh out of college and then they

24
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:27,169
trained me how to reverse member so I'm

25

00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:09,949
about the top so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

40
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you an over-the-shoulder view of how</font>

41
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:16,220
attackers create malware in a ver in an

42
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,690
automated fashion so for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,140
understand that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be discussing</font>

44
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,440
first the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware the</font>

45
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,958
attackers arsenal and then the creation

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,660
process of an army of<font color="#E5E5E5"> armored malware</font>

47
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,570
and we will also discuss the

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,420
advantages of automation and then i will

49
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you guys a demo so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i learned a hard</font>

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,579
lesson actually give live demos<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,530
live demo here but just in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

52
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:49,860
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup alright so the current</font>

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:53,400
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware so as you can see here</font>

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,100
in this chart this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ashley represents the</font>

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,350
total number of unique malware that has

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,859
been discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> year-on-year so this</font>

57
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:05,730
chart was updated last<font color="#E5E5E5"> october fifth and</font>

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,220
the sequence see compared to a 2012 it's

59
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">already like 60 million more unique</font>

60
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,310
malware that were discovered but then

61
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,440
again there's a flaw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this chart the</font>

62
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,750
way it represents a uniqueness in

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,450
malware because here it represents

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,260
uniqueness in malware based on hash so

65
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,299
that means if you get a malware file at

66
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,370
one bite at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of that file rehash</font>

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,800
it then they would say it's a totally

68
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,580
unique malware but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's just</font>

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same malware so that's one thing</font>

70
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,209
that's wrong with this chart but every

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">year we get charts like this from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

72
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,740
security providers designed to scare us

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:49,440
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think but then again all of these</font>

74
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,090
statistics here they're real and this

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,430
only represents those that were

76
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,800
discovered it doesn't represent malware

77
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,020
that hasn't been discovered yet so a

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:03,330
friend of mine mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Solomon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonja when he</font>

79
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,459
presented in a hacker halted one of the

80
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,380
figures he cited<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center multiply this by</font>

81
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:12,959
four and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mallar</font>

82
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:15,480
that hasn't been discovered yet so

83
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,730
before when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes to campaigns or</font>

84
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,608
malware outbreak there's only one

85
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,650
malware involved if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the copy of</font>

86
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that malware create a solution for that</font>

87
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,570
malware deployed the solution you

88
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,580
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop the malware outbreak so</font>

89
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,840
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the story so SQL</font>

90
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,050
slammer Melissa I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> you warm my doom</font>

91
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,330
all of those attacks were named after

92
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,890
the malware because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

93
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,448
malware that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for these</font>

94
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:47,930
attacks but today most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

95
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:50,509
attack campaigns that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

96
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,969
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> an army of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> armored malware so it's</font>

97
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just one malware or one family of</font>

98
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:57,589
malware these multiple families to

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,349
conduct their attack the main concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

100
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attackers is the functionality of</font>

101
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,949
the malgor if the malware has the

102
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,859
functionality they need they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

103
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:09,439
in their campaign and if you stop one

104
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,539
malware you just stop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware the</font>

105
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,210
other malware that are in part of that

106
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,580
campaign they keep on doing their own

107
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,779
directive and if they're stealing

108
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,859
information they keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on sending</font>

109
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:25,520
information to the attackers so how are

110
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,819
they doing it they have tools so they

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,120
have the DIY<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids they use armory tools</font>

112
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:34,249
and they also use AV scanners as part of

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,270
their own QA which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will explain later</font>

114
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:41,289
in this presentation so when I was

115
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:45,169
starting my career this was the first

116
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:47,360
DIY kit that i stumbled upon this was

117
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,128
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a 15 year old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kid he was 15</font>

118
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,490
years old during this time from<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicago</font>

119
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this was really cool when the first</font>

120
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,879
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i saw this kid because you don't</font>

121
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,580
need to have assembly language skills

122
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,139
that we create your own malware unlike

123
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,300
before if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create malware you</font>

124
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,860
need to know assembly language skills

125
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,439
but here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:11,240
command line you can create your<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font>

127
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:13,430
and other groups one which calls

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,379
themselves PS MPC also created their own

129
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,270
so the same concept you just need to

130
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the command line and then you can</font>

131
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,580
create your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own malware or during that</font>

132
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,620
time virus that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> pcl viruses</font>

133
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:34,399
creation labs<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast forward 10 15 years</font>

134
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:36,529
we get spy I and we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> soos so the</font>

135
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,330
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

136
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,310
this presentation are the main

137
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,459
differences between these two sets of

138
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,499
kids so the kids before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

139
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:47,779
about the pissing contest like my kid is

140
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:51,229
better than your kid while the kids

141
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:53,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">today they're more geared for online</font>

142
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,610
crime like<font color="#CCCCCC"> are stealing information</font>

143
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:59,020
making money for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> graders who or</font>

144
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,129
whoever who bought the two

145
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,460
that they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their campaign it's</font>

146
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:07,550
more about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybercrime and another</font>

147
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,770
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember also when</font>

148
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,449
comparing the kids of all to the kids of

149
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:16,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">the day is that vcl and PS MPC they can</font>

150
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:19,430
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> create finite number of malware</font>

151
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:22,279
samples so if they can only create 20

152
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,229
samples 50 samples it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to</font>

153
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,659
create solutions for those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

154
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,669
even need to reverse engineer the kid

155
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to generate all those</font>

156
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,409
samples and then you can solve them

157
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:36,258
that's why they were cool but they were

158
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:38,740
not that hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop we could create</font>

159
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:44,150
signatures for all of those in one day

160
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:46,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">but with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spy on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zeus virtually they can</font>

161
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,580
create infinite number of unique malware

162
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:52,460
samples that's because they use time as

163
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:55,550
a seed so as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> time exists they</font>

164
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:00,080
would create unique unique infinite

165
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,669
malware samples so the only the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,258
time they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a unique matter</font>

167
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:12,080
example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> universe rip and</font>

168
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:15,259
we're all back into being Stardust's so

169
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,258
arming tools so most of the DIY kits

170
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,779
they already offer some sort of armoring

171
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:22,370
or protection for the malware but of

172
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the attackers want to rely solely</font>

173
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,490
on the protective mechanisms being

174
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:31,849
offered by the DIY tips so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of</font>

175
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:34,070
arming tools as well so uh one of the

176
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,708
most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> arming tutor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> packers so we</font>

177
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,320
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different papers we have upx you</font>

178
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:45,290
have belied the meteor and all that and

179
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,589
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them like for this one these are</font>

180
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:51,740
just based on three modules that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

181
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,560
google and most attackers they will just

182
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,690
create a fancy GUI out of those are

183
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,670
publicly available modules and then they

184
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,010
would sell this uh in different hyper

185
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,930
forums and some script kiddies would

186
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,600
actually buy this for like ten dollars

187
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,209
fifteen dollars a pop so if they have

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">1000 customers for ten dollars that's</font>

189
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:14,359
ten thousand dollars for them

190
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:19,040
already and it only takes like a couple

191
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,060
of hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grade this so like</font>

194
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,100
one offer additional options so as you

195
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,950
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the right it says there can</font>

compress resources it has anti debugger

197
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,860
crack you can compress icons most of

198
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,170
these features aptly<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but some of</font>

199
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,020
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't work but some of the</font>

200
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:46,130
buyers of these tools they really don't

201
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,220
check so for me the way I analyze all of

202
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,010
this is that I have a bond file so I

203
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,530
would subject that pawn file to each of

204
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,390
these options<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then sometimes when</font>

205
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,610
you look at it it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> garbage of code</font>

206
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,350
they just add garbage of code sometimes

207
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,260
it's all of them only like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

208
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,110
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> X or a register and then</font>

209
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,900
that's it but still some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

210
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:13,250
buy this but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course that doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

211
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some of the options here don't work</font>

212
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,660
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more important ones they</font>

213
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,940
really work and they give researchers

214
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,620
and security products a hard time

215
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,300
especially when it's a when it's a when

216
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,130
it comes to analyzing and reversing

217
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,349
malware so another army tool like for

218
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,510
this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> indetectable net some</font>

219
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,640
people if they don't have access to

220
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,100
those tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned you could</font>

221
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,110
go online like that and then get

222
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,150
services like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so indetectable</font>

223
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,990
studnet when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was doing my research and</font>

224
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this was free but now you need to</font>

225
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,990
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain code and you need to know</font>

226
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:57,350
the secret the URL so that you can

227
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">access this website so what it does it</font>

228
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,150
asks you to upload your<font color="#E5E5E5"> files and then</font>

229
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,870
it would give you an encrypted version

230
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,790
of it but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if I were if I were</font>

231
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer of this one I would think</font>

232
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,810
Dwight twice about uploading my files

233
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's not nobody or</font>

234
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,680
nothing stopping them from keeping those

235
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,870
files that are uploading to their

236
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,510
website first number one I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

237
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,490
who owns the websites but still people

238
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,120
with Ashley

239
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:30,310
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> surfaces of this website and in</font>

240
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,149
underground you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> athle sell malware</font>

241
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,589
samples for one cent or even to a dollar

242
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,930
depending on how sophisticated that

243
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,920
matter sample is so if they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

244
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:45,430
gather 1 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mallory samples then</font>

245
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,170
they just encrypted set it to sell it in

246
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the underground for once and that's a</font>

247
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,449
lot of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these people who are</font>

248
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,699
running the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus having services</font>

249
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're aptly victimized in a</font>

250
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,730
in three ways so number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you just</font>

251
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave them your file and number two you</font>

252
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,050
just gave them your credit card number

253
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,089
so that you could get the key codes and

254
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,609
the secret URL to license their website

255
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,980
plus they charge you 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 euros for</font>

256
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,420
that access so you're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

257
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:19,570
victimized three times so another arming

258
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,829
tool is called the file<font color="#E5E5E5"> joiner and an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ex</font>

259
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:26,770
a bundler so these two tools I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

260
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:29,860
call them the information routine

261
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,480
converted into a tool so before most

262
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">infections routine are built into the</font>

263
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,000
viruses or into the malware because

264
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,339
their main concern is to infect all the

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,750
files in the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if they happen to</font>

266
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:45,700
infect a very popular program somebody

267
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,100
would copy that transporter discs it and

268
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,450
then that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> gate would be like to a</font>

269
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,880
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that friend would put in</font>

270
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:55,350
the PC execute that program then the pc

271
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,490
will get infected but of course nowadays

272
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,550
malware writers don't concern themselves

273
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,740
with an infection routines but if

274
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,319
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to spread their program</font>

275
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,560
all over the world and make it enticing

276
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,390
they use these kinds of tools to bundle

277
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,420
their program with a very popular

278
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,480
applications so other I don't have a

279
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,750
screenshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but there are tools also</font>

280
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,149
like this that are for android apps so

281
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,089
you bundle you just write your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

282
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:27,579
malicious or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java code and then bundle</font>

283
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,860
it with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app and then you can</font>

284
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:34,120
post it in a third party google play on

285
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">vacations so the main idea here is that</font>

286
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,580
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very popular app you get your</font>

287
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,680
program your money

288
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,320
this program bundled it together and

289
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">then spread</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it around you could post it</font>

290

in a file sharing websites you could use

293
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,630
as it's very enticing now software when

294
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,520
this tool first came out software

295
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,540
publishers what they did is that they

296
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,240
started posting the hash of their

297
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,500
software that the users download but

298
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,440
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course if their website is not</font>

299
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure enough nobody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is preventing the</font>

hackers or i should say hackers are good

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,000
people the attackers from compromised

302
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,820
from compromising their website and

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,160
changing the hash to reflect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash of</font>

304
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,140
their creation bundled with a legitimate

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,810
software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> AV scanners AV scanners</font>

306
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,930
they're used for quality assurance

307
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,119
purposes now if it's a highly funded

308
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,150
attacker group they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different</font>

of virtualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> of virtual machines</font>

310
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,970
that have different our security

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,680
products installed so that they could

312
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,840
submit all their creations there and see

313
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,420
whether it's detected or not and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

314
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,120
them even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> security appliances that</font>

315
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,959
they have in their lab depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how</font>

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,580
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money the sponsor has but for this</font>

resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just use a multi</font>

319
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,600
AV scanner so this one athlete downloads

320
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,089
all of the engines from popular vendors

321
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,830
and then subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> their malware creation</font>

322
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,580
here to check whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's detected or</font>

323
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,840
not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an on-premise virustotal</font>

324
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,410
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the disadvantage of using</font>

325
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,020
this tool is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they remove some</font>

326
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,589
of the features that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause all of these</font>

327
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,880
AV engines to actually have conflict

328
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,340
when they're installed in the system

329
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,980
they also remove the dynamic scanning

330
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,950
features so what's the what's left there

331
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that only the static scanning using</font>

332
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,170
signatures or whatever the security

333
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,720
product is using it virtually killed the

334
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,699
heuristics and dynamic capability of the

335
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,500
security products although they

336
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,790
understand the trace most attacker

337
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:48,350
groups still use this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools now</font>

338
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,569
if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> small time attacker and they</font>

339
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,490
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or don't have dental</font>

340
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:57,680
to buy the tool they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> always go to</font>

341
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,170
sites like this like virustotal<font color="#CCCCCC"> novar</font>

342
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">tanks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> veer scan but the most popular</font>

343
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:05,270
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've only seen used is no virus</font>

344
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks it's because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the option there</font>

345
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,420
that says do not distribute the sample

346
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,320
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course even if you take that</font>

347
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,819
there's no way of saying that they're

348
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,740
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not distributing it to AV</font>

349
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies publishers are usually there</font>

350
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,850
somewhere that says even if you take

351
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:23,120
this if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find this to be detected by</font>

352
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,490
five or more a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors we will</font>

353
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,670
automatically submit this to two

354
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,120
security companies but then of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

355
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:35,209
some have some attackers they would

356
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,770
athle risk it because the fact of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

357
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:40,010
matter is is that most security

358
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies they receive hundreds of</font>

359
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:46,670
thousands of samples a day and like our

360
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,250
keynote this morning prioritization is

361
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,439
important if you cannot do it if you

362
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,180
could not do everything so nobody can

363
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,990
process hundreds of thousands of samples

364
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,729
a day so what security<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies do is</font>

365
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,720
that they prioritize all of these

366
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:06,199
samples samples coming from high high

367
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,910
paying customers are handled first and

368
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,050
those that come from these sources like

369
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:14,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually it's sits there for months</font>

370
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if they have automated systems that</font>

371
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,740
automatically analyze malware great

372
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,629
signature for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's some of</font>

373
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,079
these samples they sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for months</font>

374
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,870
even years that's why it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

375
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,990
even when a malware when a big company

376
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:32,149
gets infected most AV companies would

377
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,730
say hey we have that sample in our

378
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,590
collection the past three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so</font>

379
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:43,120
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the manpower</font>

380
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:43,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the process</font>

381
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,510
if you have the DIY kit you would be

382
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,070
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to produce your DIY kit malware and</font>

383
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,290
then that malware you can subject it to

384
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,470
different standalone arming tools you

385
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,360
can mix and match together this the

386
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,660
different learning tools the more you

387
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the more you randomize the order of</font>

388
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,980
the tools

389
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,840
you mess up the researchers that would

390
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,550
try to analyze and reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the malware</font>

391
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,919
and also confuse the security products

392
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,080
that you're up against so always

393
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,420
remember that the attackers creation the

394
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,370
malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up against two folds the</font>

395
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:21,010
researcher and the security products and

396
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,309
most of these tools athlete take care of

397
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,379
making sure those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two foals have their</font>

398
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:31,690
lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> miserable when they're handling</font>

399
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:33,460
this kinds of malware and once you have

400
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,490
aptly submitted all of those two

401
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,540
different stand stand alone arming tools

402
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,590
then the Quality Assurance process

403
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,720
begins now they can use a on-premise AV

404
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,899
in the cloud AV different security

405
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,570
appliances network appliances I guess

406
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all that depends on how much they're</font>

407
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,659
funded and then if it passes their

408
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:59,740
quality assurance then you have an army

409
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:02,559
of armored<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware and also if you don't</font>

410
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,540
have money<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy a DIY kit like a car</font>

411
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,570
before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was leaked out it was</font>

412
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:11,340
reportedly being sold underground for 40

413
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,990
grand a pop but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that need out</font>

414
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,629
they do just google it for zero dollars

415
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,390
and then you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a copy of it Kim</font>

416
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm apni hosts the copy of that in his</font>

417
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">own megaupload side so if you don't have</font>

418
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,050
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use old</font>

419
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,800
malware and subject them to different

420
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,360
standard on arming tools do quality

421
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,790
assurance and then you have an army of

422
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,590
armored malware actually because of this

423
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,059
it gave me I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk like this a</font>

424
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,490
thing like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years ago I</font>

425
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">called it the green malware made from</font>

426
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,140
one hundred percent recycled malware

427
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,330
because you just get malware and that it

428
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,690
it's made new again by all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

429
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,939
tools now the inspiration for that talk

430
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,130
was that in my previous adventure one

431
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,179
client oddly approached<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and he said</font>

432
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:07,929
or they said we got infected by a very

433
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:10,240
sophisticated malware now most fortune

434
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,070
companies when they get in fact that

435
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,520
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say it's a very complicated</font>

436
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:17,399
malware but then after beating away all

437
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,160
of the

438
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,350
ducted mechanisms after weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and months</font>

439
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,960
of work I found out that that matter is

440
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:28,590
like five between five<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years old</font>

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,330
it's a very old malware that at least

442
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,010
strengthens my belief that attackers

443
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,750
really don't care whether the malware is

444
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,270
new or old as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it has the</font>

445
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,580
behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need or the</font>

446
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,379
capability that they need and once it

447
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,210
has actually their main concern is the

448
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,340
capability and then protecting their

449
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,290
creation so once they find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

450
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,820
that has the capability they need the

451
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">only thing they need to do is to make</font>

452
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it's protected enough so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

453
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,389
could bypass different their security

454
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,030
products and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make life hard for</font>

455
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:03,240
researchers if ever there samples get

456
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:07,440
captured and subjected to different<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

457
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">malware analysis and methods so speaking</font>

458
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,020
of QA quality assurance so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Quality</font>

459
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Assurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oddly depends on the attack</font>

460
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:20,550
type so we know to attack types one is a

461
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,530
targeted attack so in a targeted attack

462
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:27,090
if the malware can escape through

463
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">different security products employed by</font>

464
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,290
the company or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the enterprise they're</font>

465
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,480
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack they wouldn't mind</font>

466
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,879
releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that malware even if it's</font>

467
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,220
affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five percent of all</font>

468
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,680
security products or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

469
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,690
of other security appliances if it's not

470
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,580
detected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five percent and it just</font>

471
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,530
so happens that five percent is the one

472
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,250
being used by the company they wouldn't

473
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:53,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind deploying it so when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to QA</font>

474
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,790
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Utley on how they would</font>

475
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack it depends on the type of attack</font>

476
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,510
now also when it comes to targeted

477
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:04,500
attacks mostly those that are targeted

478
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,790
are people that have access to sensitive

479
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,940
information within their company

480
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:12,420
sometimes it's based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> roles probably</font>

481
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:16,620
they would they would target the c-level

482
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:18,360
executives or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network management any</font>

483
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">person within the company that has</font>

484
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,889
access to sensitive information within

485
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the company now if the company doesn't</font>

486
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:29,160
have any segmented network meaning if a

487
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,080
receptionist computer can have access to

488
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,710
sensitive data then they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font>

489
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,570
target

490
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,070
the receptionist and it for them it's

491
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,840
much more easier because most of the

492
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,539
time when there's a security education

493
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,090
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the company usually the</font>

494
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:44,370
receptionist is left out most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

495
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,918
employees are attending the security

496
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:50,969
awareness and most of the people are

497
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,799
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> out like the receptionist's so and</font>

498
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,320
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this one like a based on my</font>

499
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,850
experience every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we would talk to a</font>

500
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,379
company in my previous adventure we

501
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,689
would also talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the family members</font>

502
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,399
of these people like other immediate

503
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,309
family members or members living in the

504
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:06,899
same house we made them aware also of

505
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,350
security and also leaking out

506
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:13,559
information within their social media

507
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">circles like for one example let's say</font>

508
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,779
he's a c-level executive in a fortune

509
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,090
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and he's attending last con</font>

510
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:24,360
and he has a daughter the daughter would

511
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,270
say hey guys party at my place my dad is

512
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,750
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird conference I had no idea</font>

513
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's called last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> con it's</font>

514
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,909
there until<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday so party at my place</font>

515
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:39,090
now if attackers are actually monitoring

516
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,250
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> his family's social network that</font>

517
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:45,360
would give them enough information that

518
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,429
we try to a fish ship now they could

519
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,370
send him email thank you for attending

520
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:52,950
last con we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate your</font>

attendance please click this link to

522
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,789
print out a certificate or if there's an

00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:59,189
attachment there please click the

524
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:01,470
attachment it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sign of our</font>

525
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,419
thank you and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now if he's</font>

526
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,750
tech-savvy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know this is</font>

527
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:08,700
this is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hoax but then again</font>

528
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,990
not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are tech savvy enough to</font>

529
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:17,070
actually not do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is saying</font>

530
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,809
now most attackers if it's if it's

531
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,730
really a high-profile target and they

532
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,649
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the company some</font>

533
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,049
of them won't send him email instead

534
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:26,908
they would send him a snail mail

535
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably that snail mail would have</font>

536
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:33,480
picked out of a URL what could have a

537
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,059
USB stick or whatever or anything there

538
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,580
that would actually make him do

539
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,590
something to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mallory deployment</font>

540
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,939
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hack malware installed in</font>

541
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,419
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and of course another attack</font>

542
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,970
type

543
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,920
opportunistic attack so every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

544
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,590
take off opportunistic it reminds<font color="#E5E5E5"> me of</font>

545
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,770
Oprah Winfrey you know how in her show

546
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:58,350
she always says too bad they're not

547
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,420
Oprah or else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you guys you get</font>

548
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:05,399
the car you get a car you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the car</font>

549
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and all of you will be this happy so so</font>

550
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,660
she likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away stuff to</font>

551
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,540
everybody so opportunistic attack is

552
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,370
like that the attackers spread the

553
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,440
malware and they really don't care who

554
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,989
gets infected at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day they</font>

555
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,410
just check their control panel and see

556
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:24,090
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get infected and if it's</font>

557
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,550
an opportunistic attack when it comes to

558
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,649
quality assurance now they're more

559
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,919
concerned about their creation not being

560
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,500
detected by most security products and

561
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,140
security appliances and once they become

562
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,200
successful of course they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all happy</font>

563
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,900
they reap the rewards of stealing all of

564
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,290
those information from the compromised

565
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:51,540
machines so why are they<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font>

566
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:54,540
exponential effect the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the</font>

567
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,920
more chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you winning and also if</font>

568
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,659
you don't want to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a campaign</font>

569
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,060
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always sell it in the</font>

570
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,100
underground imagine if you have if you

571
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,320
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce hundreds of thousands of</font>

572
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,969
samples a day and you have buyers for

573
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:12,780
one cent<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that's a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money and</font>

574
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:14,880
easy malware update also to not AV out

575
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,889
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> AV but most security vendors</font>

576
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,100
even security<font color="#E5E5E5"> appliances it depends on</font>

577
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the budget that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tackle group has</font>

578
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,030
and the amount of security appliances

579
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,919
and security products they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access</font>

580
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:31,200
to so exponential effect as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

581
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,450
can produce infinite amount of number of

582
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,360
malware samples and then you can mix and

583
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,520
match them so even if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have one</font>

584
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,399
malware from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware DIY</font>

585
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,530
kit or even from an old malware you can

586
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,600
do this but the good thing about Mallory

587
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,490
DIY kits especially if it's the one that

588
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,840
can produce infinite number of malware

589
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:56,010
samples if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> create as many as</font>

590
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,720
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get one subjected into an</font>

591
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,070
arming tool now most are bring tools

592
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,250
also use time

593
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">see so based on one sample could also</font>

594
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:10,370
create infinite amount of malware

595
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:14,610
samples and then and so on and so forth

596
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:18,629
so this athlete makes things hard for

597
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,070
researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and automated systems now if</font>

598
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,929
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really familiar with the</font>

599
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,269
different DIY kids and the different

600
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,799
tools most<font color="#E5E5E5"> researchers even automated</font>

601
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,630
systems would say you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got</font>

602
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,330
infected by this malware family name

603
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,129
this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got infected again oh</font>

604
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:35,460
that's a different family it's not we

605
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:38,639
call this this and that so the naming

606
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,370
becomes screwed up but then if you

607
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:46,168
really take the time to peel<font color="#CCCCCC"> away all of</font>

608
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:48,000
those armoring that has been put in that

609
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,370
malware you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that once you</font>

610
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,509
reach the germ the germ is the pure

611
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,219
malware code unadulterated without any

612
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:58,470
protective mechanism you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

613
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,990
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the same like in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

614
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,389
day the samples you see like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50,000</font>

615
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:07,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">samples they all boil down to just one</font>

616
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">German so in the future hopefully</font>

617
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,149
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chart like that to</font>

618
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:14,820
identify uniqueness we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

619
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:17,459
get reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

620
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">millions and millions say this year we</font>

621
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,190
saw a 15-member families doing the

622
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,870
rounds and then about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next year and</font>

623
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,519
say we only saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten but these ten</font>

624
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,360
Mallard families are much more powerful

625
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,190
than the 15 that we saw last year and

626
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,070
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm are doing in</font>

627
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">RSA first watch is a trying to come up</font>

628
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,710
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a yearly report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

629
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,820
represents malware uniqueness based on

630
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,850
family<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not based on Ash all right</font>

631
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,460
easy malware update so unique samples

632
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">per malware deployment technology so</font>

633
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,529
what's a malleable deployment technology

634
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:57,870
so it's a technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that attackers used</font>

635
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:00,299
to have their creation reach the target

636
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,459
not really executing the target but just

637
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,769
reaching the target so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

638
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,899
popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> manual deployment technology we</font>

639
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:10,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drive-by download we have</font>

640
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:12,409
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also have USB sticks</font>

641
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,020
especially those that are given<font color="#E5E5E5"> away in</font>

642
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,790
Francis the one you have in your bag

643
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:20,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">soho make sure before you do anything</font>

644
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:27,159
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you plug it in to a ton air gap</font>

645
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:29,900
system so let's take for example email

646
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,700
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I have a botnet and that</font>

647
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,100
and then my botnet has the capability to

648
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,050
spam millions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions of samples</font>

649
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,110
but then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to target one</font>

650
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:42,220
company and that company has 50

651
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:46,030
employees so I would tell my botnet

652
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:49,010
create 50 spams targeting this company

653
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,450
now then the question is how do how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

654
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,340
get their email how they get their

655
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,230
information and all that I have to have

656
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:58,100
a blog written about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a in our</font>

657
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">say-so so let's say already have their</font>

658
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:05,120
email addresses so my botnet would

659
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,310
happily spam 50 email samples I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

660
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,060
50 emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those 50 employees within</font>

661
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:14,360
the company so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say one IT guy who</font>

662
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,190
is a security expert get that spam and

663
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,229
you say oh this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very obvious this is</font>

664
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,390
a spam mail and then you would send it a

665
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,130
security provider then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

666
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:25,100
provider and say you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a</font>

667
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:28,760
high paying customer so we'll give you a

668
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:30,439
solution in two hours but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

669
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remember that the way most security</font>

670
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,810
companies defined solution it's not

671
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,010
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution it's just detection</font>

672
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:39,290
when you say solution you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

673
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:43,640
completely eradicate the threat from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

674
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:45,590
system but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again given that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

675
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,540
sophistication of malware today they're

676
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,889
like the aliens in falling skies once

677
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,930
they embed themselves into the human

678
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">host taking them out kills the human</font>

679
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,860
host it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the with</font>

680
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,080
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes when you try to</font>

681
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,320
clean them up here you actually mess up

682
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,060
the whole operating system so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

683
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,669
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a solution in two</font>

684
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,310
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he gets the solution he deploys</font>

685
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,830
it to the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then he happily</font>

686
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:12,980
reports to the CTO hey don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about</font>

687
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam we got a couple of hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I</font>

688
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,790
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the solution have already</font>

689
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:21,560
deployed it were protected but then the

690
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:24,560
next day the network ad said hey I

691
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,789
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> were protected but according to</font>

692
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">my logs</font>

693
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I still see some information being</font>

694
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:34,779
exfiltrated out of our company so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

695
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:38,960
happened that or that happens because

696
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:40,759
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 email samples that were produced</font>

697
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">or that was spanked by the eat by the</font>

698
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:47,659
botnet it aptly contains 50 unique

699
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:50,059
malware samples so the one that was

700
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:53,179
caught by the security expert or the IT

701
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:56,359
security expert that sample you won't

702
00:31:53,179 --> 00:31:58,609
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it ever again you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only see it</font>

703
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,220
one time and the solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

704
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:03,739
deployed only sold that one sample it

705
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,769
didn't solve the other 49 samples that

706
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:08,840
were sent out with the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees</font>

707
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:11,059
that's why in the industry I really

708
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,249
don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in people would say</font>

709
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:16,039
hey we've analyzed this malware these

710
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:18,320
are the hashes because chances are you

711
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:22,009
wouldn't see those hashes ever again you

712
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,489
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> only see it once so one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

713
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:27,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">could happen that's why they became</font>

714
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:32,299
compromised probably one non technical

715
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:34,249
savvy user got that email was gullible

716
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:37,668
enough to follow whatever that email

717
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:40,429
said exok click the link execute the

718
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:43,099
file or whatever and that computer got

719
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:45,710
infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from that computer the</font>

720
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:49,039
infection spreads so that's what usually

721
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:51,440
happens so when you're when we're

722

<font color="#E5E5E5">a single malware alone we will now deal</font>

725
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,759
with different families of unique

726
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:06,349
malware and also when it comes to

727
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,859
malware serving domains it can rotate

728
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:12,289
malware in minutes so what's a malware

729
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:15,769

733
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:25,460
aptly influences how the matter behaves

734
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:27,559
in the system one is the domain drop

735
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,450
zone if it's an information stealing

736
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,149
malware all of the information it steals

737
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,759
it sends its out to that domain if it's

738
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:37,849
a primitive one probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it uses an</font>

another network resource that it use is

742
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,930

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,299
that attack component functions

756
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,120
depending on the directive of the

757
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,820
attacker if it's a if it's a DDoS attack

758
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,409
that attack component has the capability

759
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,150
to do details if it's an information

760

stealing attack that component is

761
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:32,210
probably a memory scraper a keylogger or

762
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,940
whatever and most importantly this is my

00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:38,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite I call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the Horcrux component</font>

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,820
so if you're fans of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter so a</font>

765
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:43,339
Horcrux component is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it checks the</font>

766
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,350
infected system from time to time to see

00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,050
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are components missing</font>

768
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,819
probably an incident responder came in

769
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,950
he remove one component thinking

770
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:54,050
everything's good but then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Horcrux</font>

771
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:56,359
component we say hey something's broken

772
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,460
so the Horcrux component would happily

773
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,350
rebuild it and sometimes the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

774
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,620
it needs are in the malware serving

775
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:07,120
domains so that's one one purpose of the

00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:11,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mallory serving domain now let's say</font>

777
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:14,089
Adam Albert the botnet or the malware

778
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,150
that infected the system uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Mallory</font>

00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,890
millions or even just thousands of

781
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,560
malware samples so a company would say

782
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,270
hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're infected basemen are</font>

783
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,870
very sophisticated and expensive

784
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:32,300
security product computer a is where the

785
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:35,680
infection is so an incident responder

786
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:38,600
would come there do forensics on

787
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,080
computer a and the end he finds out<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

788
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,290
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the sample so</font>

789
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,740
I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you tomorrow I'll send</font>

790
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:50,930
you the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can deploy so</font>

791
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,089
they deployed the solution it removed

792
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,319
the malware or detect

793
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,560
it and then they do the remediation

794
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,150
probably from backup or whatever but

795
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,970
then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next day the same network</font>

796
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:05,080
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad would say hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still</font>

797
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:08,290
data being excavated in our network now

798
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:10,180
that happens a lot because even if the

799
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:14,470
incident responder was able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

800
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:16,810
malware from that system in two hours or

801
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,419
in just minutes it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> already been</font>

802
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:21,160
updated by the attacker so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the</font>

803
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,250
incident responder was able to extract

804
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,009
from that system that's already old news

805
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,830
so even if he spends<font color="#E5E5E5"> days solving that</font>

806
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:32,590
sample that sample is not in the

807
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:34,410
infected machine anymore or or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

808
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,030
going the rounds in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network anymore</font>

809
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:40,000
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecially mallory serving domain so it</font>

810
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,580
will it will not be detected<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as</font>

811
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,770
an anomaly they would probably update it

812
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,069
once every day once every two hours

813
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:50,910
using disguising themselves as normal

814
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,900
traffic so if you have access to

815
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,810
thousands and thousands of malware

816
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,000
samples it's very easy to update the

817
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:04,630
sample in a compromised machine making

818
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,900
the attack very persistent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also to</font>

819
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:11,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abl so Mallory creation time</font>

820
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,810
versus solution cycle time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> mag</font>

821
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,030
recreation time as you would seem my

822
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,910
demo it just takes seconds that we

823
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,300
create one unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> mallory sample but</font>

824
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,310
then the solution cycle time you're

825
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,860
counting ours like when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in trend</font>

826
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:30,009
micro we were promising two hours of

827
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:36,130
detection or else we would pay you back

828
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:40,560
your money so seconds hours it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

829
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">loosening and for security vendors and</font>

830
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,440
AV evasion is effectively utilized

831
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,390
before when a sponsor if it's a state

832
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,260
sponsor or just a criminal underground

833
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,640
they want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that technology or in</font>

834
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,260
their malware when they're doing their

835
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,509
attack they would need to contact

836
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,410
directly the person who's an expert in

837
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,860
that technology but nowadays since we

838
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:09,370
don't have they don't have

839
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:14,320
they now use tools so sorry it messed me

840
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:16,480
up so so nowadays since the people get

841
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,830
arrested some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> get arrested they</font>

842
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,310
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be invited to the US and then they</font>

843
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:23,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">will get arrested the mother writers</font>

844
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">aptly what they did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is they try to have</font>

845
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,220
a buffer within the attacker group and

846
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,069
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there was now they're</font>

847
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying instead of you hiring me and</font>

848
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,270
knowing where to contact me how I look

849
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,910
like and all that how about you just buy

850
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,730
this tool located in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyper form and</font>

851
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:42,520
then send me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Western money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> union here</font>

852
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:45,670
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this state and then I'll have my</font>

853
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,560
money mules worry to me somewhere in in

854
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:53,800
Russia and then I'll give you a key so

855
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,720
that whatever functionality you need you

856
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,750
could have it you could unlock<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the</font>

857
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,700
tool and since all of the tools are

858
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,430
freely available and most attack

859
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,200
attacker groups have money if you have

860
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,839
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just get all of those tools</font>

861
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,580
and then all of the aviation technology

862
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,620
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are available today you could use</font>

863
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:17,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own attack campaign so that's</font>

864
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:20,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy it is nowadays and one is 21 a</font>

865
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,660
signature ratio so if the researcher<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

866
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,150
not smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough or is not aware enough</font>

867
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,640
about the tools to different tools

868
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,500
attackers use and the automated systems

869
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,970
they're using are not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

870
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough what happens is that they would</font>

871
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,890
end up creating one signature for one

872
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,240
malgor sample so if it's like 10,000

873
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,830
unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> mother samples they would create</font>

874
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,500
10,000 unique signatures when in fact

875
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:47,520
it's only one germ and this happens all

876
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,870
the time actually if you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

877
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,759
blacklist database that that's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

878
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Meg I would ask questions to my</font>

879
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,260
security provider because I usually if

880
00:39:54,310 --> 00:40:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have all of this it's in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the gigs</font>

881
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:02,500
and gigs but there was this

882
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,870
industry-wide project before which is

883
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">called pattern slimming so what happens</font>

884
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,740
there is that are all of the in the

885
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,290
world malware are only in the ones that

886
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,240
that's being deployed to the customers

887
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,529
what the gigs and gigs of data base are

888
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,100
the one that's being given<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

889
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,500
testers so you you would

890
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">magazine's 100 percent certified by this</font>

891
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,150
magazine one hundred percent passed this

892
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,770
test but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they're using a</font>

893
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,690
different set of signatures which is

894
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,700
gigs and gigs but in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

895
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,650
as a small portion because if you would

896
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,089
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get those gigs and gigs of data</font>

897
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,350
base you would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill the</font>

898
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,790
bandwidth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network when you</font>

899
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:39,540
deploy all of those solutions and

900
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:42,300
understanding the malware requires

901
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,529
reversing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just analysis now if</font>

902
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,780
you didn't want to understand the

903
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,910
malware you really need to reverse it

904
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,560
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis would reveal some</font>

905
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,740
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then I always believed</font>

906
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the school house is on fire and the</font>

907
00:40:52,740 --> 00:41:00,439
bank is getting robbed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

908
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:05,000
Mallory would exhibit the most obvious

909
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,530
the most obvious of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most obvious</font>

910
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,970
behavior but then again you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

911
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to reverse it that's why most of the</font>

912
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:14,040
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come out they would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

913
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,240
out like six months eight months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

914
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,009
the fact because that's the amount of

915
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,470
time that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took them directly under</font>

916
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,000
standard member like for me if I have a

917
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,009
reversing project if it's a very

918
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,600
sophisticated sophisticated malware it

919
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,750
takes me weeks even months<font color="#CCCCCC"> toughly</font>

920
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,319
reverse that manner so reversing is

921
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:35,790
easier said than<font color="#CCCCCC"> done all right so we</font>

922
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:37,950
only have two minutes so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

923
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:43,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">create malware this is in real time and</font>

924
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:45,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a slowing using a very slow</font>

925
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,730
system so here we would use Zeus so

926
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,690
everything is pre-configured you just

927
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:53,190
need to turn it on your automated

928
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,050
scripts and all that and then it could

929
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,090
create samples for you the one on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

930
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,060
right you would see dis created one

931
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,650
sample now if you have if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have kids</font>

932
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,390
you can watch your kids baseball game

933
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,720
basketball game come back and see

934
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,520
thousands and thousands of malware if if

935
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,319
you work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government you have</font>

936
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,820
this running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your government office</font>

937
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,550
the government shuts down you got

938
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,660
furloughed come back after 16 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

939
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,360
would still be running and you would

940
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,129
have thousands and thousands of malware

941
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,750
so that's how easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is to create</font>

942
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter samples well I was explaining</font>

943
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,100
that it already created eight unique

944
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">mallory samples now when I say unique</font>

945
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,368
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not unique in hash it's unique</font>

946
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just juice so behavior</font>

947
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:36,630
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same across the board but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

948
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,129
how it looks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and in memory is</font>

949
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,750
totally different from one generation to

950
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,880
another now so if you're not familiar

951
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,960
with the kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would say it's a</font>

952
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,610
different family all together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

953
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you add armoring it messes things up</font>

954
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this armoring it does is it doesn't</font>

955
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,940
use time and data succeed it uses random

956
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,740
keys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

957
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,740
combinations is in billions and

958
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,810
trillions so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still like having</font>

959
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:03,000
infinite amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware sample this</font>

960
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:05,759
one also has added features it has anti

961
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,480
sandbox technology and all that cool

962
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,880
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I would explain how they got</font>

963
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,619
the idea for the randomization but if

964
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,960
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are interested you can always</font>

965
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,670
approach me because it's a 30 minute

966
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,440
explanation but if you guys are really

967
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,410
interested please feel free to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send me a</font>

968
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,090
message so this one it already from one

969
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:29,730
sample from that DIY kit it already

970
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:31,260
created three samples<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font>

971
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it together an automated system</font>

972
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,780
attackers use just get a bare metal

973
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,119
system you get the virtualized machine

974
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,400
with the Caped<font color="#CCCCCC"> breathalyze</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine with</font>

975
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,200
the armory tools you have shared folders

976
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,000
all the kit although samples produced by

977
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Katie dropping that folder from that</font>

978
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,700
folder drop it from to the armory tools

979
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,590
vm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from there it drops all of the</font>

980
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,020
finished samples and<font color="#E5E5E5"> armored samples</font>

981
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,790
folder now all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these can be automated</font>

982
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,680
in the bare metal machine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by using</font>

983
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,680
agents that actually monitor the

984
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,210
different folders and then once you have

985
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,310
all your armored samples to sit back

986
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,300
enjoy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fruits of your labor labor</font>

987
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:10,950
sell it use it to conduct an attack and

988
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,450
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but I'm</font>

989
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,868
not saying you guys do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is all</font>

990
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:18,810
for educational purposes and all the

991
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:21,150
samples are destroyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> after all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

992
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,580
experiments just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

993
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:28,630
camera gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information</font>

994
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:31,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaways the real story behind it</font>

995
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:34,000
usually is just a handful of kids

996
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,860
responsible for a for the millions and

997
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,619
millions and samples we see every year

998
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:40,030
and the way they do it they are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

999
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:42,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">produce those number of samples using</font>

1000
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,650
automation and if you have security

1001
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,780
providers ask the right questions so not

1002
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,310
don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take their word for it ask</font>

1003
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,750
the right questions now if they're going

1004
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,880
to conduct demonstrations within your

1005
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,980
company don't let them conduct demo

1006
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,080
using their own samples you have to have

1007
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,520
samples of your own probably samples

1008
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,590
that you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect in your</font>

1009
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,000
own network or samples you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1010
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:03,910
collect from industry contacts and then

1011
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them try that because those samples</font>

1012
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:09,009
those samples you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> there usually</font>

1013
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,540
represent real world scenario and a new

1014
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,390
solution is needed so signature less

1015
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:15,009
detection so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually working on one</font>

1016
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,750
solution right now utilizing machine

1017
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,710
learning it's a year-long project

1018
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:24,790
hopefully it works so I won't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fired</font>

1019
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:27,130
and instead of analyzing the Malheur

1020
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,770
samples themselves we need to go after

1021
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,440
the tools and not the creation analyzed

1022
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:34,330
reverse engineer the tools reverse

1023
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,119
engineer the kids but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then again it's</font>

1024
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:39,520
easier said than<font color="#CCCCCC"> done attackers realize</font>

1025
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,130
this that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're tools and their</font>

1026
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,500
kids also have protective mechanisms it

1027
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,470
takes a long when I say long sometimes

1028
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,090
years to happily understand one kid now

1029
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,830
if it's leaked out their source code

1030
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:54,609
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lab because you just need to</font>

1031
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:56,109
read in English so which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good so if</font>

1032
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're so inclined please feel free to</font>

1033
00:45:56,109 --> 00:46:00,190
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a standing ovation this was</font>

1034
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:03,970
taken in my previous talk they were real

1035
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,680
audience from my previous top so again

1036
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,779
if you have budget please buy the book

1037
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,960
it's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my kids college fund follow me</font>
