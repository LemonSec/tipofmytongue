1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:25,280
so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I'm Matt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Johansson i work</font>

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,959
at whitehat security so you have any

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,520
reason to<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe what I say this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,970
what we do or an application security

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,410
company we are software as a service web

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,910
scanner basically all we do is hack

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,010
websites day in day out find

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,360
vulnerabilities in them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind</font>

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data I bring to the table I think</font>

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just past twenty thousand websites</font>

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,600
under your service that our data pool

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,430
comes from when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I originally gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,110
presentation i gave it with Jeremiah

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,640
Grossman so I left this slide in to kind

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of give him a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hat tip you know if you</font>

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,740
did he did part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this research like he</font>

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,030
needs my hat tip right but his bullet

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,270
points are slightly more impressive than

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,710
mine but as as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intrud introduction</font>

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,720
said yeah I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done this speaking thing</font>

21
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,400
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times but the more important</font>

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,500
bullet that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to announce here is</font>

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,729
I'm hiring a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an office in</font>

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,530
Houston if you're looking for an

25
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,000
entry-level web how come job come see me

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,500
afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll leave with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font>

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about browser</font>

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,100
security so who thinks the web is broken

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">well you're all here come on everyone</font>

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,990
goes ahead ok ok cool so the the way the

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,300
web works is you know inherently kind of

32
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,100
flawed write a few ways so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,289
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to breeze through the first part of</font>

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,880
my talk here just because this is an

35
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:33,770
application security conference you guys

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,600
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of a lot of things about</font>

37
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,100
to say I'm sucking the touch on them but

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,759
i'll try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

39
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,110
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all heard of CSRs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> csrf xss</font>

40
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,149
if you haven't please excuse me I'm

41
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,399
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly past them so you know if</font>

42
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we got cross-site scripting</font>

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,819
into a web page anywhere right we can

44
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,589
have our JavaScript malware and here's a

45
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,140
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

46
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,940
nothing new this is stuff that

47
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,610
javascript-based malware can perform

48
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,050
right research much smarter that

49
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,140
researchers much smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than me have</font>

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,840
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics such as tada right</font>

51
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:13,430
so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going to focus on a</font>

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,920
lot of of these but what we did and in

53
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,030
our research really focuses on the the

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,920
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two so yeah you see that a little</font>

55
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,090
bit later but let's go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,380
each real quick so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all things</font>

57
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,090
that javascript-based malware can do

58
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,109
to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keep that in mind as I go as</font>

59
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,210
I go through this right so you've all

60
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,230
heard of CNN here's a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> little get</font>

61
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,210
request that I saw this is an actual URL

62
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,070
that is sent to CNN I wasn't packing

63
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,430
them or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a URL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,430
choose to send to themselves to gather

65
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,310
some metrics on browser interrogation

66
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:54,180
what kind of stuff do we see in there we

67
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,340
see your operating system we see your

68
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,150
you know just your user agent oh you're

69
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,250
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox you're on a Mac you came</font>

70
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,930
from here you clicked this click that

71
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,930
now you're here there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other</font>

72
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,370
thing right where it fingerprinting your

73
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,200
browser so we have a better picture of

74
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">who you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while you're on our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,310
all this kind of stuff this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how the</font>

76
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,870
web works great right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

77
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of information out of this there's</font>

78
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,050
actually an eff project that I can never

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,860
remember the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is it someone</font>

80
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,740
on to talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser</font>

81
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,660
fingerprinting project to shout it out

82
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,160
how to optic that's it right thank you

83
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,120
so there's a browser fingerprinting

84
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,640
project it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unique fingerprint</font>

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,290
of your browser that can be made just by

86
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,579
you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the website right they have</font>

87
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">control over your browser while you're</font>

88
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,520
there they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out the plugins</font>

89
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,989
you have installed the date you

90
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,030
installed them the date you installed

91
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,000
your actual browser all this leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:51,150
one significantly unique hash of who you

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,150
are right then there's things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF</font>

94
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,280
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript can force you to do</font>

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,110
so if I'm i have my javascript in your

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,910
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can dynamically create all</font>

97
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,310
these image tags it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy way</font>

98
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,920
to do some cool see us or have stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

99
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,240
can force you to hack another side hey I

100
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,829
know there's the sequel injection in

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,300
this site I don't feel like hacking it

102
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,590
why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I force you to hack it for me</font>

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I'll get the data back cool</font>

104
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'm not involved right that's our</font>

105
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">first example right there you can force</font>

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,540
people to download<font color="#E5E5E5"> torrents get the</font>

107
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,608
months all sorts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lists and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble</font>

108
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,040
or you know let's get justin bieber fan

109
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:27,450
club trending on google for whatever

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,370
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it the you pull a weave</font>

111
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,659
right you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen this in the</font>

112
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,780
news<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it lets enumerate some</font>

113
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,070
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you IDs and</font>

114
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,840
and try to collect some<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that way</font>

115
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,540
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to go to jail so I'll</font>

116
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">make you do it or let's cast a vote if</font>

117
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,630
someone's still enough to have a vote as

118
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,760
a get request which I've never seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

119
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,700
so login detection another thing we do

120
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,320
at javascript right so there's a I think

121
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,520
there's six techniques does that say

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's on that slide 6</font>

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,539
techniques to that are known to kind of

124
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,980
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some login detection to figure out</font>

125
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,960
what other websites you're currently

126
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,860
logged into while you're on my website

127
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,109
right so a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy one is is that</font>

128
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,180
that top line right there you can again

129
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,520
create an image tag make a call out to

130
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,040
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> site right so say you know there</font>

131
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a picture on a site some image file</font>

132
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,220
that is only accessible while logged in

133
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,630
to that application right so let's

134
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,550
request that image and we'll do an

135
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,860
onload event right if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that image loads</font>

136
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,240
successfully fire some function that

137
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,450
lets me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're logged in if</font>

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,740
that image errors you're not logged in

139
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,090
as simple as that right so if you find

140
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the image if you can get to it you're</font>

141
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,700
logged in all things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are how the</font>

142
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,370
web is supposed to work right<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so</font>

143
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,620
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this valuable to anyone right so</font>

144
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,030
if you're running if I'm running my

145
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,250
javascript in your browser and I know

146
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,780
you're logged in to some of their site

147
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,270
what else does<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript have access to</font>

148
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:56,039
you someone scream it okay what else the

149
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,000
cookies thank you someone give that guy

150
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">a cookie yeah so if I know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,240
logged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your bank in another tab and</font>

152
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,739
you're on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> website what else does</font>

153
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript I have access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the cookie</font>

154
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,250
for that Bank I can take over your your

155
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,169
identity in your bank no problem right

156
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,570
so logging detection really helps Taylor

157
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,740
what kind of attack are going to do with

158
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript we can de anonymize you</font>

159
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,370
Jeremiah did a bunch of blog post called

160
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,409
the I know series like what i know about

161
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you if you come to my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage use some</font>

162
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,050
some techniques such as clickjacking

163
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,190
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already told you a bunch of</font>

164
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff that we know about you because i</font>

165
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,320
can interrogate your browser right I can

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,180
geolocation OS type all that kind of

167
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,909
stuff but if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to click even</font>

168
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,650
once I can float all three of these

169
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">buttons on top of each other a twitter</font>

170
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,340
follow button

171
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,410
button<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a plus one Google</font>

172
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,140
button make them invisible make them

173
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,630
follow your follow your mouse so any

174
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">time you click once on my webpage you</font>

175
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,500
send out all these requests so I know

176
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,990
your real name your twitter name your

177
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

178
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,170
any of the information that's also that

179
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,969
you choose to put on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook page</font>

180
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,440
right so now all of a sudden instead of

181
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,270
just some browser and operating system

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">information i actually know who you are</font>

183
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,070
all right at least who you are as you're

184
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,000
logged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to any of those three services</font>

185
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:17,820
right we can do intranet packing okay so

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,140
yeah like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a patch to</font>

187
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,630
this internal website because its

188
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,090
internal facing only well incorrect

189
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,520
right so if I get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to my web</font>

190
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">page and again do some iframe or image</font>

191
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,710
source request to 192 168 address that

192
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,750
request is going to go through just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine</font>

193
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,909
melts and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start accessing your</font>

194
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,000
internet internal facing on the

195
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,920
applications from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and force</font>

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,830
your computer to do it for me and start

197
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,870
start hacking there I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can force you to</font>

198
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,460
xss this is similar to the forcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

199
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,470
sequel it showed on an earlier slide I

200
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,789
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cross-site scripting attack I</font>

201
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,740
don't want to send that cross site

202
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,450
scripting attack let's force it<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

203
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,760
send that Cup site scripting attack and

204
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,370
see it steal all these cookies and

205
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,900
sessions and things like that then

206
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,630
there's traditional malware right so we

207
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,580
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this lot so drive-by</font>

208
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,110
downloads like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you come to my site I'm</font>

209
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,469
hosting malware on it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

210
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,000
some sort of browser exploit or plugin

211
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,130
that you're using and exploit that to

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,419
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> force you to download some bad</font>

213
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,040
malware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have control</font>

214
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">over your actual machine right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm</font>

215
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,790
breaking out of the browser and making

216
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,340
you download download some malware

217
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,890
what's everyone's favorite way to get

218
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this onto your computer last word on the</font>

219
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:33,270
slide right uninstall it please yeah so

220
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,520
pat pat pat uninstalling yeah so a java

221
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,020
java shooting fish in a barrel kind of

222
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,569
thing with when it comes to drive by

223
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,640
malware in browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 days but again this</font>

224
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just another thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do to your</font>

225
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,870
computer if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to my website</font>

226
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,880
because it's how the web works so here's

227
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,680
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> two are what we're going to</font>

228
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of focus on and what we focused on</font>

229
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,859
in our research when it comes to

230
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,040
our bond that which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> promise I'll get</font>

231
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,410
to you soon so<font color="#CCCCCC"> some we could do some</font>

232
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,790
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> well distributing quotes if</font>

233
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,519
you come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my website I can force your</font>

234
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,410
browser to do some hash cracking for me

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,630
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research has actually been</font>

236
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,269
done again by someone much smarter than

237
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and he actually proved that</font>

238
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:14,760
javascript is really fast at doing this

239
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a single browser they got up to</font>

240
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,610
100,000 md5 hashes per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

241
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,310
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious number from one browser</font>

242
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,860
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we distribute our JavaScript</font>

243
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,239
malware that now<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're cracking a</font>

244
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,420
lot of hashes pretty quickly this is a

245
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,160
pretty serious half cracking botnet that

246
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,709
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> build or whatever you want to call</font>

247
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,689
it so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a tool online you</font>

248
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:36,699
can all go<font color="#E5E5E5"> check this out some links at</font>

249
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,550
the bottom I know it's kind of small but

250
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:42,189
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool is ravaughn and it uses in</font>

251
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,779
your browser uses html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> web workers</font>

252
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,990
anyone familiar with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font>

253
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of maybe no ok so what web workers</font>

254
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,730
are allowing you to do is use multiple

255
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,500
processes in a single browser to kind of

256
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,130
send these requests and and do these

257
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,610
sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so browsers can</font>

258
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,949
send out six simultaneous requests web

259
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,079
worker adds a seventh and using these

260
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,849
web workers you can kind of harvest the

261
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU time and actually start cracking</font>

262
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,440
these these hashes so you see each of

263
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,240
these web workers each of these boxes is

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">worker if you scroll down on this</font>

265
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,680
website you'll see like six<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

266
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so worker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero worker one and each</font>

267
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them are doing about was that sixty</font>

268
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,959
to seventy thousand hashes per second

269
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,519
per web worker smell of a sudden you're

270
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,959
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit faster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for browser</font>

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,730
it's really just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit of how fast</font>

272
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,109
that computer in that browser is that

273
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,680
you can start cracking cracking

274
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,569
passwords and then there's the main one

275
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,839
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on is distributed</font>

276
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,839
to service right so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross origin</font>

277
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,750
requests again from web workers a

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,589
browser can actually send a ton<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get</font>

279
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,839
requests relatively quickly and and kind

280
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:55,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">of flood another web server with</font>

281
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,010
connections so think of this this isn't

282
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">a traditional denial of service attack</font>

283
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,110
that you hear about and reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news</font>

284
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,390
we're not measuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

285
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,370
analysis attack in gigs per second or

286
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,020
anything we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to send as</font>

287
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,209
much data as possible we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

288
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">send as many requests as possible right</font>

289
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:13,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you see this TC it's trying to hold</font>

290
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,680
up hold open a lot of TCP requests and

291
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,010
just fires tons and tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia press</font>

292
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,170
synchronously again that same researcher

293
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,420
has published a ton of research on that

294
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,599
and if he got his up to about 10,000

295
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,910
requests per minute from one browser

296
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,170
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad right so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned this</font>

297
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:36,199
connection limit so each each of the

298
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,229
modern browsers allows roughly six

299
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,959
simultaneous connections from one

300
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,770
browser at any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given time to a given</font>

301
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,899
hostname right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually not a</font>

302
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,050
security reason this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a</font>

303
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,490
performance reason they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you</font>

304
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,439
know this website waiting forever to

305
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,000
load you know the thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> images if</font>

306
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,620
someone chose<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a thousand images on</font>

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,850
some site or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

308
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,950
do six at a time and they kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

309
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,110
chip away at the science of performance

310
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,940
thing some mobile browsers you can get

311
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">like eight there's this website called</font>

312
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,730
browser scope you can go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> check this</font>

313
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,160
out whatever browser you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and you</font>

314
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,540
can see all the connections that it can

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">make out at any given time so that</font>

316
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,380
middle column is what we're talking

317
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,069
about connections per host name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64</font>

318
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,380
all modern browsers so what I went a

319
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:26,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">little too far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we figured out how</font>

320
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:28,880
to bypass that in Firefox at least so

321
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,649
for those of you who kind of can read

322
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,240
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript this isn't I hope this</font>

323
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,579
isn't you know too<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated code or</font>

324
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,200
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually you know fairly</font>

325
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:41,209
fairly simple code why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I choose to write</font>

326
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,300
this in JavaScript on the left you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

327
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:47,119
kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for loop right so I'm</font>

328
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:51,620
dynamically creating image tags and I'm

329
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,140
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok please send out a request per</font>

330
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,110
image tag to this given<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL and iterate</font>

331
00:12:54,140 --> 00:13:00,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">through I yadda yadda so how we actually</font>

332
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:05,380
bypassed it is not sending it via HTTP

333
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,790
we send it via FTP to port<font color="#CCCCCC"> gate so</font>

334
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,240
Firefox doesn't care anymore there's no

335
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">6 connection limit there's no limit at</font>

336
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,529
all

337
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,110
it's not like it hits a different limit

338
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:20,339
there is no limit so I'm a little demo

339
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:24,060
video I know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I'm I'm lame</font>

340
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:28,740
but demo gods aren't usually very kind

341
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:35,069
to me let's try to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolutions all</font>

342
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:37,740
screwed up no you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go full</font>

343
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:41,630
time low full screen on me there that's

344
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,810
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what you can see here is</font>

345
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:48,570
a simple apache server status page<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

346
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,040
running apache server this a can't

347
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,020
remember if this one was local<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn you</font>

348
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,410
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> two but we did it in both local and</font>

349
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,970
in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazon and you can see the the</font>

350
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,010
terminal would love it I'm refreshing

351
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,720
every one second refreshing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> status</font>

352
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">page every one second just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can see</font>

353
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,160
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with the Apache web</font>

354
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,099
server and then on the bottom left you

355
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,569
can see the can everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make</font>

356
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,450
out these numbers in the bottom left are

357
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,580
they big enough from the big screen the

358
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,740
number i really would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on</font>

359
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,800
is that one request currently being

360
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,450
processed so that's that's kind of the

361
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,069
simultaneous requests one request

362
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,430
currently being process is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

363
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,270
Refresh right so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna watch that</font>

364
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,459
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm and yeah you can see this is</font>

365
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">just me proven by log is actually</font>

366
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:36,750
refreshing and here's the code I wrote

367
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,459
same code is on the slide I've I have a

368
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,680
for loop all I've three four loops are

369
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:42,150
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 it out though I'm going to do this</font>

370
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
top for loop I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually add</font>

371
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,540
some numbers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the loop I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

372
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamically create that many image tags</font>

373
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm enough to</font>

374
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,410
create 100 image tags I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit</font>

375
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see they're going to</font>

376
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,600
come back see that number 127 so one is

377
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,920
for the refresh and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> six is is for</font>

378
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,170
the images<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll see these images</font>

379
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,719
come back six at a time and I have a

380
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,849
weight in between here so just you know

381
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can kind of see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's going on so</font>

382
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing six at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a time these images</font>

383
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,890
come back you kind of get the idea right

384
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,800
but that's seven from one browser well

385
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,720
it's actually six to one post but yeah I

386
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,109
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what that was but just been</font>

387
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">up 44 but uh now we're going to go ahead</font>

388
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do the same exact code</font>

389
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,270
but all I changed was instead of http we

390
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:33,650
did ftp to port 80<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so let's</font>

391
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,390
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what number I do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

392
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:39,020
the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache numbers right around</font>

393
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,210
300 with the for loop so 20 I don't want

394
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,360
to kill it yet see that went immediately

395
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:47,800
21 right 21 request simultaneously being

396
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,660
processed from one browser to two Apache

397
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,469
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of proves we bypassed the</font>

398
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:56,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">six thing but what what if we wanted to</font>

399
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,300
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down our Apache blog you can see in</font>

400
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,540
their logs here so we kind of found that

401
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,310
the magic number for the root for the

402
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,199
loop is 400 and the magic number for

403
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:11,000
Apache to stop responding to my server

404
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:14,180
requests is 260 something 266 requests

405
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,060
being processed 279 I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to refresh</font>

406
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,160
and as this video kind of goes towards

407
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,390
the end here it stops refreshing you

408
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,490
guys get the point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one browser</font>

409
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,460
i doused my own impact like just default

410
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,240
patchy install running locally so that

411
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:33,230
was pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay do we think</font>

412
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,140
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool kind of das myself can't get</font>

413
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it anymore yeah you see it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

414
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,220
spinning down here in the bottom server

415
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:44,060
one second her time is just it's just

416
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:46,910
stuff I'm 279<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what can I do</font>

417
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:54,439
with this cool piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information what</font>

418
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:56,270
would you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back okay so what</font>

419
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the benefits to hacking this</font>

420
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,120
way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know via JavaScript distributed</font>

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,260
JavaScript<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right forcing other</font>

422
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,699
people's browsers to do your bidding

423
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,569
right so there's really nothing to

424
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,880

425
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,409
popped the browser I've and left the

426
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,000
trace I just kind of ran some javascript

427
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,400
in your browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there's few</font>

do at any given time this is how the web

432
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,329
is supposed to work right I'm not you

433
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,178
know being delete hacks are up here and

434
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,190
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know writing some Eau de and popping</font>

435
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,780
boxes or anything like that whatever the

436
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,260
kids are<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying these days I'm actually</font>

437
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,610
just writing JavaScript so you know it's

438
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,140
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy you saw the few lines</font>

439
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,149
of code that I have right thing I mean I

440
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,700
could teach anyone to write those few

441
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,400
lines of code it's really but how do we

442
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,110
distribute this malware right so here's

443
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,270
some traditional ways of distributing

444
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,649
javascript javascript base malware right

445
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,850
so you have cross-site scripting you

446
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,410
want to start hacking a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

447
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,709
what do you do what's the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you</font>

448
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:58,660
do on this list which which one do you

449
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,610
guys think is most prominent like on the

450
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet today like what most people do</font>

451
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,129
if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start hacking people</font>

452
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,330
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript to scream now I just</font>

453
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to i'm just curious what you guys</font>

454
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:15,669
think is the most popular distribution

455
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,320
method guys cut stop screaming search

456
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:20,080
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> poisoning all right what was</font>

457
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,240
going on I heard web widgets that's a

458
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,639
good one right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most popular</font>

459
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,520
one is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> email spam all right I</font>

460
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,730
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all deal with that a lot and</font>

461
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,440
and you know email spam phishing attacks

462
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,390
but but any one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these right we've</font>

463
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,210
seen these time and time again these hit

464
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,290
the headlines you know that the top one

465
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,110
right so you have you already have a

<font color="#CCCCCC">high traffic site that's kind of shady</font>

467
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,479
you want to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own JavaScript down</font>

468
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,060
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get them to start doing</font>

469
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,760
stuff or I found cross-site scripting in

470
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,860
a popular site that was persistent you

471

code is to buy an ad all right well

482
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,720
let's do that cool so how do you buy

483
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,460
that so so as you don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,940
the advert test advertising network

485
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,260
ecosystem works right very rarely does

486
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,180
someone who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advertise on a</font>

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,680
like advertise on your website here's

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,360
money here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my ADD pls display this ad</font>

492
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,060
works i'm sure there are some outliers

493
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,710
but how it usually works is the people

494
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,200
who would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to advertise go to an</font>

495
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,760
advert

496
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,340
network which is kind of the middleman

497
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,309
in the operation and they give them

498
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,459
money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ads and then that</font>

499
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:57,289
Network has some sort of collection of

500
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,730
we're going to call them publishers just

501
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites that they're going to push these</font>

502
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,260
ads out onto and then you know people

503
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to those sites and that's it right</font>

504
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it separates the advertiser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shum from</font>

505
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">the direct publishers so here are some</font>

506
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,820
popular ad networks I had to distinguish

507
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,799
that based on this template it kind of

508
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,178
look yeah we caught this when we were

509
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,990
doing our dry run that it looked like

510
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:23,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">white hat was part of the blob but we</font>

511
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,260
are not of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so you guys</font>

512
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:25,690
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of some of these you</font>

513
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,010
might not have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of these</font>

514
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:31,429
google adsense and double click or

515
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most popular ones the</font>

516
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:36,500
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> most popular with if you've ever</font>

517
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,179
watched any web traffic ever via any

518
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,799
method of you watching web traffic

519
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:43,309
you've definitely seen double click

520
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:44,658
request go out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> double-click but so</font>

521
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other thing that we want to focus on</font>

522
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:51,279
here is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these allow third-party</font>

523
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript what could go wrong right and</font>

524
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,159
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them don't right so we wanted to</font>

525
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:58,669
focus our research on the ones that that

526
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,139
did but we said okay here's some more

527
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:02,690
popular ones that don't allow javascript

528
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:04,158
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just write them and see if hey if</font>

529
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,039
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask nicely will they let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me put</font>

530
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,799
javascript in there and this is the

531
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,899
email that but Jeremiah got back that we

532
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,399
thought was kind of funny I'll be rollin

533
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:15,620
easy a but never to said hey you know

534
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:17,959
we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy an ad we'd like to</font>

535
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,518
include our own JavaScript in that ad we

536
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,380
promise we won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything bad yada</font>

537
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,610
yada something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is the</font>

538
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,610
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to excrete it for</font>

539
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Batum because I think it's hilarious so</font>

540
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,500
he said yeah the only third-party code

541
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:32,330
we allow is from large ads serving

542
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,120
companies like double click and such who

543
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:37,428
we trust let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a warm and fuzzy</font>

544
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,870
feeling that they trust each other yeah

545
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,610
they're definitely already scanning

546
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,168
their side to prevent vulnerabilities so

547
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,320
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to worry about Yeah Yeah</font>

548
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:48,440
right who thinks that's you know

549
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,668
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong yeah okay so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

550
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,230
thought that was kind of funny but I

551
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:52,169
figured if we showed up with enough

552
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,820
money and asked enough

553
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:55,200
people nicely that even in the ad

554
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,149
networks that don't publicize that they

555
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,249
allow javascript probably would have

556
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:02,850
some method of allowing us to to write

557
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:04,769
our JavaScript into the app so there's

558
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,809
another type of network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to</font>

559
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,369
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it an ad network that we utilized</font>

560
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:11,700
in this research<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

561
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:14,549
of distributed browser methodology so

562
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,850
this network allows you to just buy

563
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:20,249
browser minutes right so the important

564
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,529
distinction here so yes we go here

565
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:27,090
10,000 minutes is about 12 12 and a half

566
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:29,070
bucks and that's 10,000 minutes browser

567
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,488
time you just give them a URL and they

568
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:34,289
will guarantee that some browsers some

569
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:36,330
collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> browsers somewhere will</font>

570
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:39,629
collectively spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 minutes just</font>

571
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,879
on that URL right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

572
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:43,619
legitimate website<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm like really</font>

573
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:44,998
having a hard time finding legitimate

574
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:48,389
reasons for your service like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

575
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:50,580
exist but it exists the other way to

576
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:52,590
kind of get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network like this or</font>

577
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,289
get minutes to use that of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

578
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:58,980
like this is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> offer your browser up to</font>

579
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:01,619
like as a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will sit on</font>

580
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">websites and you know all you offer your</font>

581
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:08,100
browser time you get browser time back

582
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:09,359
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing right so kind of the yeah</font>

583
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,559
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will get two will get two more</font>

584
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this later but the important part</font>

585
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,399
between this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad network is that the</font>

586
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,918
ad network doesn't guarantee any time

587
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,479
that the ad is going to be on the web

588
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,789
page right it guarantees that the ad

589
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,080
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a browser but it doesn't</font>

590
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:23,639
guarantee how long that ad will stay

591
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,739
there so for things like the hash

592
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,959
cracking right<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can i do</font>

593
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,450
per second that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript running</font>

594
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the entire time the ad is</font>

595
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,039
loaded but that lad could be up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

596
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,149
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two seconds or that ad could you</font>

597
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,309
know someone could load a webpage and

598
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,199
you know walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some food or</font>

599
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,600
something and then it's just loading

600
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,850
four minutes right this guarantees that

601
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right there is no that you're going</font>

602
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get this many browser minutes 4 12</font>

603
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:51,359
and a half dollars right so just so you

604
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:54,779
know in our research we never ran out of

605
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,340
those 10,000 minutes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate so we've</font>

606
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,919
only ever given them both and a half

607
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,539
dollars so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

608
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to focus on focus on these</font>

609
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,440
last couple here in our research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

610
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,630
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually went</font>

611
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,520
and did this right so I went actually

612
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,930
purchased an ad out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that network that</font>

613
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,060
allowed me to write my javascript in it

614
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:13,620
and let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do right so</font>

615
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,990
the important part that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

616
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on here for you guys listening for</font>

617
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of the talk is the economics of</font>

618
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:24,030
this so how like ad network lingo and

619
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,890
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how they price it out is cost</font>

620
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,250
per impression or cost per thousand

621
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,770
impressions rather so that varies

622
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,990
anywhere from pennies to a few dollars

623
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,520
but the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used that allowed us</font>

624
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,980
throughout our JavaScript was fifty

625
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,930
cents per thousand impressions when I

626
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,720
say impressions I want all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you to</font>

627
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,640
think browsers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay guess that's that's</font>

628
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,650
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right impression is every</font>

629
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
time that add loads in a browser it's

630
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,000
executing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript rights that is a</font>

631
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,950
browser that is a bot in my botnet as

632
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,530
far as I'm concerned so it's 50 cents

633
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,840
per thousand of them so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your million</font>

634
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,550
browser botnet using some really awesome

635
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,730
math I learned in elementary school

636
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:05,340
that's five hundred dollars so yeah this

637
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:08,040
is a pretty economic way of doing things

638
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,560
and I kind of wanted a proof of concept

639
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:14,190
to see if it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually legitimately</font>

640
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,710
generate some a lot of traffic and let's

641
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,530
do a distributed denial service attack

642
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,200
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the here's some screenshots</font>

643
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:24,210
from the actual admin panel of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ad</font>

644
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,750
network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really has anyone</font>

645
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,550
ever done this is anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ad networks</font>

646
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,550
besides Google and like bought ads just

647
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">curious yeah one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not too</font>

648
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,820
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you right I didn't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

649
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,420
had never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weird</font>

650
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,100
world of advertising right they let you

651
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,900
get very granular obviously they didn't

652
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">they there at this panel was not</font>

653
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,340
designed for someone like me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and</font>

654
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,990
try to buy an ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I didn't care</font>

655
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">about at all I just cared about the</font>

656
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,440
JavaScript running in browsers so there

657
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,810
was a lot of things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

658
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,890
through that I like could not<font color="#E5E5E5"> care less</font>

659
00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:01,350
about like keywords and geolocation and

660
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,060
you know campaign titles and there's a

661
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,980
lot of lingo I had to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

662
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,860
they were talking about but anyway

663
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,060
here's here's some screenshots from it

664
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,760
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me thrown a few</font>

665
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,020
bucks at it just to kick the tire and

666
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
see if I could see the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

667
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,110
other side I wasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do</font>

668
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,880
and yet you guys can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you throw money</font>

669
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,520
in this thing you say okay you're

670
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,900
allowed to use this much money per day

671
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,270
go right go on this campaign you can

672
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">create multiple campaigns you can target</font>

673
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:32,179
multiple audiences so you can see at

674
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:34,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point you know I had put you know</font>

675
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:38,120
somewhere near 30 or 40 bucks in it I

676
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:39,890
said you know use<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 bucks a day and you</font>

677
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,989
know today I had 16,000 depressions

678
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,510
really funny part is this graph on the

679
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,400
bottom here kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of breaks down how many</font>

680
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,590
impressions you got per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the cliq</font>

681
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,059
conversion rate which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also didn't care</font>

682
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,959
about but the first time I ever turn

683
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:55,100
this thing on I got 15 clicks wasn't

684
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,750
even trying to get clicks I'll show you

685
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,520
guys the ad in a second it's gonna be

686
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,770
really funny once you see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but people</font>

687
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,030
actually clicked my ad that's way more

688
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,590
dangerous right if people clicked on it

689
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,760
you can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts of stuff I didn't</font>

690
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">even care if people are clicking on it</font>

691
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,379
right but here's another cool part again

692
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:15,320
of this admin panel this was unique to

693
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,299
well not very unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unique to</font>

694
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,730
the advertising networks that allow

695
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:21,168
javascript have something like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

696
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,780
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either just give them an image</font>

697
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:24,980
and a URL you say hey put this image in

698
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,899
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and when you click it it's</font>

699
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to this URL or in this ad</font>

700
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:34,669
network they said here's a box write

701
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:37,429
your code tada my trick I did okay yeah

702
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,929
nothing too crazy here so at first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

703
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,080
just writing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript straight you</font>

704
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:43,520
know into this box but there actually is

705
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,470
an approval process that you're ahead

706
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,210
has to go through right so really really

707
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,760
strenuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> train</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> euless there's a blood</font>

708
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:52,100
test involves you know you do also a

709
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,530
hair sample know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there is</font>

710
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,350
an approval process but they could I

711
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,780
mean they had no idea what JavaScript

712
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,750
even was I don't think never mind how to

713
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:05,000
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all they cared about was your</font>

714
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture fits in a box and when you click</font>

715
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,570
it it actually goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website that</font>

716
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,059
exists those that was the criteria of

717
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,678
approval for an ad I'm sure if I tried

718
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some like adult image in here</font>

719
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:15,620
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know actually I have no</font>

720
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea i'm going to stop that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence</font>

721
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,790
they might have allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah</font>

722
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,590
it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have just been absolutely fine</font>

723
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,760
i have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what like their criteria</font>

724
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,320
was for the picture Yeah Yeah Yeah right

725
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
all right well and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had nothing to</font>

726
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,960
do with the approval of the ad that's

727
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">once you start running the campaign</font>

728
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,320
right so I actually didn't throw any

729
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,960
money into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this point I was just</font>

730
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if it could work and then</font>

731
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,900
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to throw money into it but</font>

732
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,120
yeah I'm sure they would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive</font>

733
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,640
the paypal yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt really stupid</font>

734
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,800
sending them<font color="#CCCCCC"> money via paypal at black</font>

735
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,440
hat when I first came fish Scott yeah

736
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,639
I'm owned like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is the</font>

737
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,090
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> dangerous stupid thing I've ever</font>

738
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,890
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so but anyway so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

739
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,659
change this code you have to get it re

740
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,490
approved and there is a time delay here

741
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,350
you know they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly you know</font>

742
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,610
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you know it's not an</font>

743
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,050
automated process right someone actually

744
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,209
has to look at this and click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this ad</font>

745
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,250
which I found really funny eventually

746
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,990
when I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I was writing</font>

747
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,520
my code I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh we're getting hits</font>

748
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,410
already and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even put any money</font>

749
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,629
in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh no that's the person</font>

750
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,970
approving my ads browser right there

751
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,070
okay well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to hack an ad</font>

752
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,810
network just try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a debris of</font>

753
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,899
great I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to hack them</font>

754
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,280
though so so I was writing my code

755
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,310
directly in here but anytime I want them

756
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,560
to tweak something say my for loop or in

757
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,970
the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to it had</font>

758
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,710
to get reapproved it took a few hours

759
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,970
sometimes sometimes they were on the

760
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">East Coast I was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little west coast at</font>

761
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time it was just annoying so what I</font>

762
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:42,170
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in the bottom box I said</font>

763
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,080
forget this i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to source in</font>

764
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:50,090
script source my javascript file from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

765
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:53,360
server that's it done approved stamp of

766
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,790
approval great right so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime i</font>

767
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,979
change my code it didn't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

768
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,260
reapproved so the other thing this told

769
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,850
me was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in some magic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dreamland out</font>

770
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">there right where all of a sudden all</font>

771
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,570
the ad networks start hiring static code

772
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,340
analysis people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good at</font>

773
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,530
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript and seeing if it's</font>

774
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,810
malware or not which may happen hold on

775
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,660
you know right somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay with me</font>

776
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,450
right so if they do hire this<font color="#E5E5E5"> army of</font>

777
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript analysis people I</font>

778
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,810
can get my hat approved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

779
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,730
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> change it to you know if</font>

780
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,190
there was ever something that they said

781
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,690
hey this looks weird this is like not

782
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,490
approved if I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> this method the code</font>

783
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,230
change back and forth it doesn't matter

784
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,000
and then there's no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could keep</font>

785
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,700
up with something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

786
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,460
they did you know care about the jobs

787
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,190
with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so here's the ad that I</font>

788
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,529
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I picked I just pulled this</font>

789
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,029
right off of white hats<font color="#E5E5E5"> homepage I just</font>

790
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:48,659
you know I was lazy I was like hey

here's your banner yeah whatever but I

792
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,470
then I realized like a few hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> after i</font>

793
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,240
was already playing with this it doesn't

794
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,919
say our naming wearing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

795

797
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:05,669
lock I got 15 clicks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

first day yeah it's a free they claim it

799
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:11,070
now why wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I click on it of what I</font>

800
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,408
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what maybe they thought</font>

801
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">they whatever website they were on was I</font>

802
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:17,850
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea right it worked right but I</font>

803
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,679
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lazy and didn't find other</font>

804
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,719
pictures I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted I didn't care</font>

805
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they had looked like I didn't care</font>

806
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,019
if the ad was invisible right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

807
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,399
anyone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on it look at it click on</font>

808
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright there's one of my</font>

809
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,289
job script running so I was pretty lazy

810
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,000
but only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these got approved just</font>

811
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz that one fit in that box and they</font>

812
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,519
just thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones were ugly</font>

813
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:40,678
and disapproved them you can see

814
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,029
disapproved<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they all listen exact</font>

815
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,100
pieces of code and all of them I just

816
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">was trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get as much traffic as I</font>

817
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,360
could turns out that it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

818
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:52,289
that nine point six percent of my

819
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,779
campaign traffic but was plenty so again

820
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:59,009
this is just the code they'll be used

821
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:02,190
right you know we have our amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> ec2</font>

822
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:06,539
instance we<font color="#CCCCCC"> cranked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that number up a</font>

823
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:07,889
little bit to 10,000 we<font color="#CCCCCC"> threw I at the</font>

824
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,259
end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the URL we did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do</font>

825
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:12,240
that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see have some</font>

826
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:14,669
general idea of how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> our javascript</font>

827
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,379
is running so how far into this loop did

828
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,299
did this get I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't want to see a</font>

829
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:19,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of the same exact URL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my logs I</font>

830
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,019
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see an incrementing number</font>

831
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,379
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell is javascript is running</font>

832
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:27,029
for X number of minutes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

833
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:29,219
pretty much it so we we kind of let that

834
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:31,590
go and we fired up the browser minute

835
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,830
thing at the same time right I said hey

836
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,360
why not just just throw them together so

837
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,530
the cool thing about the browser minute

838
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,840
renting service is it

839
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,030
instant as soon as you give it a URL and

840
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,310
click go you start seeing traffic it's

841
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">not very fast though it's not like a</font>

842
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,139
bunch of browsers all at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

843
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,000
running my code it's a pretty steady

844
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,880
tick of traffic but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it definitely helped</font>

845
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,010
get the hits the hits way up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

846
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,440
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you guys remember my video</font>

847
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,879
right so watch the same numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

848
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,610
so watch the watch the same group of

849
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,530
numbers down in the bottom left right so

850
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,479
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch the the concurrent</font>

851
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:10,230
requests we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna watch the total</font>

852
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,960
hits this time also right so yeah we see

853
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:15,690
5 i'm going to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of click through and</font>

854
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,020
do some we see you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes</font>

855
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,210
we got fifteen thousand hits again just

856
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">five concurrent requests though so it's</font>

857
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,950
not that fast right there's not that

858
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,150
many browsers and i looked at my logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

859
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,910
thought something<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of funny how</font>

860
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,930
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phantom day s</font>

861
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,580
raise your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands cool so for those of</font>

862
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,040
you have in phantom JSE's eight is a

863
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,370
headless like browser you can run in

864
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript runs on node so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

865
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know which side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

866
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,850
browser renting service is gaming the

867
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,590
system but one of them is gaming the

868
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,939
system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a real browser this</font>

869
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,280
is a command line but this is some

870
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,140
automated script acting like a browser

871
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,149
so either<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are gaming the system</font>

872
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,880
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> free minutes out of this service</font>

873
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">or that service isn't actually have a</font>

874
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of browsers and they're just</font>

875
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">running this kind of stuff I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

876
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,850
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was hilarious though I</font>

877
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,889
didn't care right the traffic was

878
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,360
getting to my server that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

879
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,440
das that's all I cared about but I

880
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,710
figured I'd share<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anyway because it's</font>

881
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">a pretty funny so again back to the logs</font>

882
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:18,000
here right so five more minutes we have

883
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">28,000 hits 30 some odd requests per</font>

884
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,280
second another five minutes ago forty

885
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,379
thousand forty 3000 hits getting a

886
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,600
little faster 11 requests per second are

887
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,159
concurrent requests being processed you

888
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,929
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes later all of a</font>

889
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,520
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the browser minute</font>

890
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,520
thing was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bumpy to it just kind</font>

891
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,280
of goes all over the place yes we have

892
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,600
33<font color="#E5E5E5"> good current request that's you know</font>

893
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there that's definitely a</font>

894
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,750
few browsers running our code at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

895
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:50,530
same time 25 minutes we have 82,000 hits

896
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:56,230
to our site

897
00:34:50,530 --> 00:35:01,870
19 concurrent 35 minutes we got we have

898
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">six figures it's not bad so this is when</font>

899
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,630
the advertising network kicks in there

900
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,160
is a time delay so the browser minute

901
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,870
running service like I said was instant

902
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,600
the advertising network you give it

903
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,790
money and you say go like here's this

904
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,790
campaign and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go do its</font>

905
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,500
thing it takes about forty three minutes

906
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 26 seconds so it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> takes about 40</font>

907
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,780
minutes before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually start seeing</font>

908
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,799
real traffic coming to come in you know

909
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,300
that these ads are actually being

910
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,780
distributed at that point right once you

911
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:32,430
fund the campaign so this kicks in and

912
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:35,500
now look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the concurrent requests 255</font>

913
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,899
so that was the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magic number</font>

914
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,730
that we showed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one browser right</font>

915
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,680
when i showed my firefox connection

916
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,530
limit bypass that was the magic number

917
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">two you know just completely stall a</font>

918
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,960
default apache install I got no das

919
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,360
protection or anything like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

920
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,700
were like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 130</font>

921
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand hits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's only 36 Meg's</font>

922
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,169
this is just 404 pages over and over

923
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:02,110
again right but now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

924
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,030
concurrent things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is when that</font>

925
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:06,250
that configuration page really has

926
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,880
trouble loading that<font color="#CCCCCC"> server is pretty</font>

927
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,380
peg but really what if we did want to

928
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,790
actually attempt some sort of more

929
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,320
traditional denial of service attack

930
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,910
where we cared about instead just

931
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,030
concurrent connections we cared more

932
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:23,799
about size of traffic right so we

933
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:26,230
invoked the ass so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

934
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,260
job titles that we use of white hat and

935
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go ahead and get this badge you</font>

936
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,290
could become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certified ass like me you</font>

937
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this badge put on your blog I think</font>

938
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,880
there's an oath you have to recite

939
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,310
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then that's it</font>

940
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,900
but yeah so anyway we<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw this image</font>

941
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,610
pretty small image but we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw it</font>

942
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">up there just instead of it was just</font>

943
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">four or four pages let's throw this</font>

944
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,810
image up there and see if we could

945
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,990
generate some traffic it's all of a

946
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,730
sudden you saw is 43 minutes 36 Meg's 53

947
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,709
minutes hundred and seventeen Meg's that

948
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,950
a big difference right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

949
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:59,980
tried here this might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this might be</font>

950
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good 55 minutes 252 Meg's you</font>

951
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,460
know we're almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 3000 hits now we're</font>

952
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,569
you know so we let it run for eight

953
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:10,840
hours 114 gigs of traffic how many hits

954
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,580
is that damn i need condoms for 24

955
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,740
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> foreign CF 4 million it's</font>

956
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,080
there's still eight hours later<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

957
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,720
still 125 concurrent requests being

958
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,790
processed yeah this you know again and

959
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,310
through this whole test I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font>

960
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,560
spent ten dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay like this is</font>

961
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:29,890
really really cheap and I'm just pegging

962
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,480
my apache server<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hours right we we</font>

963
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,339
took down the image just because our

964
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,340
amazon bill was getting was getting

965
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:39,160
pretty high from hacking ourselves but

966
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,730
you can see one day later we have what

967
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,850
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 13 million hits in a day in six</font>

968
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:50,050
hours 241 gigs that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad okay for a</font>

969
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:52,299
couple bucks that's not too bad so yeah

970
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:54,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">again I think what is this a total that</font>

971
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,890
I spent currently have seventeen dollars

972
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:59,470
left in the account it's been 15 today's

973
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,560
used funds nine dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> 56 cents so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

974
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:05,319
nine dollars 56 cents and a few browser

975
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,340
minutes worth of traffic so we do

976
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,990
realize that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just our default</font>

977
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">apache installed so this wasn't terribly</font>

978
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,200
impressive for us to be tossed it we

979
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">weren't trying to be like oh look at</font>

980
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we did we did we just wanted to</font>

981
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,790
kind of figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economics of this</font>

982
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,040
and and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast we could generate this</font>

983
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:22,990
traffic so when we did it we did a

984
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,140

follow-up pretty recently I i called up

987
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,810
some friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have at Akamai and I was</font>

Harper would say great

1000
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:13,130
sure let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I mean it's not a</font>

1001
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:15,829
drop in the bucket for them what we were

1002
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,390
going to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the pretty graph</font>

1003
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:19,460
of their traffic from this was this

1004
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,200
monday so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did this research so</font>

1005
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see their flat line of like what</font>

1006
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">that usually that's their usual traffic</font>

1007
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was going on at any given time and</font>

1008
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see where exactly where we</font>

1009
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,759
turned on the the ad network or after 45

1010
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,410
minutes right when that<font color="#E5E5E5"> advent were</font>

1011
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,970
kicked in you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that spike</font>

1012
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:39,589
that first kind of bump goes up so when

1013
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,868
it goes down there for that little

1014
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:45,078
trough who wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what we did we</font>

1015
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:47,510
didn't turn it off no no we didn't kill

1016
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:49,730
we didn't toss aw c'mon code of Boston

1017
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:53,119
brand money<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the ID network we're</font>

1018
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:57,500
still running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting the site we</font>

1019
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,569
switched it to ftp we switched it to

1020
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad browser connection limit bypass</font>

1021
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">also not who I can't see it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

1022
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,490
I don't know what like we just did this

1023
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,279
monday so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't really know the</font>

1024
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,990
implications of this it didn't didn't

1025
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,670
cause any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more noise to them i don't</font>

1026
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">think i don't like since we they</font>

1027
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,690
couldn't see it we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> right the</font>

1028
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,828
reason I liked the reason I liked doing

1029
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,480
this was that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had some</font>

1030
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,980
visualization now of the traffic right

1031
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,079
not just our logs and how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> hits we</font>

1032
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,750
have we have how many requests per

1033
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,069
second how many requests per minute so

1034
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,220
we're like oh we don't like seeing this

1035
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:31,819
so you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn the HTTP</font>

1036
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:33,379
back on and and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we relied to run</font>

1037
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:35,660
for about two and a half hours total in

1038
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,690
time and we averaged I think three

1039
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,180
hundred thousand requests for a minute

1040
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,589
we generated i think was three points

1041
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,000
something digs per second which wasn't

1042
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:46,849
much but again it was just four<font color="#CCCCCC"> of four</font>

1043
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,710
pages three hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

1044
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:49,880
requests per minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked him ok this</font>

1045
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,960
obviously didn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you because</font>

1046
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,549
you're thirty percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1047
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,309
what would matter to you and his answer

1048
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:57,740
was we would cause them some grief at

1049
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:59,630
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million requests per minute</font>

1050
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,209
Akamai we could cause Akamai grief at

1051
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,529
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten million requests per minute</font>

1052
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,359
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really orders of magnitude</font>

1053
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:07,519
off right that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a few you know</font>

1054
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,808
multiples but if I ran some multiple

1055
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:13,819
campaigns here and really put all again

1056
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:17,289
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forgot about this this whole</font>

1057
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:17,288
thing thirty-three dollars

1058
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,480
3333 but I went crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put 30 Lexington</font>

1059
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,828
I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 bucks in this thing I still</font>

1060
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,829
have a few bucks but he wants me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to da</font>

1061
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:28,000
cui got a few bucks left<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so three</font>

1062
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:29,769
hundred thousand requests per minute for

1063
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,769
two and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half hours cost me 33 dollars</font>

1064
00:41:29,769 --> 00:41:36,490
and 41 cents not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so this</font>

1065
00:41:32,769 --> 00:41:38,649
stuff again I'm at a time but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1066
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,299
save save some time for questions but

1067
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">this actually does happen in the wild</font>

1068
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:44,319
not the the ad network<font color="#CCCCCC"> pot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

1069
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,230
happen in the wild but this was actually

1070
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,299
who's heard of this openx off work but a

1071
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,529
few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah I hadn't heard of it</font>

1072
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:52,960
until I saw the story it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

1073
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:56,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cpanel for admin it's like what ad</font>

1074
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,390
networks used as software there was no

1075
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,980
day in that and people hacked the actual

1076
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,960
ad network to distribute their ad

1077
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,180
network malware so it's obviously on

1078
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,250
people's radar but but as far as

1079
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript botnet I we haven't seen</font>

1080
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,420
anything yet but you know usually we

1081
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:12,160
like to wrap up these presentations with

1082
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,559
some warm and fuzzy solution of how we

1083
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,848
can protect ourselves but like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

1084
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,109
throughout the whole beginning part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1085
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:18,970
this presentation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just how the</font>

1086
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:21,759
web works and just loading image tags

1087
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,950
into a browser unless people are going

1088
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:25,660
to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off image tags I don't I don't</font>

1089
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,359
really I can't really think of a way to

1090
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop this this is a quote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from Kaminsky</font>

1091
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,019
bit that Jeremiah likes to use nobody's

1092
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,549
breaking the web do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not now not ever</font>

1093
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's really we're going to have to</font>

1094
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:37,119
do is try to break it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to fix it</font>

1095
00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:38,440
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have a warm fuzzy</font>

1096
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,900
ending sorry I just thought this was

1097
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,420
kind of cool so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have five</font>

1098
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:52,660
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions two mins my clocks</font>

1099
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:56,140
often I have 39 any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> no wow I</font>

1100
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:58,950
usually slicing this cuz I alright cool

1101
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,950
