11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost over another hour we hope to</font>

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,720
so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so we're going to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

14
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,280
hopefully interesting for you here but

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,630
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of calm Michael down</font>

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,189
here a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit yeah kind of gets a</font>

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,960
little bit out of control<font color="#E5E5E5"> some calm down</font>

18
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,960
a little bit I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce us so</font>

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,570
Michael golf myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian Robertson we</font>

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,770
both go out and find bad juju and stuff

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,298
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically kind of call ourselves</font>

22
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:23,929
of course as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> the milf hunters</font>

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:26,479
so you know what were you seriously what

24
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:28,280
were you thinking get the mind out of

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,408
the gutter all right all right now we're

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,270
in life form and so we go after the

27
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,179
trigger finger their thing all right we

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,759
go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad actors of course that's</font>

29
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:43,429
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after and so some of</font>

30
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,770
our background here which we think

31
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:48,770
brings a unique perspective to what

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,929
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're both we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> both do</font>

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:54,819
forensics analysis we go pretty deep on

34
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:57,439
stuff no pun intended malware hunters

35
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">wear blue team errs defenders of the</font>

36
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,758
good it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to find</font>

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,280
vulnerabilities and stuff it's much more

38
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,249
difficult to find ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent and</font>

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,530
defend your networks and that's where we

40
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:11,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to share this kind of information</font>

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,360
we're both developers and we're also

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,980
consultants so we're wrapping this all

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,720
up and hopefully we can impart some

44
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,950
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll help you all and be</font>

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,250
able to take back some actionable

46
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,250
information

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:30,099
and of course we have unique huh and aha

48
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">moments so let's start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

49
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:36,250
typical malware investigation from an IT

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,260
perspective we've we've done several

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,170
talks we've surveyed audiences and this

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,420
is typically what we find if a piece of

53
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,518
malware is found on the system usually

54
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,010
the IT person will be alerted to it by

55
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,900
their antivirus program sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

56
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,629
drive-by<font color="#CCCCCC"> downloads sometimes it to USB</font>

57
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,810
stick something like that and typically

58
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:58,599
they'll just perform another<font color="#E5E5E5"> antivirus</font>

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,630
scan and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up clean awesome</font>

60
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,679
we're good if it has another problem

61
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,390
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will initiate a scan</font>

62
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,040
questioning and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the</font>

63
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,149
room actually see this in practice and

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">IT again lot more hands come on they're</font>

67
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,980
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know depending upon the</font>

68
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,500
tools that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have at hand I love this</font>

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,798
example here just from the perspective

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,380
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful guidance that kaspersky</font>

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,760
gives you hear of what's their

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:35,350
recommendation ignore do nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hey</font>

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you know what's that problem solved</font>

74
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,910
absolutely I've taken action and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

75
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,100
know what maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to apply this</font>

76
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,750
great logic across everything else so

77
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:48,430
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me check</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the apply to all objects</font>

78
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:51,670
button to just simplify my life great so

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,049
antivirus sucks we know that okay it

80
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,638
hasn't been able to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

81
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:57,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the samples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming out you</font>

82
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,019
know a lot of repeat stuff but just

83
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,220
small has changes is all it requires to

84
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">bypass it in a lot of cases and you know</font>

85
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,940
with the things that Michael and I have

86
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzed we've got a detection rate of</font>

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,970
about three percent of things that are

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,560
actually malware we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzed we're</font>

89
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting hit rate of three percent when</font>

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
we throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up against things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

91
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">virus total so pretty low and that's</font>

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">really common the reason for that I</font>

93
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think even being a size three percent is</font>

94
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,450
because they fish us as well and they

95
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,030
know what AV you're using so they're

96
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to give you a piece of fish or</font>

97
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,590
something

98
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:37,539
not really stealthy in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email fish and</font>

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,700
your AV will not catch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when we</font>

100
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,930
upload it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> VT we get some hits it's</font>

101
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,120
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only reason it's a three</font>

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,470
percent yep the other interesting thing

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,810
too is when you're looking at what does

104
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,480
get detected in antivirus with when

105
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're looking at say buyers total right</font>

106
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,190
it's pretty common where you'll either

107
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:00,160
get maybe one or two hits on something

108
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,440
or you'll get like almost everything

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,730
hitting on something because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they share</font>

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,460
the information they have in the back

111
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,170
end so think about that the next time

112
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,210
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at changing up your</font>

113
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:14,440
AV product or considering whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

114
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:16,330
it's all that useful to you so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> t has</font>

115
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,100
it has a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> options when they're</font>

116
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,710
dealing this with us right you can

117
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,230
either ignore the basic problem maintain

118
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,729
your status quo<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I know we've got a</font>

119
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,250
problem I know we can't find this stuff

120
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,810
easily but we don't know what else to do

121
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,220
so we're just going to keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

122
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font>

123
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with it I'm just you know that's</font>

124
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,730
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all we're doing or you can</font>

125
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a better job watching for odd</font>

126
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,950
activity and go into deeper

127
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,420
investigations looking at things like

128
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know doing a much better job looking</font>

129
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,090
at things with splunk or using big fix

130
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,040
and unique ways or doing anything else

131
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,479
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an additional analysis and</font>

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,570
drilling in and doing deeper

133
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,160
investigations or you can wait until

134
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're told that you have a breach and</font>

135
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,200
then you can spend a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on it</font>

136
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,110
and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those breaches you'll get</font>

137
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,120
notified of come from external third

138
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,590
parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the stats here ninety-four</font>

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
percent of her since been reported

140
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,429
lately that's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that basically</font>

141
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,140
means we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admit ourselves</font>

142
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:19,690
or we don't know yes David<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh why are</font>

143
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,729
one and three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah it's a</font>

144
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,350
matter of time that's right yeah it's a

145
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,540
matter of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a fallacy right</font>

146
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,250
210 day average right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

147
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brighton because this is what a lot of</font>

148
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,880
this is what a lot of folks think right

149
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,789
a lot of a lot of IT shops think that

150
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,550
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be there it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but the</font>

151
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,930
reality is you will get breached you

152
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,790
will have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen and you will</font>

153
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend once somebody once the</font>

154
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,600
right person finds out you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,289
spend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money on it it really</font>

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends on who that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party is</font>

157
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:49,068
how they bring that information to you

158
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,799
if it goes to the press is generally the

159
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know organs goes to the press or it</font>

160
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to some other source where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

161
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:58,009
to now legally take action and follow

162
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,539
state breach notification law that's

163
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,399
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money goes in right that's when</font>

164
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,639
it starts flowing paste bin I got a

165
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:06,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">reported payment so typical of forensics</font>

166
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,939
investigation examine registry keys

167
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,589
right so we're basically looking at

168
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,719
windows system it's ninety percent whats

169
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:13,639
in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our environments and we also</font>

170
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,808
look for nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop files obviously</font>

171
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,819
this is kind of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what you</font>

172
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,409
do in a daily basis or the tools will do

173
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,779
in a daily basis you know tripwire for

174
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,699
example we look for new services running

175
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,949
in processes we can do that via<font color="#CCCCCC"> look eat</font>

176
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the logs and doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Splunk you can do</font>

177
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,149
it manually whatever tools you use so

178
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:31,189
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might use it in sporadic Tornetta</font>

179
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:35,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what your sat in front you're</font>

180
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,740
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get picked on come on right and</font>

181
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:38,599
then you once you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all that stuff</font>

182
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,979
the process is running you're going to

183
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,339
then start looking at what's suspicious

184
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,959
to you the short list of stuff and then

185
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,639
we're going to generally exclude<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign</font>

186
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,529
files and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that</font>

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,209
in a second and of course there's other

188
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,949
friends at goodness but this is kind of

189
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the not deep forensics this is the first</font>

190
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:58,789
pass the triage kind of forensics we

191
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,459
call it sniper forensics so with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

192
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,680
your tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricks that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you use at</font>

193
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:05,959
some point you're looking at a system

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,120
that you think is probably infected and

195
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,159
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at a file and you're</font>

196
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:14,180
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself the question is this</font>

197
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:17,089
file ballot is this a good file is it a

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:22,430
bad file and so we put up a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples</font>

199
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:26,180
here for you so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an nvidia user</font>

200
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,830
experience driver it's got a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

201
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,089
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and you can look at</font>

202
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,550
this and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell that you can tell</font>

203
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,198
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is supposed to be you don't</font>

204
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if it's good or if it's bad we've</font>

205
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:38,899
got some<font color="#CCCCCC"> information on you know what it</font>

206
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:41,419
is this one here you don't have a file

207
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,818
description it says the type of file

208
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:48,649
application extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for file</font>

209
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:50,930
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 20 probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not true product</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blah language is invariant language</font>

213
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,819
unusual and now you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file name</font>

214
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,410
down here

215
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:05,389
original file name that's embedded into

216
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,978
the PE so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't really know what</font>

217
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is I'm have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more digging</font>

218
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,789
and find out what that is and then

219
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:13,249
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got something like this file</font>

220
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:16,269
description to do all right how many

221
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:18,850
developers know what that is there

222
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:22,549
placeholder right all right file version

223
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,100
101 product<font color="#CCCCCC"> name to do product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name all</font>

227
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's probably developed in France and</font>

228
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,989
then we've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original file name so</font>

229
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:38,539
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this one going what</font>

230
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:40,879
the hell is this this looks funky this

231
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:42,979
looks really weird right let me check

232
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,229
that out how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have gone down</font>

233
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:46,759
this route how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we all</font>

234
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:48,589
have to do this if we're we're ops

235
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,899
people looking at the stuff we have to

236
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">determine whether this is good or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

237
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so how about this one I</font>

238
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,259
apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it being a little dark</font>

239
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,389
here but here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another example this</font>

240
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:02,660
file here not a lot of information on it

241
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:07,309
if you run this file it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

242
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:10,639
program name is signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> exe title very</font>

243
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:13,339
descriptive verify publishers it's got a

244
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:18,199
certificate on it of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dell that's</font>

245
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:22,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a part of a Adele what is it</font>

246
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:24,169
Dells local backup utility so this one

247
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:27,469
this utility actually does some

248
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:28,909
privilege escalations on box in terms of

249
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,559
analyzing this from a mallard

250
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:34,549
perspective this thing's what looks

251
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,829
really weird so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did a</font>

252
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:39,978
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad job of naming this thing</font>

253
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:42,858
clearly nobody freaking ran this in a QA

254
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:45,499
mode to see how this thing looks to the

255
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:48,079
consumer or folks like us that are

256
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:50,720
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze a machine anybody here</font>

257
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,159
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell take this back please tell</font>

258
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,899
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to pick on</font>

259
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,600
another rid of yours

260
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:58,509
yeah yep tell you how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here</font>

261
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,529
would click on this and trust everybody

262
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:01,839
in the room is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click on this</font>

263
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,160
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we pretty much all do hide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

264
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,790
actually clicked in it multiple times

265
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:11,949
just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> export so how do</font>

266
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,929
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if it's good so what's some</font>

267
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:15,998
kind of common things beyond just the

268
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:19,119
run another antivirus scan that that we

269
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:20,980
do and yeah this isn't very<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep</font>

270
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:23,649
forensics right but this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

271
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,809
starting off<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you run it</font>

272
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,850
against virustotal you run it against

273
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:31,689
you do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> searches on it you</font>

274
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,360
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> file advisors sandboxes you</font>

275
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:36,819
compared to other files on your other

276
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,160
systems and if needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can download</font>

277
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:41,170
and compare it download the same utility

278
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,269
if you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and compare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

279
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:46,689
version and see if it's the same so

280
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:49,149
let's step through those<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay buyers</font>

281
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:52,110
totals this is really interesting one

282
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,459
because I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a bin but today</font>

283
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,509
specifically today a friend asked for us

284
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:59,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help him describe this problem a</font>

285
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,019
couple slides from now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font>

286
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,949
and I went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth his first</font>

287
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:08,679
response to this was oh just triggered a

288
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,849
couple odd keylogger scenarios that

289
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,379
triggered with mcafee it's a false

290
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,920
positive because this file is actually

291
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:17,290
signed it's in it's in bit 9s database

292
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,089
it's actually signed okay it looks good

293
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,459
there's other you guys have clicked on

294
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,939
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things go to the data but this is</font>

295
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,069
a well-known winnt<font color="#E5E5E5"> I well known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to us</font>

296
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:30,459
not willing to all you but a well-known

297
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:32,769
piece of winnin<font color="#CCCCCC"> TIA it is a launcher</font>

298
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,689
okay and so I had to actually go back

299
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,089
and described to him how this thing

300
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:38,889
worked because<font color="#E5E5E5"> his first thought just</font>

301
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,049
like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us normally do just like we</font>

302
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">used to do look at this and say well</font>

303
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:45,129
this one's now bad because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but</font>

304
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this information hey it's VT</font>

305
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:49,089
says it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and--but nines in the</font>

306
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,759
repository we're going to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but</font>

307
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:54,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reality is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad juju really</font>

308
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,720
bad juju<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's piece of it and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

309
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:57,368
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means here in a</font>

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,259
second but most of the time you analyze

311
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:02,069
it looks like this yeah and of course

312
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,069
sooner here's load

313
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,310
TI payload but the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

314
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,870
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real windows file</font>

315
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,430
that's been modified we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

316
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too yeah the key takeaway</font>

317
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">from this one is when you're doing an</font>

318
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:18,529
analysis when it says detection ratio<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0</font>

319
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the only thing you should be using</font>

320
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,370
virustotal for is to confirm that

321
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,440
something is malware if you get a bunch

322
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's malware if you get like 20</font>

323
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,940
40 hits anything basically beyond

324
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:32,149
generally around three to five hits you

325
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,389
say about five hits are good but if you

326
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,130
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero hits don't trust it it can</font>

327
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:39,740
still be malware a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

328
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,910
why we're saying 90 right ninety-seven

329
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,070
percent of the stuff that we've looked

330
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,380
at that we know is malware doesn't get

331
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,339
hit in here zero hits now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool thing</font>

332
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,769
about this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the fact</font>

333
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,290
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real windows five okay</font>

334
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,600
now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people say if i upload my</font>

335
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,510
malware and virus total comes back and

336
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,790
says never seen it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've just told</font>

337
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,800
the malware writers that you have the

338
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,540
malware because now they can check

339
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">virustotal for the hash and see that</font>

340
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,040
someone checked it we've been discovered

341
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,990
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so is this a decision you have to</font>

342
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,069
make when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're researching this stuff</font>

343
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,829
to determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not you're going</font>

344
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to upload the virus total when we do</font>

345
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:20,329
this we've already determined that this

346
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,890
stuff is bad we're putting it up here so

347
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:23,449
we can laugh and say yep they didn't

348
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,399
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about this right so we're</font>

349
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:26,899
validating what we already know and yeah

350
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,060
we're letting<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's a cat and</font>

351
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">mouse game with apt we're letting him</font>

352
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,760
know they know we know where they know

353
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,980
we know

354
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,920
and all that it was back forth back

355
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,460
forth but the reality is we triggered it

356
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,280
we let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we know you know you</font>

357
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,720
know Google so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I find out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

358
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,920
file as part of this payload and I

359
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,930
google it three hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what in Google</font>

360
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,020
can you google and only get three hits

361
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,640
one hit two hits four hits nothing right

362
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,000
if you don't if you can't get something

363
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Google out of it that's bad and so</font>

364
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,910
here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you look at all</font>

365
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,360
these they actually have nothing to do

366
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we put in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google search</font>

367
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,910
another indicator that something's amiss

368
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,290
here and then Ian did a good ones you

369
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">just wanted to trigger one because we</font>

370
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,670
see this a lot when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do these yeah</font>

371
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,860
it's very common that if you put in if

372
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're searching for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a file one of the</font>

373
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">first hits that will come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a his</font>

374
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,220
sites that say oh yeah we can help you

375
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,290
identify and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problem and help</font>

376
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,030
you replace any bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's that you have</font>

377
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,390
on your system just install this utility

378
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:36,470
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and so I just put in some</font>

379
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,449
BS dll name i called it your dll and

380
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,690
local comes up dll-files how to install

381
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:45,140
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dll MPP tools free download I mean</font>

382
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,310
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on google for going</font>

383
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,319
and trying to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you whether or not</font>

384
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff's good or bad it's all</font>

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,090
information you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take into</font>

386
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,670
account so file<font color="#CCCCCC"> advisor here's the same</font>

387
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,770
file if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you noticed earlier it was</font>

388
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,120
formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot exe but if you notice here</font>

389
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's ink formed X exe this is probably</font>

390
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,330
I'd love to get a copy the real one but

391
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,219
this is probably it's real name so the

392
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Marian's have actually changed the name</font>

393
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,770
in the use of it it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a valid</font>

394
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,300
executable probably or has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

395
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,160
certificate that I was signed with and

396
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,380
stolen we all know that happen with

397
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,209
Stuxnet so it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those cases or</font>

398
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">micronauts off not know that it's bad</font>

399
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,470
yet and have it has not revoked<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

400
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,540
certificate the funny thing here is if

401
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,250
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here and we're not picking</font>

402
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,079
on the vendor like this is really good

403
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,190
in certain environments right so but

404
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,350
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font>

405

make bold statements we gotta think we

409
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,290
got to think outside the box we got to

410
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,780
change our behavior three<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed been</font>

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,720
see it right so PC phone this is

423
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,069
actually a part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> activesync</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font>

424
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,260
version can't tell you that don't know

425
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,639
haven't looked that far I just know that

426
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,400
this is the launcher for some really bad

427
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,380
juju but the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this trust is</font>

428
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,910
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on these tools that</font>

429
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,460
these vendors sell these tools with this

430
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,720
trust you know is a bad scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

431
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,510
have to take all the pieces of

432
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,850
information and say hey wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute</font>

433
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:40,670
what I just saw earlier is counter to

434
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,800
this what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here now we have</font>

435
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,970
the other files now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing with</font>

436
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one we don't have the screenshot on</font>

437
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,270
this one but behind the scenes here

438
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,390
there's another screen that shows you

439
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:53,930
the trust rating level so it's out of 10

440
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,690
and in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> book for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with bit9 this</font>

441
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,940
particular product you can move a little

442
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,700
slider bar to say how much trust you're

443
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,050
willing to to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the software</font>

444
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so you base it takes that into</font>

445
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,520
account so you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anything that's</font>

446
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,170
like 7 or higher you know for example I

447
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,020
little go ahead and automatically trust

448
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,720
those things this one here anybody have

449
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,770
a guess on what that rating was how many

450
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 or higher all</font>

451
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,600
right Christian doesn't count<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz he</font>

452
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">already knows all right how about 8 or</font>

453
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,139
higher all right two hands three hands

454
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,970
no put your hand down Victoria no Victor

455
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,110
I was like no other city it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 it</font>

456
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,820
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 ok you couldn't even if you're</font>

457
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,129
using this particular solution

458
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,389
configured this particular way now the

459
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,100
debate is this matt is this malware

460
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:49,280
maybe originally it was you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,560
2009 May twenty-third 2009<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's 2013 it</font>

462
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,500
has a thrust of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 out of 10 it's been</font>

463
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,320
seen three times twice in China

464
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,820
how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here trust the spot and</font>

465
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,110
I'm telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is part of activesync</font>

466
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,550
might be here trust this file should

467
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,290
have been revoked should be removed

468
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:05,470
that's my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's his opinion</font>

469
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,430
couple of people depending on sure we

470
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,930
told<font color="#CCCCCC"> them this a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year and a half ago</font>

471
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:11,590
it's still in the repository this is

472
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,390
pulled up<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this week they don't like</font>

473
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,889
is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this but it again it's</font>

474
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,250
it's we're have to educate you that's

475
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,170
what we're here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sand boxes so we</font>

476
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,420
also utilize sandboxes problem with sand

477
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,490
boxes is if I have a static dll if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

478
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,080
have that executable that<font color="#E5E5E5"> X cube will do</font>

479
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,090
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I bet static dll and I</font>

480
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,620
throw in sandbox it doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

481
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,379
that comes back with this nice little

482
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,239
screen cannot load equals yes you need

483
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have an installer something to</font>

484
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,040
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dll into memory for sandbox</font>

485
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,659
to work we've also received malware the

486
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,460
minute I put on the vm to analyze it

487
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,700
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes later it's gone so they're</font>

488
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,530
doing vm detection right so you have to

489
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,150
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and safe hmm how am I</font>

490
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,830
going to see how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sandbox is</font>

491
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,570
payload I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the delivery</font>

492
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,689
mechanism to already Anna box I've

493
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:59,439
looked at it I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the X cube all</font>

494
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:01,030
so again here's the load birth showing

495
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,680
that it's you know again no valid two

496
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,930
different sandboxes no valid win32

497
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,820
binary because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vol but yet</font>

498
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,180
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually loading a fished</font>

499
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,700
scenario and there is a report that we

500
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,430
see that's the weapon that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wop</font>

501
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ending on so so if you were to you were</font>

502
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,280
to be looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen here you'd</font>

503
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,950
probably look at this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say well this</font>

504
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,300
doesn't look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware right it looks</font>

505
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:28,120
ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for the to get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit deeper</font>

506
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the dll aspect of why these</font>

507
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,169
sandboxes can't find these things

508
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,639
there's there's two ways well there's

509
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,040
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> two ways but there's two basic</font>

510
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,650
ways that you can basically execute code

511
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,870
from within a dll and one is you've got

512
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,370
an entry point where as soon as the dll

513
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,959
is loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it'll go ahead and execute</font>

514
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,179
that code within that section the other

515
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,120
is you're basically tapping into one of

516
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,180
the methods that's within the dll one of

517
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,419
the imports and when you're doing it in

518
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,850
that method it doesn't know the sandbox

519
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,710
doesn't know how to call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DLL it</font>

520
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,439
doesn't know which method to use or

521
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:05,350
which parameters to use you've got

522
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,119
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good stuff where you can have a</font>

523
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,908
method that

524
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,158
normally takes let's say windows dll and

525
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:12,869
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> method that normally takes a</font>

526
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,019
parameter that is a always a positive

527
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:17,759
value and you've baked this malware so

528
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:19,139
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass it you're</font>

529
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,269
going to passing in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative value</font>

530
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:22,948
when it sees that negative value it's

531
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:25,169
going to take a different action well

532
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:27,659
how's the sandbox going to have any idea

533
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:29,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that logic that it needs to pass it</font>

534
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:33,149
this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to get to execute</font>

535
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:35,189
that way it's too easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get past these</font>

536
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:37,589
sand boxes and by the way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

537
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:39,959
another valid PE injected modifying

538
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:42,839
windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealer so two of them in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

539
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:44,369
and that's the wonderful results that

540
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,629
you get some of the sandbox with some

541
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,309
sand boxes are better than others

542
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:49,769
clearly this one wasn't very good in its

543
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:52,168
results doesn't tell you a whole lot and

544
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,939
you can go to the different screens and

545
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:58,319
information but this is you know kind of

546
00:21:53,939 --> 00:22:00,149
what we have is the tools we use so how

547
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,459
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know any enough that's good</font>

548
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:03,809
comparing to other systems how do you

549
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:06,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the other systems are good if</font>

550
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:08,849
you're comparing it you know is your

551
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:12,539
infection<font color="#CCCCCC"> just on one machine is it on</font>

552
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:14,609
two machines is on three machines we've

553
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,629
seen compromises across hundreds of

554
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:20,519
machines quite often I our vendors so we

555
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:22,259
had a conversation with wanted a con<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

556
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,359
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yes I was brought in to</font>

557
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,669
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at one box we know that service</font>

558
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,918
compromise want to look at and they

559
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,479
found it and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay have you checked</font>

560
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,829
all these others now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure</font>

561
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:33,239
doesn't have it but you mind if we check

562
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:36,329
it and won't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> very long to load our</font>

563
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:41,279
agent level up okay over 100 infections

564
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:43,019
st. Maur right yeah so if you didn't

565
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,669
build a protected repository in advance

566
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,199
if you don't have a good set of very

567
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,999
simple from a very simple perspective

568
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:51,779
good set of hashes to compare and some

569
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:53,939
good things then once you're in this

570
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:55,139
mode of incident response you can't just

571
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:59,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly go okay let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make something</font>

572
00:22:55,139 --> 00:23:00,928
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not time and so if you</font>

573
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're probably</font>

574
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:06,209
replacing some reliance on certificates

575
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:08,158
that is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably weed</font>

576
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:09,629
out those files that are digitally

577
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,429
signed that have authentic code

578
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:14,629
certificates on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> since you can focus</font>

579
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,629
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that don't</font>

580

581
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:24,710
love to heat them now that I don't work

582
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">for them pick on dell earlier now i'm</font>

583
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna pick on HP want to hijack this</font>

584
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">light so these are typical HP files if</font>

585
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,219
you've ever had to go through whenever I

586
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,980
do a come up with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list to focus</font>

587
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,960
in on these damn things are always in

588
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,330
there he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that you can yeah they're</font>

589
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,669
always that in their goddamn et<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

590
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,460
fixit's I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

591
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,620
there like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

592
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the pieces of information as Ian just</font>

593
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,428
described certificate wise verified

594
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,860
unsigned now I'm sorry but these are HP

management<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's what in the hell they</font>

596
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,570
doing not signing their management<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's</font>

597
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,129
that's one the other is the name of the

598
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,129
file hpc something something something

599
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,590
the internal names are pml driver double

600
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,240
yellow why is the filename different

601
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,000
than the internal name warning<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

602
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arvidsson again to us it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

603
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,049
things we look at so it's like ah

604
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:20,630
there's not one there's not two there's

605
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:23,690
not three there's four a lot of these

606
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,399
and the bottom one clearly SNMP why in

607
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,919
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would you do that for SNMP</font>

608
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:30,018
drivers I mean just it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stupid</font>

609
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,389
right this is the behavior we have all

610
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you take back to your shops and say</font>

611
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,809
you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quit doing this start</font>

612
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,639
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a five minute</font>

613
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,260
job that you can determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> if your guys</font>

614
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,629
are writing stuff that they can fix this

615
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,408
so we can ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easier to move on</font>

616
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,710
and all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can ignore it and move on</font>

617
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:49,940
and of course you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the the idea that</font>

618
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,320
weeding out the ones that have

619
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,590
certificates because they're probably

620
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,450
good is pretty bad we found just in you

621
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,330
know the stuff that we've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

622
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,470
Intel Microsoft lenovo all these

623
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,610
different certificates there's tons of

624
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,470
different certificates this is just a

625
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,870
short list but you know big name

626
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,299
companies things files that they are

627
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,510
stealing their certificates and then

628
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:16,090
they are making injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's or they</font>

629
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,830
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> making their own crafting their own</font>

630
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,740
executables and appearing as those

631
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,080
products so if you see something like

632
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,970
that very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine just</font>

633
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,908
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> away by looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the certificate</font>

634
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,049
whether or not it's good

635
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:37,159
and another problem is Microsoft's

636
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:41,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">caching of certificates the the crls is</font>

637
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:44,489
awful it's really freaking back

638
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:47,970
Microsoft can<font color="#CCCCCC"> cache certificates for</font>

639
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:49,710
months months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have had on more</font>

640
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,609
than one occasion where we've had

641
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,419
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have caught it had a</font>

642
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:56,519
looked like it had a valid certificate

643
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,359
on it checked it against the built-in

644
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:02,429
Microsoft API calls and we go and we

645
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,989
pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CR l's manually and we look at</font>

646
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:09,299
it and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been revoked and been</font>

647
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:11,369
revoked for months it's there is no way

648
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:17,039
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually built in windows</font>

649
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:22,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing the windows API will refuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

650
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,419
a crl check on demand if it does if it

651
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,580
has never<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked their certificate it</font>

652
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:28,409
will go do one but if it has checked a

653
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,908
certificate and its stores if you look

654
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:32,039
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certificate details if you drill</font>

655
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:33,979
down far enough on a certificate it'll

656
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,239
tell you how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cached for</font>

657
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:39,210
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way within the operating</font>

658
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:42,450
system this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> documented for you to</font>

659
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:45,029
force it to do a crl check so once it's

660
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:49,279
cached if that changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time soon</font>

661
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:51,929
screwed so if you're doing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your code</font>

662
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,739
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of certificate checking please</font>

663
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:57,179
do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the built-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> api and</font>

664
00:26:54,739 --> 00:27:01,979
keep that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mind when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing your</font>

665
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:03,450
certificate checks yeah no no I

666
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:05,399
literally there's there's actually

667
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,619
there's an msdn document I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you</font>

668
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:10,830
to that spells it out in no uncertain

669
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:12,809
terms that this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in operating</font>

670
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,869
system function and it cannot be over it

671
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:18,200
there's no way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've drop there's no</font>

672
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:22,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">way you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to write your own</font>

673
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,940
crl and<font color="#CCCCCC"> OCS CP parser or you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can wait</font>

674
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:25,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones and months and months yeah</font>

675
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:31,039
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it will it's got some</font>

676
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,718
internal it's got some different steps

677
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it goes through to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

678
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:36,559
determination one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

679
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:38,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it'll go and it'll check when it</font>

680
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,219
checks the website the website can

681
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:44,089
present it with here's how long you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

682
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:45,609
cash it for ya so it depends Mel tends

683
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:49,208
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but it doesn't have to be</font>

684
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:51,708
yeah based on info these are Chinese

685
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:55,369
these are Americans would you trust

686
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:58,959
these for those or none<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what you</font>

687
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:01,129
now know see the challenge here

688
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:04,009
certificates so more on certificates so

689
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:05,418
again we'll talk more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the details</font>

690
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:09,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sick check you haven't used it before</font>

691
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:11,659
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of the Tencent malware</font>

692
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,839
we got the certificate of his leash use

693
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,759
reuse stolen sign again it shows that

694
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:18,168
it's sign shows that since inside its

695
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,569
got all the data cut it off so you don't

696
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:22,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">go you know run down and then again</font>

697
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,719
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the product ID QQ question</font>

698
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:26,299
question question probably have some

699
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:28,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">Unicode in there you know first thought</font>

700
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,849
is yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably okay we know</font>

701
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:34,009
that's bad but to you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably okay</font>

702
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:36,319
so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge here that we</font>

703
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:37,669
have with the stuff that they steal the

704
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:39,529
certificate did they reuse the

705
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:41,749
certificate did they do a PE

706
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,999
modification that that kept the

707
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:45,349
certificate intact these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

708
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,759
questions that you know we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

709
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,938
evaluate when we're doing yeah you can

710
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:52,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a certificate out of one file just</font>

711
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:54,409
the digital certificates just sitting

712
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:57,339
within the PE file you can take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

713
00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:01,099
you can move it into another PE file

714
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:02,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay which is fine now unless your</font>

715
00:29:01,099 --> 00:29:07,428
function that's doing the certificate

716
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:09,469
check checks the sort of the the hash as

717
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,929
a signature that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets built based upon</font>

718
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:13,609
portions of that PE file and there's a

719
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,529
digital signature that's made based<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon</font>

720
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:16,968
that that signature<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that</font>

721
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:21,739
validates unless your code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking</font>

722
00:29:16,969 --> 00:29:23,539
that then you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that yes this</font>

723
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,919
you basically what windows does is it'll

724
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,939
check the certificate you'll pull this

725
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,709
certificate out and verify the

726
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:30,229
certificate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't verify that the</font>

727
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:33,589
certificate is signed for that

728
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:35,210
particular file so watch out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

729
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,649
awesomeness yeah by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

730
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,830
the last one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> died txt that you</font>

731
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:42,229
saw up there a fish this is also a fish

732
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,449
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> is he a pattern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here the fishes</font>

733
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,210
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid certificate to get</font>

734
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">by-products</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe to try and make you</font>

735
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,100
think it's okay so here's another one

736
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,200
again formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> exe so now you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what</font>

737
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,939
it actually it is now fortunately since

738
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,440
we've had this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while now we get this</font>

739
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,659
required certificate is not within its

740
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,419
validity period when verifying against

741
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:04,820
the revocation list but a lot but same

742
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,559
thing microsoft corporation inc formed

743
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,899
exe but yet it's been delivered<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

744
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,549
formed exe right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can tell you</font>

745
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:12,260
what a fishing should be changing names

746
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:14,929
ninety<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent which it looks like look</font>

747
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,419
at the names don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change but here you</font>

748
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">go it's signed it just can't be updated</font>

749
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:23,990
because we know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can explain it</font>

750
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">so again certificates the good in the</font>

751
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:31,309
bay so on the Left we have a real

752
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:34,100
windows system32 load load<font color="#CCCCCC"> verb dll</font>

753
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,260
here's the ballot signed again can't

754
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,730
validate it it's been there awhile but

755
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,440
here's all the signs stuff and here's

756
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> name of the file its load</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control or</font>

757
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,029
dll from the movie and then here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

758
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,549
same file that in the course of

759
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:48,710
infecting the machine they copy off they

760
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:54,168
PE infect and look what happen to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

761
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:55,549
the hashes change the f1 FC won the name

762
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,559
and everything else all the metadata is

763
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:00,679
the same but you now have an unsigned

764
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,710
file but for the most part these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

765
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:08,690
exactly the same clouds so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good the</font>

766
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:11,140
bad and the ugly if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at side the</font>

767
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:14,799
actual PE header here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the four</font>

768
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:17,270
sections but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> p infected now have six</font>

769
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,690
this is the modified version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

770
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">file VOD so what they're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

771
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,929
example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just once you're</font>

772
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,168
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on box they're not actually</font>

773
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:29,000
dropping a particular updated dll

774
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,890
they're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on box or sing what dll</font>

775
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,750
you have they know which one they want

776
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,340
to target and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just injecting</font>

777
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,620
code they're taking that making a copy

778
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,658
injecting code into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dll they're</font>

779
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,620
rewriting the PE section headers they're

780
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:41,330
pointing in two different locations

781
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,219
they'll put some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the</font>

782
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,610
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call that as either part</font>

783
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,460
of the entry point or whatever whatever

784
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:50,070
want to do in their code so everything

785
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,309
about the file otherwise looks very much

786
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:57,360
the same now if they stole a certificate

787
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:59,340
and then they resign this file boom bit

788
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">product like bit nine maybe even you and</font>

789
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,709
reviewing it would see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> valid did it</font>

790
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in move on totally bad so download</font>

791
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,160
and compare you can download appear

792
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,630
files right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go up and then that i</font>

793
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">can grab this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this with a</font>

794
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,500
lenovo cam driver took a while give her

795
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> favor trek getting plenty bo drivers</font>

796
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,880
holy moly and finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same</font>

797
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,740
file that i had in the malware that took

798
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">a while and then finally download it and</font>

799
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,450
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's modified but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

800
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,169
sign so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a signed</font>

801
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:30,900
file that was modified or did the vendor

802
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,640
themselves at it oh got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from do this</font>

803
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,500
and distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anybody heard about</font>

804
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,270
the leno cam driver possibly having a

805
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">backdoor this is what i'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

806
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,280
this is probably an example of that yes

807
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,570
yeah signed by the winnabow it may not

808
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,129
been revoked yet because again i had<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

809
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,350
checked it from that perspective but

810
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,679
first pass it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sign valid file and</font>

811
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:54,209
it kind of looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and again you can</font>

812
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,130
you download on versions anybody tried

813
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,400
to go and get like previous versions of

814
00:32:56,130 --> 00:33:02,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">adobe or winzip or 7-zip or pick a tool</font>

815
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,140
QQ browser kick you<font color="#CCCCCC"> chad and pick a tool</font>

816
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,668
right can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go find all these versions</font>

817
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,320
so that you can actually do a compare

818
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,540
because they're using older stuff it's

819
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's not necessarily</font>

820
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,620
an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in the software there's</font>

821
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,080
a license and hardware restriction

822
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,370
dongles what have you and do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really</font>

823
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do this to an investigation</font>

824
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,959
no sniper forensics you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

825
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,590
we want to find it you want to contain

826
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,600
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on a wrap kit it move</font>

827
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,120
we want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term deep long</font>

828
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,860
expensive time-consuming forensics take

829
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,709
the drive out<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it later we're looking</font>

830
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,459
to find eradicate I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I</font>

831
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:38,620
don't have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them I gotta move on</font>

832
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:42,220
so how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> help what are the</font>

833
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,928
actionable thing so if from a

834
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,580
development perspective we could get

835
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:47,110
software that looks less like malware

836
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:50,350
like good software that looks less like

837
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:52,689
malware that would help us out a lot so

838
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,969
that means marking up your metadata in a

839
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,700
consistent fashion so those things where

840
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,169
we showed you the to do right the the

841
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,020
version numbers that probably are you

842
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,659
know like 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 20 the defaults all of</font>

843
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff the having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal file</font>

844
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,770
name be the same as the external file

845
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,270
name all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things to keep it</font>

you timestamp it against the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAS so</font>

00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:09,339
there's that's a for many of the

the time the products don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it so</font>

make sure that you are time stamping

872
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,359
against your CA so it puts into the code

different signing key use a different

signing certificate for each product and

877
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:36,290
change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out every year at least or</font>

878
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,330
maybe every major product release

879
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:40,759
you should look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

your certificate make it compromised

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,580
your signing certificate make it

00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise your private key if that</font>

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,560
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to revoke</font>

885
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:54,260
your certificate you want to have the

886
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,900
least impact across your product line as

887
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,490
you can you don't want to have your

888
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,110
customers seeing all of your

889
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,479
certificates on all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your products or</font>

890
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,820
revoke do you want to limit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so</font>

891
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,160
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys these these private keys</font>

892
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,650
aren't all that expensive not from a

893
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,230
large company perspective so get one of

894
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:18,020
those each for for each of your products

895
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:20,930
and tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet what is good ish</font>

896
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,630
by publishing your hashes publishing the

897
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,419
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are contained within your all</font>

898
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,580
of your product set right when we did

899
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,500
the Google right we're googling for

900
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,299
something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no source of truth</font>

901
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,460
there's no source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of true saying this is</font>

902
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,710
something that's good now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had the</font>

903
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,300
metadata and we could say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

904
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,870
this file is we know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go look</font>

905
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:44,330
this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dell or this is from Intel</font>

906
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:46,520
or this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company when we go</font>

907
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,960
we could go to maybe your website we can

908
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,600
maybe do a google search and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could</font>

909
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quickly match these things up to</font>

910
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,270
say ah yes it says it's this product it

911
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:58,009
says it's this hash we have a match we

912
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a total match on this stuff so</font>

913
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore we know it's good okay but</font>

914
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,180
without putting that information out

915
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,950
there all we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get is what</font>

916
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,319
some other third-party decided to

917
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:13,299
publish out there like download this

918
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:16,370
free tool to infect your computer and

919
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,170
analyze your stuff to see if it looks

920
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:21,589
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware go through these same same</font>

921
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,900
steps like we do this these very quick

922
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,940
steps to go through it and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does</font>

923
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,190
it come up does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like network if</font>

924
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:30,170
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like our try to design it so</font>

925
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:32,180
that it doesn't so it doesn't hit those

926
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,070
flags so that you're not triggering so

927
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,339
that you're not getting tagged by

928
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:39,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">virustotal is saying one out of 40 or</font>

929
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,390
two out of 40 or three out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 with</font>

930
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,310
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know semantic suspicious</font>

931
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">incite type of triggers</font>

932
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:49,330
so we can go into some detail on that

933
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:52,779
one on the next slide here I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

934
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:55,360
this one so again you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search</font>

935
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,610
from trusted third parties we had one

936
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,780
you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey right yeah you don't</font>

937
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,390
want to buy stuff the turkey because

938
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,970
it's cheaper don't be a turkey you know

939
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,160
turkey and again you know don't use

940
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:09,250
foreign search us company and say we

941
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,540
love you for that by the way yep but hey

942
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,340
there's an advantage right we're an

943
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,720
american company if you have to sign

944
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,460
something with a foreign cert in that

945
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
for a foreign<font color="#E5E5E5"> nation we understand</font>

946
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,800
Russia<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be monitoring the</font>

947
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,200
Olympics they've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> told everybody</font>

948
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,400
and I can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide it and so maybe</font>

949
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,140
that stuff would have to be written

950
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,270
inside of the Russian certificate we

951
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,819
understand but from an IR perspective

952
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,950
your own people's I rrr anybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ir</font>

953
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,090
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it's easier for us</font>

954
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,350
to deal with we can look at their

955
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,560
certificate we can see if it's our boat

956
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:38,049
etc do not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Packers and other leet</font>

957
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">hackers tools for your own stuff yeah</font>

958
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,240
but it's cheaper and free and all that

959
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,090
no no because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people except in will pick</font>

960
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,259
a smiling side now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for this people</font>

961
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,880
like zip ting will pick up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

962
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,900
say something fishy about this file so

963
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to do that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

964
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">use reputable stuff and again funky</font>

965
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,290
naming conventions stop it HP Dell and

966
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,790
pick a few other companies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

967
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,340
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a bummer</font>

968
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that many files that are clean</font>

969
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,820
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we have to build a</font>

970
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,040
list of bad looking stuff that's

971
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,380
actually good<font color="#E5E5E5"> so please name the</font>

972
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,150
internal and the external the same avoid

973
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,710
unnecessary privilege escalations and

974
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,630
you know again don't do things like

975
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,210
install the app data and program data to

976
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,220
try to skirt UAC UAC should come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

977
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,380
there's a reason for it when we find

978
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,689
stuff that's written to there we

979
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,070
definitely look at it more closely and

980
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,060
then we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a call to you</font>

981
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,320
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask you for this</font>

982
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,830
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

983
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,570
don't keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> info we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

984
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,860
know somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adobe so I reached out and</font>

985
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them hey can we get a list of your</font>

986
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,789
hashes for CS products because you know

987
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,549
by a company policy we do not provide

988
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:50,460
hashes to anyone so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

989
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:52,038
straight you've got like Brad loads of

990
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,599
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you won't tell us what's good</font>

991
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:56,369
hmm methinks they have had a problem

992
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,249
with that and who has compromised

993
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:00,839
certificates yeah gee I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

994
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know you're the skirting just</font>

995
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:07,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying so again you know has access to</font>

996
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,868
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your favorite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code base right so</font>

997
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:11,549
protect your building arm too often<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

998
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">see built environments that are on the</font>

999
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:15,329
same network as everybody else who's

1000
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:19,589
administrators and such if they bought

1001
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:21,329
one of your boxes hello mid 90 or say

1002
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:23,519
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adobe they're going to get into</font>

1003
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:25,170
the repositories bad design shouldn't do

1004
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,379
this this is the keys your cast of your

1005
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,029
code your good stuff probably has all

1006
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,400
your stupid private keys there too so

1007
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,869
they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there boom done a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nines</font>

1008
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">case at least the vm was powered down</font>

1009
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,109
for what six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months before it powered up</font>

1010
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:39,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the data went out</font>

1011
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:40,558
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you lose your code nobody</font>

1012
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:42,509
will ever know because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1013
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,190
managing this in the right method you're

1014
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:46,259
not doing what we're saying here because

1015
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,200
we did you could very quickly revoke

1016
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:51,479
that ink form cert patch and update and

1017
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,930
now this stuff would flag and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit9 and</font>

1018
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:56,519
AV something fierce and again if you

1019
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:00,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">lose your search will know because it'll</font>

1020
00:40:56,519 --> 00:41:02,249
become more common to report them and

1021
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,959
again if you didn't take this action

1022
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:05,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">revoke will soon you didn't know you</font>

1023
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,529
were compromised and of course things

1024
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:11,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">get worse just ask these three vendors</font>

1025
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:14,190
yep so from those who are concerned

1026
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,869
about security from a I don't want the

1027
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:20,489
public to know and pay a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

1028
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:22,410
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach you you know I see not a lot</font>

1029
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:24,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">of effort being put on securing a build</font>

1030
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:26,129
environment because you say well ok it's

1031
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:27,509
a code and the codes everywhere right

1032
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,329
the codes on developer machines you

1033
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:32,400
codes all over the place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it</font>

1034
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:34,950
might as easily get popped over here as

1035
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,859
it does on this build machine but which

1036
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:40,468
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe true if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't protect that</font>

1037
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:44,400
environment well but if they steal your

1038
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:45,779
certificate right then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1039
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,160
be known somebody steals your code they

1040
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:50,069
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not go and put it out and paste bin</font>

1041
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,989
or some<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some site 24 and share</font>

1042
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:53,339

1045
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,450
share that out so it may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> become</font>

public knowledge that your code has been

1047
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:02,430
stolen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if they take your certificate</font>

1048
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,740
what are they taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it forward they're</font>

1049
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,020
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to use it they will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font>

1050

it out to somebody it will show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

us are going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at some point</font>

1053
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,730
go ah you were compromised and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1054
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,880
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking questions all right as soon</font>

1055
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">as that is known then that's going to</font>

1056
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,430
trigger you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party</font>

1057
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:29,730
reporting you've been compromised what's

1058
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:32,069
going on and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breach engine the</font>

1059
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,650
response engine kicks in and the dollars

1060
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,510
start you know having an impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> right on</font>

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">trillian sensation right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mandiant will</font>

1062

love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> both so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even if you don't care</font>

1063
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,270
about your code at least protect your

1064
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,650
build environment because you build

1065
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:48,540
environment hazard is going to have your

1066
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:50,970
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> key on it so what can you do to</font>

1067
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,450
protect it keep those private<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys</font>

1068
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:57,899
offline if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit your code</font>

1069
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:00,000
access limit anything that you can do to

1070
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">help protect that production environment</font>

1071
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,640
maybe you have a separate production

1072
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:08,430
versus test internal test build system

1073
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,480
right maybe you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well we can't</font>

1074
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can't have all this stuff</font>

1075
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,030
off line we got to have this you know

1076
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,140
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time right we're doing</font>

1077
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:17,340
compiles are doing continuous

1078
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,750
integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay awesome but how often</font>

1079
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,400
are you pushing code out to customers

1080
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,320
how often do you actually say this is

1081
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the final code we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font>

1082
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and go live with this one bring up that</font>

1083
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,880
secure environment do what you need

1084
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,919
there's your private key generate your

1085
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,320
certs check everything make sure

1086
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,320
everything's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go yeah</font>

1087
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,020
nobody would ever ship infected code or

1088
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,270
something with bad juju on it knowingly

1089
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,650
right nobody would ever do that because

1090
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,220
they don't have a good code repository

1091
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,300
HP we both work somewhere that did that

1092
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,890
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> HP's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done at the printer</font>

1093
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,840
drivers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens because they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1094
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:53,609
protecting that that compiled pelo

1095
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,010
they're not taking that copy offline

1096
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,780
yeah keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know test live blah</font>

1097
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,430
blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> why not not find Travie place</font>

1098
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,000
I worked you couldn't get into that

1099
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,859
environment you try you literally

1100
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">there it burned a CD he walked it over</font>

1101
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,400
he analyzed the heck out of it made sure

1102
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,990
it was exactly what it was and then he

1103
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,670
build the software from that in an

1104
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:12,700
environment which got boxed and shipped

1105
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:16,780
or downloaded very controlled not a lot

1106
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:20,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so with that thank you</font>

1107
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions comments with brainstorm not</font>

1108
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:33,070
too hard huh so something you could

1109
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:36,310
actually do question about the four then

1110
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:38,770
five children or<font color="#CCCCCC"> hitting on yeah I would</font>

1111
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,630
just go straight with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-1 and then if</font>

1112
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,630
you want you can do the chocolate 56

1113
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:45,310
shop whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think right now what</font>

1114
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,200
I'm seeing across the board is it still

1115
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,060
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one and I think it's</font>

1116
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,560
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remain shot one for a while but</font>

1117
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,240
you can there's no reason to not just go

1118
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,799
ahead and pin and include the islands

1119
00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:02,350
md5 using that much anymore help laws

1120
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:04,900
that have posted oh absolutely yeah yeah

1121
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,089
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to be for every individual I</font>

1122
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,890
would do ever I would every file in the

1123
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,510
package just everything and listed all

1124
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:12,910
out you know like little directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree</font>

1125
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,800
type format or whatever but just you

1126
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:17,290
know put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right on there if it's</font>

1167
00:46:55,930 --> 00:47:03,259
human hands how strict rule is that how

1168
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:05,690
scriptable is this yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that's</font>

1169
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,490
the thing we're building thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

doing a hands-on training all day it

1175
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,490
will kind of be theoretically split into

1176
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,140
two pieces the entry-level kind of

1177
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:29,660
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will do be providing let's</font>

1178
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,460
talk about some stuff and you'll see

example in the example we had a racer

1183
