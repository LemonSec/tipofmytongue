4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,920
exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come spend</font>

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,900
an hour so here excuse me this picture

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Konzelman road</font>

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,320
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> across the golden gate bridge</font>

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">just north of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San Francisco it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,420
my favorite places on earth I do a lot

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">of running up there it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,440
for bikers just sightseers you can see

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,110
you get these great views of the bay and

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,059
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific Ocean and up here if you</font>

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,129
turn around actually do a 180 from about

15
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:00,290
where this picture was taken you are

16
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">about well I level with the top of the</font>

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,220
Golden Gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bridge that's pretty neat</font>

18
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,740
it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessible so they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tourists up there but you can see</font>

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,720
it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> gnarly one way one lane</font>

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,200
road that's pretty twisty and and that

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hill gets pretty steep at times and of</font>

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,580
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you make a wrong turn you're</font>

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,759
going to be swimming but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years</font>

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago is actually more dangerous than then</font>

26
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,539
that looks right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the asphalt was</font>

27
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,640
pretty chewed up it was a pretty

28
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:32,960
commonplace for bike accidents to happen

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,359
bicyclists would would plant their tire

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,109
in a pothole go over the handlebars in

31
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,460
there's usually no fun ensuing the

32
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,289
National Park Service this is actually

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,630
part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the National Recreation Area</font>

34
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,909
they did a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice job at cleaning</font>

35
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,189
this area they repaved it you see the

36
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice new asphalt here we got you know</font>

37
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,630
brand new marker lines and reflectors

38
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,759
and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some traffic circles down</font>

39
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,339
where there's some interchanges and you

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,020
have these nice guardrails and to me I

41
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,869
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's sort of the perfect</font>

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,810
analogy for security folks when we think

43
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we approach security and</font>

44
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,729
environments that are embracing

45
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,000
technologies and approaches like agile

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,310
or cloud or DevOps these these kinds of

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,870
things they're not they don't adapt well

48
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,940
if you think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional security</font>

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,250
model which was tends to be based around

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,500
gates where you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of</font>

51
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,330
code or an application that would would

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,069
be inspected at various points someone

53
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,290
would decide when if something got to

54
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,369
move to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gate</font>

55
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,709
if you were to apply that kind of

56
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,750
approach to this Konzelman<font color="#E5E5E5"> road use case</font>

57
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,450
you probably end up with with stop

58
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,870
lights instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic circles with</font>

59
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,609
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tall boots instead of guardrails</font>

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,860
what we do at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix is we take more of</font>

61
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,260
that the mindset of let's move fast and

62
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,079
let's stay safe and that's what I want

63
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about today I won't get too</font>

64
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,159
prescriptive just because everybody's

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,529
different Netflix<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a unique place I'm</font>

66
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,690
sure where you guys work is all unique

67
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,260
have your own constraints and text acts

68
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,970
but what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do is kind of give</font>

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,010
a sense of how we think about this

70
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,450
problem how we approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it give some</font>

71
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,548
examples of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the stuff that we've</font>

72
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,349
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully you get either</font>

73
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,579
get some ideas or maybe get some

74
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,510
validation for something that you've

75
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,970
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> done or working on so I'm Jason</font>

76
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,349
I work at Netflix I'm a engineering

77
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,109
director there what my team is

78
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,760
responsible for is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of the</font>

79
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,180
streaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> video service though things</font>

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,040
like Ops security app security incident

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,650
response monitoring all that fun stuff

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,668
but we get to work on before I've been

83
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">at Netflix about two and half years</font>

84
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,319
before that i led<font color="#CCCCCC"> the info SEC team at</font>

85
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and spent most of my earlier</font>

86
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,510
career as a consultant security

87
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,459
consultant at a few different places

88
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:49,888
Netflix if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar is it's a</font>

89
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,319
streaming video service what we do is

90
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,419
take the TV shows and the movies that

91
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch and deliver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font>

92
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,560
you over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet you can watch on</font>

93
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,449
pretty much any device you like without

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,590
ads without interruptions for one price

95
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:09,180
that's that's what we do so let's

96
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:11,310
introductions hi so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to bundle</font>

97
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,769
these words together kind of buzzwords

98
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,918
afternoon things like agile continuous

99
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,090
deployment cloud DevOps I'm bundling

100
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,190
them together not because their

101
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,988
particular similar or for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you</font>

102
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't see an organization doing agile</font>

103
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,039
development that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing cloud they</font>

104
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,260
can be separated each one of these are

105
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,870
complex topics that warrant their own

106
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,750
conferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> I bundle them together</font>

107
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,970
because to me organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

108
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,979
embracing these approaches and

109
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,710
technologies have certain

110
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,419
characteristics and those certain

111
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,430
characteristics make

112
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,790
more traditional approach to product

113
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,690
security it's not as adaptable I'm going

114
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just call out two main</font>

115
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,570
characteristics that I see both at

116
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,600
Netflix in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my previous</font>

117
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:58,110
experience the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first characteristic is</font>

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,970
speed this this handsome fellow is a

119
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,200
guinea fowl I don't know if you've been

120
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,900
lucky enough to see one of these in

121
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,050
person he's rushing off to an important

122
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting but organizations that are doing</font>

123
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,250
agile they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving fast and you can</font>

124
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,780
you can take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mean a number of</font>

125
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,700
things their releases happen more often

126
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe they happen every day multiple</font>

127
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,909
times a day maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once a week the</font>

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">release process itself also tends to be</font>

129
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,510
collapsed and faster you don't have this

130
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,130
idea of a big bang release where you got

131
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut everything down for 12 hours</font>

132
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,120
pushing new code restart everything they

133
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to have the idea of a one-button</font>

134
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,220
deploy and then when I put my security

135
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,870
had on if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell me well</font>

136
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,870
things move fast everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is changing</font>

137
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,850
all the time to me that means well my

138
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,110
attack surface is changing what I see

139
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,430
today is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what I saw</font>

140
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,470
yesterday it's different from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

141
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,660
be out there a month from now so we need

142
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,120
to change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we think to be able to</font>

143
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle that kind of situation so that's</font>

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,360
one characteristic the second

145
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:57,600
characteristic<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would call out is scale</font>

146
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,520
and these organizations that are doing

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,990
cloud they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> devops they tend to</font>

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,299
be bigger they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be have more</font>

149
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,610
systems more applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> more engineers</font>

150
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,760
more complexity you get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of</font>

151
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,860
distributed systems and serving a global

152
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,870
audience so we have these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

153
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,330
when we when we think about scale what

154
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,070
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean for security there's a</font>

155
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of stuff right there's there's</font>

156
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,370
there's a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test a lot of</font>

157
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to evaluate a lot of code to</font>

158
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,610
review a lot of developers to provide

159
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:31,680
security traded for so we have speed and

160
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,810
scale but my thesis is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font>

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of new approaches these</font>

162
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,250
new technologies bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> along speed and</font>

163
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,010
scale the old way of doing security

164
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,470
doesn't fit particularly well with this

165
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:46,050
new approach what are what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

166
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,270
to do about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do we adapt and</font>

167
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,530
then I have basically three ways I'm

168
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,820
sure you could you could slice this

169
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,419
differently but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present</font>

170
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,248
three things first remember this band

171
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,139
first

172
00:06:55,249 --> 00:07:01,509
I'll call culture it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

173
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,699
culture if your company has moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

174
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,619
releasing every week or every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

175
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,389
moving fast what they're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they</font>

176
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:10,219
want to roll out new features they want

177
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,339
to test new things they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

178
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,259
innovative<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate then for us</font>

179
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,359
as security people to say uh well let's

180
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,369
let's stay with the old way let's have

181
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,558
our security hammer and let's be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor</font>

182
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:23,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and let's shut things down and</font>

183
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:25,029
command and<font color="#CCCCCC"> control you know I can be</font>

184
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:27,679
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I would argue that</font>

185
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:29,749
culturally security wise as teams we

186
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:31,789
need to adapt we need to understand what

187
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,329
the business is trying to do and let's

188
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:37,729
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> along with it let's not fight</font>

189
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:39,199
second thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is visibility when things</font>

190
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:43,998
are moving fast and things are really

191
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,649
big and you have you know 24 7 with with

192
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,360
ops or security you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

193
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:50,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of visibility you need to know</font>

194
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,189
where do I know where all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my systems are</font>

195
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:54,199
do I know where my sensitive data is do

196
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,269
I know where my sensitive code is do I

197
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,919
know the events that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening in</font>

198
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,479
particular apps that have some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

199
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,669
relevance to me as a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

200
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,438
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really that visibility throughout</font>

201
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,089
that stack throughout all the different

202
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,429
characteristics that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font>

203
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,529
we have culture we have visibility last

204
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:12,138
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not least is automation this is</font>

205
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you probably get a guest with</font>

206
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,549
large systems thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems</font>

207
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,360
hundreds of apps doing things manually

208
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:22,128
having checklists keeping spreadsheets

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,269
your there's a mean for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

210
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:24,709
probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a good time</font>

211
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">right if that's your approach so</font>

212
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,860
automation is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that third piece</font>

213
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,849
we have culture visibility automation

214
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,659
and that's what no one I want to talk

215
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is how do we I guess implement</font>

216
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,328
that as Netflix what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to combat</font>

217
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,620
this idea will not combat I think

218
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,540
competi is the wrong word but how do we

219
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,579
adapt to the speed and scale through

220
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,980
these three through three kind of

221
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,989
approaches first just a little bit of

222
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,629
background on the netflix environment

223
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,500
just to kind of get a sense of what we

224
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:59,629
deal with we did we do probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> on any</font>

225
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,870
given day rough order magnitude about

226
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:04,339
200 pushes to production every day if

227
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,529
we're working on something large that

228
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,600
maybe works across many teams that could

229
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,970
go up to 500 600

230
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,019
it's not really bound it doesn't really

231
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an upper bound it could be</font>

232
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,160
different types of year where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

233
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,870
lower but there's a lot of change we

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,120
have over 40 million subscribers and

235
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,680
these are paying subscribers so they're

236
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just free users of the site they're</font>

237
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,430
paying money for the service they expect

238
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do be available they expect us to</font>

239
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,500
protect their data we support over a

240
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,939
thousand different devices which brings

241
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,130
a lot of complexity in terms of you I

242
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,810
and interoperability when you think

243
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,790
about most sites what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have you</font>

244
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,380
have a you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a main website maybe you</font>

245
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,389
have like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone app</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any</font>

246
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,490
Android app so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're supporting a</font>

247
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,980
few we have a thousand different devices

248
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,319
we have smart TVs and blu-ray players

249
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,699
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox that all have a Netflix app so</font>

250
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,790
there's just a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of code out there a</font>

251
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:53,990
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complexity and interoperability</font>

252
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,870
we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> service in 40 different</font>

253
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,690
countries and that you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

254
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,329
localization internationalization also

255
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,560
on the security side you have all these

256
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,109
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> markets that have their own</font>

257
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,670
kind of notions of fraud and risk they

258
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,920
have their own payment<font color="#CCCCCC"> instruments some</font>

259
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,139
places prefer direct debit to credit

260
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,240
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> some places like PayPal and there</font>

261
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:15,889
are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of country specific</font>

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,300
ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

263
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:22,550
adapt to and then we deliver our service

264
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,079
from three different amazon regions so

265
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,910
we're primarily an Amazon Web Services

266
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,258
public cloud if you don't you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

267
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,959
familiar with the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an Amazon</font>

268
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,220
region it's roughly equivalent to a

269
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,920
group of data centers that are

270
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,360
geographically close for example

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,759
Northern Virginia they have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

272
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,470
data center san francisco dublin ireland

273
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,720
and those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the places that we operate</font>

274
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,819
and we deliver our service concurrently

275
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,730
out of those three regions and we have

276
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:49,880
global replication of member data to all

277
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,220
those regions and then just pure

278
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,500
bandwidth wise when we're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> our peak of</font>

279
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,959
usage about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-third of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s.</font>

280
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,689

281
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,729
treat so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty big pretty big</font>

282
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:05,180
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast-moving service there's a</font>

283
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,370
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things changing so first let's</font>

284
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,800
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with culture the culture at</font>

285
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,019
Netflix is something that we hold pretty

286
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,310
near and dear it's if you want to if

287
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,439
you're interested you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to our</font>

288
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:18,138
website we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like a hundred and</font>

289
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,939
twenty slide presentation about the

290
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:21,870
netflix culture it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

291
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:24,180
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular like HR</font>

292
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,660
recruiting and MBA programs will study

293
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,040
it so certainly feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to check it</font>

294
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">out if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested I'll sum it up</font>

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,959
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a couple words and it's really</font>

296
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,060
freedom and responsibility of you with

297
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,500
that what we try to do is we hire really

298
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,109
good people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are experts in their</font>

299
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,880
area then you give them freedom to solve

300
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,440
the problems in their domain and then

301
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,820
you also give them responsibility for

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,810
the success of those solutions to those

303
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,520
problems so there's accountability

304
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,459
there's freedom to do things how you

305
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,170
want to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it needs to work and</font>

306
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,400
you'll be accountable for whether it

307
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,079
does work to me that that that cultural

308
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,569
model works really well with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of</font>

309
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,800
agile and DevOps and continuous

310
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:06,690
deployment this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of the anti</font>

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,719
DevOps culture slide right passing the

<font color="#E5E5E5">buck and DevOps is different things to</font>

313
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,140
different people I won't try to define

314
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,449
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we implement it</font>

315
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,980
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will call it no ops but the</font>

316
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,510
way we operate is we have engineering

317
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,930
teams that have maybe two people maybe

318
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:25,439
have eight people and that team manages

319
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,060
one or two services or three so they'll

320
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,830
work with product managers in terms of

321
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,329
requirements but they're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

322
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,980
writing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code they're responsible for</font>

323
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,050
deploying the code they're responsible

324
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating the code when that you</font>

325
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,630
know the hypothetical thing goes bump in

326
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,100
the night they're the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> who get</font>

327
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,410
called so it's just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> team there's</font>

328
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,200
nobody else it's it's them and when you

329
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,290
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that you there's there's a</font>

330
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,170
lot of built-in desire to write reliable

331
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,849
code they're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all the in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the requirements all of what</font>

333
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,160
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would call the non-functional</font>

334
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,680
requirements as well things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

335
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,480
availability performance security it's

<font color="#E5E5E5">not my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team's responsibility to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

337
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,930
every security bug and fix every

338
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,630
security bug every team owns their own

339
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,189
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their system obviously we're</font>

340
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,689
there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expect everybody</font>

341
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,680
to be a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> expert that's what</font>

342
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,020
we're therefore we also have a

343
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,349
performance team that that serves a

344
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,750
similar role but culturally I think

345
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,240
we're set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> well for this kind of these</font>

346
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,400
kinds of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and it's another one</font>

347
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where if you want to do these kinds</font>

348
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,120
of things like DevOps it and you'll read

349
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,150
about you know if you've read gene Kim's

350
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,220
book or any of the blogs out there you

351
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a technology</font>

352
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,640
thing it's very cultural another thing

353
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've done is we rolled out of</font>

354
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,120
responsible disclosure program<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

355
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:43,860
last year so we basically get bugs from

356
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,360
external researchers they report them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

357
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,110
us what we found is that this has helped

358
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,300
a lot in terms of letting the engineers

359
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,930
understand how their systems might be

360
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,490
attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> because these are real people</font>

361
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there finding bugs and sending them</font>

362
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,260
to us and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just got this sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

363
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">just thought it was kind of neat people</font>

364
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,420
walk by and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of wonder what's going</font>

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,250
on but it's also held because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if most</font>

366
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,900
engineers have worked at companies where

367
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship with security is a</font>

368
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,829
little bit more combative a little more

369
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,640
adversarial I think this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

370
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,720
approach helps us you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lets</font>

371
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,340
the engineers know that we're on their

372
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,570
side let's work together let's keep

373
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:29,100
things safe anybody any Archer fans in

374
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,660
the room yeah I recommend if you if you

375
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,500
haven't seen archer it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> available on</font>

376
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Netflix it's not appropriate for</font>

377
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,250
children but it is a cartoon but it's

378
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:44,160
very funny next is the idea of

379
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,380
recruiting how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> recruit for these</font>

380
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,750
kinds of organizations this is supposed

381
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Venn diagram but it's that's the</font>

382
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:54,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea what I try to do when I pitch to a</font>

383
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,010
candidate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I'm trying to hire</font>

384
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,480
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what is it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to work in</font>

385
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,920
the security team what kind of skills do

386
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,370
you need this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how I think</font>

387
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things with dev ops and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

388
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,150
agile you kind of you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

389
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,740
new this new term<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people will call</font>

390
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,209
they'll say the full stack engineer

391
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,000
somebody who understands you know maybe

392
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,070
front-end back-end systems and with

393
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,300
security in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last maybe five to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

394
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,730
years there's been more of a push

395
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,949
towards specialization and less less

396
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,830
generalists I actually kind of moved the

397
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,690
other way in that I don't want folks who

398
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,190
are really supreme specialists I mean

399
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,360
those people are obviously talented and

400
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,360
those skills are required in a lot of

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">positions for us what is successful is</font>

402
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,810
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has some who has dabbled in</font>

403
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,699
some of these areas maybe they've

404
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,500
they've done app sec maybe they've

405
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,030
worked in online operations for a large

406
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,190
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how those</font>

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys of organizations work they've done</font>

408
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,400
cloud maybe they've done incident

409
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,470
response that's kind of what we look for

410
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,110
and really the unifying bit in the

411
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">middle the idea of development is</font>

412
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,459
I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't imagine anybody being</font>

413
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,990
successful without the ability to write

414
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,939
code without the ability to build tools

415
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,290
for themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the team not</font>

416
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily that there they've been</font>

417
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">full-time developers but certainly need</font>

418
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,130
that skill set I think of my team about

419
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:08,370
half of the folks I have at one time was

420
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,450
were full-time developers just got to

421
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:14,370
give a sense for how the team is

422
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:17,790
composed and then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last bid</font>

423
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,980
on culture since we operate with

424
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,310
engineering teams that have adopted you

425
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,860
know agile scrum whatever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually as</font>

426
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,079
a team operate in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode as well so</font>

427
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,940
we use the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprints we have a two</font>

428
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,339
weeks print model and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

429
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,010
organize and prioritize our work what we

430
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,810
found is it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to make</font>

431
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,980
what we're working on visible to the

432
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,380
team and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest of the organization</font>

433
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,000
what the priorities are this is JIRA

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,140
this is what we use for bug tracking at

435
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,120
work tracking your pot you might be

436
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,050
familiar with this kind of three lane

437
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,670
thing basically represents you know what

438
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,899
are you waiting to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on what</font>

439
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,319
are you currently working on what has

440
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:57,269
been complete in a given sprint we have

441
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">per user filters so it's really easy to</font>

442
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,810
click on Jason to see well what's Jason

443
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,049
working on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what is he completed</font>

444
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,938
what is Sam doing and then also this is

445
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:08,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's called greenhopper or</font>

446
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,770
agile board and it has some really nice

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,410
easy planning and reporting we kind of

448
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,270
just used it out of the box but the team

449
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:17,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">has been there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good feedback</font>

450
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">on using it you know as the team gets a</font>

451
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,880
little bit bigger it's hard to know what

452
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,660
everybody's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and this provides</font>

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:30,150
a really nice way of making that visible

454
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:32,460
speaking of visibility certainly with a

455
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:36,059
visit with with security with operations

456
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,190
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visibility is critical to</font>

457
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:41,250
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be successful at your</font>

458
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,950
job whether it's again knowing where the

459
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,630
systems are knowing where the data is so

460
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

461
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of security dashboards right</font>

462
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,480
everybody has a security dashboard we

463
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,980
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few different dashboards this</font>

464
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,780
right here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a we're actually what</font>

465
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,210
we're looking at here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cloud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM</font>

466
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,710
dashboard cloudy<font color="#CCCCCC"> HSM is a service in</font>

467
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Amazon that basically provides you a</font>

468
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,710
hard

469
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,750
our security module accessible in the

470
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,670
cloud and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I want to talk a little</font>

471
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,280
bit about how we think about designing

472
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,530
the dashboard and what kind of went into

473
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,210
it what we wanted to do was provide a

474
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,399
single place where anybody on the team

475
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,870
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to to get all the metrics and</font>

476
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,570
all the data on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the systems are</font>

477
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,340
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and all the systems that</font>

478
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:26,810
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of security impact things</font>

479
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,100
like payments or or logins so what we

480
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,690
have over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the idea of a sub</font>

481
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,760
dashboard because maybe you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

482
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,070
at just production maybe just test maybe

483
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,990
a particular region we have the ability

484
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,970
to drill down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a particular region in</font>

485
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,350
Amazon and then also look back I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

486
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,590
we go we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about two weeks</font>

487
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,870
with this interface up at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top there</font>

488
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,330
are the different dashboards for the

489
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,010
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were responsible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for so we</font>

490
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,159
have for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security intelligence</font>

491
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,470
dashboard VPC which is the Amazons<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

492
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual private cloud we have our crypto</font>

493
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,670
and key management dashboard drm

494
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,220
dashboard and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's also</font>

495
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,140
dashboards for other services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

496
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate but have some kind of</font>

497
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,720
security impact of things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-comm</font>

498
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,660
payments customer service for example we

499
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">want we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know are we having an</font>

500
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,120
order number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> password reset emails</font>

501
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,680
being sent what our customers calling

502
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,239
about like are they calling because

503
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,430
maybe they've gotten locked out or they

504
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,690
have some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of account problems are</font>

505
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,520
we having problems with our payment

506
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,200
processors we want to provide visibility

507
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,100
to all that from one place so this is an

508
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of what we've done and of course</font>

509
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,030
dashboards are really useful for that ad

510
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,860
hoc analysis let me go poke at things

511
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and kind of explore maybe</font>

512
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,050
look back but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also as a security</font>

513
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">person you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to be alerted</font>

514
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">when something happens you I need to</font>

515
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">know hey something happened let's</font>

516
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,050
investigate and the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have thought</font>

517
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,020
about alerting because it's you know

518
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty complicated distributed system we</font>

519
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,360
don't want sort of random apps sending

520
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,830
us emails to random distribution lists

521
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,659
we want to we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be tightly</font>

522
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,929
integrated with the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

523
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,180
escalations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> notifications so we</font>

524
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,380
don't want everybody to get a particular

525
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">llort we want the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is on call</font>

526
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,580
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alert and if they have chosen</font>

527
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,870
to get an SMS message or a push

528
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,490
notification or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

529
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,290
or a phone call that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

530
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,790
deliver that<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert so we have a</font>

531
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,550
centralized alerting system that helps

532
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:26,480
us do that and this right here is an

533
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,950
example of an email alert and I'll walk

534
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,180
through some of I guess the design or

535
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,160
the requirements here and this is

536
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an HSM alert so we're looking</font>

537
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,630
at the cloud each of them dashboard this

538
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,090
is an HSM alert what we do is we want to

539
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a meaningful subject for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the alert</font>

540
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:44,750
and you see here well in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prada Cal</font>

541
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,030
and US East one we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a request</font>

542
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:50,000
increase for our h SMS what that means

543
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,010
is the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you expected to have</font>

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to your hardware security module is</font>

545
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,730
actually increased that might be

546
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at who knows this is</font>

547
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,280
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test alert regenerated it doesn't</font>

548
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually represent any real data but</font>

549
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,639
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this email does is it shows you</font>

550
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,440
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the alert configuration is like</font>

551
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,840
what expression match that caused this

552
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,330
alert to get generated we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have here</font>

553
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,709
sorry it's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an eye chart</font>

554
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,840
but what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do well I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

555
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,540
alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what next and you'll see it</font>

556
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,220
says here<font color="#E5E5E5"> quad hsm requests have</font>

557
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,170
increased at least twenty percent please

558
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,760
check the cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> HSM dashboard and the</font>

559
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,260
crypto key management dashboard and

560
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,879
you'll see here we actually have links

561
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,140
to those dashboards so it's not like oh

562
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,740
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember well what's that</font>

563
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">URL what link do i click we embed those</font>

564
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,220
links that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the Edit</font>

565
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,950
graph embedded to so you kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

566
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,960
if you're on call you're out you have

567
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,100
your iphone or whatever you pop that up

568
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,809
and you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have everything on</font>

569
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,070
one screen and you kind of decide what

570
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:47,660
you need to do neck alerts are great for

571
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,090
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know informing you of something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

though<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecurity sometimes you don't</font>

to go poke around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do investigate</font>

576
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,360
for me it based on my experience if

577
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,320
something if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think something's going</font>

578
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">on security-wise operations wise the</font>

579
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,428
first thing I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know is what has</font>

580
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,309
changed if I see something today that

581
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,690
didn't exist exist yesterday well what

582
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:16,190
happened did<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody push a new version</font>

583
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,790
of code did somebody change the load

584
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:22,160
balance or some ssl certificate so we

585
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,409
have a tool called Chronos I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

586
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,480
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a timeline system if</font>

587
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,460
somebody pushes code that event gets

588
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,960
written into kronos so somebody changes

589
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,460
well config it gets written into kronos

590
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,520
you can write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own custom events</font>

591
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,960
there what this screen is doing that

592
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,260
lets you drill in and a particular

593
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:42,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">application a particular time frame what</font>

594
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,120
this query does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just say hey let</font>

595
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,729
me look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. west to region in</font>

596
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,949
AWS which is basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portland</font>

597
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,360
region and look back for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hour</font>

598
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,620
show me all the events that happen to

599
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,899
the last hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see here I've got</font>

600
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,090
about 24 event so I could look through

601
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,740
there see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if anything seems fishy does</font>

602
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,320
anything there seem like it matches what

603
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,530
I'm looking at so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pretty neat</font>

604
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,480
tool but part of visibility is you also

605
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,860
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reach people when</font>

606
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,170
they need information where they need

607
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,070
information we're pretty heavy users of

608
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,450
chat like group chat and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-on-one</font>

609
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,580
so we've written a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

610
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS chat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS that can get different</font>

611
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,730
information so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the chat</font>

612
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,860
room and somebody says oh well something

613
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,410
looks weird so I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run this</font>

614
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,909
command<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all the pushes for</font>

this particular app in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last three</font>

days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the last week and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots will</font>

617
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,440
go retrieve that information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so</font>

618
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,970
you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump out to some</font>

619
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,590
application and figure things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

620
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's our chat bot we have a series of</font>

621
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:42,760
those the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to cover</font>

622
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,950
visibility wise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of interesting</font>

623
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:50,320
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keynote yo Nick was</font>

624
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:53,000
talking some about NSA I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

625
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,560
was invited by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA a couple years</font>

626
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,770
ago to talk to them at headquarters

627
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud security I probably wouldn't</font>

628
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,340
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the invitation if it was made</font>

629
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,399
today but given some of the revelations

630
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,320
but any<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rate it was unclassified so</font>

631
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,420
but I basically went there and kind of

632
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave my spiel about cloud security what</font>

633
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,350
I thought you know they they were pretty

634
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">quiet like not a lot of introductions I</font>

635
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,060
don't exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's in the room</font>

636
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,190
didn't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ton of questions but all</font>

637
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,649
their questions that they did have and

638
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,780
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably laugh given given all</font>

639
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,120
the Snowden stuff was about integrity of

640
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,430
software and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you validate and</font>

641
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,199
verify the integrity of software in

642
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,810
these kinds of environments if you're

643
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,430
making 200 pushes a day how do you know

644
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,020
what you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> in production is</font>

645
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,560
actually what you want it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be hasn't</font>

646
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,730
been back doored what has gone into that

647
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I I mean</font>

648
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:47,840
good question so one of the things we

649
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,580
built was a tool called me mere and me

650
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,760
mere is really intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

651
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,980
deployment automation tool workflow tool

652
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,720
to help people deploy code really

653
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficiently to multiple regions and</font>

654
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,250
multiple environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a side effect</font>

655
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:04,429
what it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is provide a really nice</font>

656
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,740
amount of traceability to your code this

657
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,640
is the me mere dashboard this is an app

658
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,950
that we run my team runs called lemur

659
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,200
it's basically a tool that tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

660
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,090
configurations so we run this we run in

661
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">tests you see the apt name up there I'm</font>

662
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to kind of walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through a few</font>

663
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,850
screens to give you a sense for how this

664
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,590
works we use Jenkins which is a build

665
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,559
system it's a it's a continuous

666
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,820
integration system and this is the job

667
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,678
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could click in there and get to the</font>

668
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,600
Jenkins job that's how our code gets

669
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:37,730
built so what somebody changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co to</font>

670
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,830
build runs it produces it artifact down

671
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,020
here it shows what you're currently

672
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,549
running clusters are so you'll see I

673
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,100
actually have two clusters here one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

674
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:48,679
them shows version 11 shows down version

675
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,299
12 is up so it's showing me this is what

676
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,799
you currently have deployed we only run

677
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:53,900
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tests because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a test</font>

678
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:57,320
application but if you were running<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

679
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,059
prod you would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have prod boxes so</font>

680
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,649
version 12 is what I'm running<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

681
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,899
let me see what's going in there so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

682
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,450
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link i would get this screen</font>

683
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,960
and this screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see there there's a</font>

684
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,820
cluster ID lemur version 12 it has the

685
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,220
deployment details when was it deployed

686
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,620
the date and time what region what

687
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,470
environment it has the ami version and

688
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,418
ami is also an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon term it's Amazon</font>

689
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,179
machine image you can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as the</font>

690
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">template from which your cluster gets</font>

691
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:29,270
deployed and also it has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SCM</font>

692
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,330
commit so has the source code commit

693
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,668
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused this bill to be created the</font>

694
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:38,449
way that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our systems work is if</font>

695
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:40,429
a developer commits a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change</font>

696
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,990
will then kick off a build job that bill

697
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,760
job will create a new artifact and

698
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here is</font>

699
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,290
saying well this this build was created

700
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:51,918
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this source code change if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I click</font>

701
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,139
that link that pops me into stash which

702
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,640
is our internal git repo and

703
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,770
you see what file has changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

704
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,890
see what the actual source dips are this

705
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:03,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just kind of a BS change just to</font>

706
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,810
demonstrate all I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was change some of</font>

707
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> markdown on this readme but you see</font>

708
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,870
you can see it highlights everything and

709
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,240
then also it actually links to the

710
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,770
Darrell event<font color="#E5E5E5"> JIRA so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

711
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,440
click there I see well there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Giro</font>

712
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:18,470
so what you can do is going backwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

713
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,150
can see you know why do you change code

714
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,610
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bug you have a new feature</font>

715
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that starts in JIRA that's where we come</font>

716
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,840
that's where we is really the source of

717
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,190
everything going backwards then you can

718
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,659
see in source code where you actually

719
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,070
checked in the change you can review all

720
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,510
the changes if there were any code

721
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,460
reviews that would also be linked right

722
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,990
from there you can go to the bill job

723
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,640
that actually generated<font color="#E5E5E5"> that code and</font>

724
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,170
then all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to production or test</font>

725
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see well how is that running so</font>

726
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,870
there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice amount of</font>

727
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,420
traceability for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so it's not</font>

728
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,949
really you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wonder well well</font>

729
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:51,260
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that system because it's all</font>

730
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:54,460
very it's all very visible next is I

731
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,170
will talk about automation a little bit

732
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give a few examples certainly</font>

733
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,320
there are lots of different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

734
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,810
automation wise one of the things I want

735
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,950
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is canary testing so when</font>

736
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,510
you make a change in security or code

737
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,840
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide whether that change</font>

738
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,640
was successful like the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

739
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,679
you do a code review<font color="#E5E5E5"> aya looks good ship</font>

740
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,460
it but then it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> at production it</font>

741
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,510
breaks who knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of canary</font>

742
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,210
testing you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with</font>

743
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea of a canary in a coalmine you</font>

744
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,750
send a canary into the coal mine if the

745
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,130
canary dies we'll go go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coal</font>

746
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,920
mine because there's some kind of gas

747
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,620
down there if you always felt bad for

748
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,560
Canaries but you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same</font>

749
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,260
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> with testing right let me let</font>

750
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,929
me roll out a version that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

751
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,150
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and let me test it and I can</font>

752
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,950
run a series of tests of security tests

753
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,290
performance tests regression tests that

754
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,540
will tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me yeah it looks good or nope</font>

755
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,389
your bird<font color="#E5E5E5"> just died you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

756
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:55,430
the drawing board now you have those

757
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,500
results but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to be able to</font>

758
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,110
analyze them automatically so we built a

759
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,190
system that we call the automatic canary

760
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,060
analyzer not a not a real creative name

761
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,700
but what it does is for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

762
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,830
one it runs about over a thousand

763
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">different tests to compare your</font>

764
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,399
candidate against what's running in

765
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,990
production and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens is</font>

766
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,690
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular one this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our API</font>

767
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,490
team they made a code change that code

768
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,200
change resulted in a build that build

769
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,880
was automatically deployed on a canary

770
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,560
and since the production that received

771
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,330
some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small percentage of production</font>

772
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,070
traffic you'll see here at ran for about

773
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,750
11 hours we gathered all the metrics

774
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,490
over a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> different tests and</font>

775
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,800
metrics and then we have an automated

776
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,720
engine that gives you a best guess so

777
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,700
this one says 99 out of 100 looks pretty

778
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,500
good you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can omit</font>

779
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,210
this gives you a lot better about higher

780
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,490
insurance a lot higher confidence that

781
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,170
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work as expected if you</font>

782
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,790
have security tests you have performance

783
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:53,610
tests regression whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want next</font>

784
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,170
is a security monkey this is something

785
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've talked about before I actually</font>

786
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:01,340
talked about a little bit at aptech USA

787
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:04,980
last year if you're familiar with the

788
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,449
netflix is simian army they're done some

789
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,540
blog posts on it if you're interested in

790
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,430
there's some other talks what we do is

791
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,879
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this idea of a simian army that</font>

792
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,800
has automation and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

793
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,810
automation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conformity testing of</font>

794
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,300
architecture assessment of security

795
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,730
testing the if you were to think about

796
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,510
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old traditional way how do you</font>

797
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,730
validate that via that your applications

798
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,740
for example a che architecture is right

799
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,540
well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you schedule and you go talk</font>

800
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to some architecture review board your</font>

801
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,050
whiteboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they look at your plans</font>

802
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,260
and then you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well yeah it looks</font>

803
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:43,770
good go to production so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

804
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the opposite we we know how</font>

805
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:47,160
to be successful running in the cloud

806
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an H a perspective from a latency</font>

807
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,620
perspective so what we do is we say go

808
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,600
ahead you're smart deploy your code

809
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,969
deploy your system how you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then</font>

810
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to test it against our best</font>

811
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,420
practices and what we know work so one

812
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,270
of the things we have is chaos monkey

813
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:05,220
the idea with chaos monkey was what

814
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,540
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> que if a monkey was</font>

815
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,880
let loose in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data center just</font>

816
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,460
started pulling cables up could your app

817
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,140
withstand that what chaos monkey does it

818
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,060
just starts killing random instances can

819
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">your app survive random instances</font>

820
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,770
failing from the cluster if it can then

821
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,170
you know that's what we expect if not

822
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,670
then you again you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

823
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,740
work to do we have a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

824
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,200
monkeys we have a latency monkey which

825
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,960
will inject random Layton sees like how

826
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">does your app work if you know you if</font>

827
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,040
your if your dependencies you know take

828
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,810
five seconds to return well your code

829
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,010
handled that well you have a fallback or

830
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,899
will you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fail and security monkey</font>

831
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,900
what we use security monkey for is

832
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,450
primarily amazon security evaluation and

833
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:51,720
testing if you're familiar with with AWS

834
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,940
the configuration is kind of I kind of

835
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,640
think of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as stateless in that there's</font>

836
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,830
not really a way to track how a

837
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,190
particular configuration element has

838
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:04,230
changed over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example a storage</font>

839
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,690
bucket at s3 bucket which is a container

840
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to store files or a security group which</font>

841
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,430
is like a firewall you can that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

842
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">do call an API to say well tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

843
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,810
that looks like now but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

844
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,450
what it looked like an hour ago or last

845
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">year security monkey does that for us it</font>

846
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:23,880
continually poles and Czechs and will

847
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">also alert when things change it also</font>

848
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,880
has a rules engine that allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run</font>

849
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,380
configs thru rules to say hey this

850
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,880
config looks good or no<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some</font>

851
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems here and can alert us when we</font>

852
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,080
see those kinds of things this is just

853
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a drill in screen here of a</font>

854
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,939
security group in our test environment

855
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,439
you'll see here there's a configuration

856
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,210
history so if this config had been

857
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,650
changed over time you'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you'd</font>

858
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,210
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for each time the</font>

859
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,890
change was detected you can drill in to

860
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,380
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like at that time it's</font>

861
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:58,500
kind of like a time machine for your AWS

862
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,320
config sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple has that has that</font>

863
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,860
trademarked but and then over here is

864
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,770
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual the actual details of the of</font>

865
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,439
the config the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font>

866
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,360
talk about with automation so I talked

867
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,220
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about me mere around like</font>

868
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,560
software integrity in the whole NSA use

869
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,980
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> in I think we have good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visibility</font>

870
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,290
in terms of what's running in production

871
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,360
but we kind of wanted to take a belt and

872
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,010
suspenders approach so you know we trust

873
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,110
the build system we touch trust the

874
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,430
deployment system we also wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

875
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,030
the idea of like file integrity

876
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:35,340
monitoring so my next Archer

877
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:38,250
if you recognize this handsome<font color="#E5E5E5"> fellow</font>

878
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:41,000
this is Babu this is an ocelot from

879
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">Archer so we have a system called Babu</font>

880
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,900
that helped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> do file integrity</font>

881
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,790
monitoring one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

882
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:51,030
file integrity monitoring in the cloud

883
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">or environment easy and also difficult</font>

884
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,790
we we implement what has been since

885
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,990
named the immutable server pattern where

886
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,460
once we deploy a system we don't change

887
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,010
it we don't push code to it we don't

888
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,750
push patches to it well just rebate an

889
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,270
instance and launch it so you might

890
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">think well from a file integrity</font>

891
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,699
perspective us should be pretty easy

892
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because nothing ever changes and that is</font>

893
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,178
true<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw with the Canaries you</font>

894
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,730
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running multiple</font>

895
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,889
versions at the same time and if you're

896
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,199
familiar with file integrity monitoring

897
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,629
tools what you'll do is you'll take a

898
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:26,129
baseline of your gold image and then

899
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,150
you'll compare everything against that

900
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,850
well if you have all these different

901
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">versions that's going to fail so we</font>

902
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:34,500
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have systems that might have a</font>

903
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,389
staging cluster a test cluster multiple

904
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,489
canary clusters and you want to be able

905
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run file integrity across all those</font>

906
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:44,040
so that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babu does for us it helps</font>

907
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:46,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">us basically for any given app you can</font>

908
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,060
have multiple concurrent acceptable

909
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:53,399
baselines for file integrity monitoring

910
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,668
so just wrapping up again kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

911
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:59,089
to summarize my thesis is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think these</font>

912
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:02,160
these approaches these technologies are

913
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely transformative for security</font>

914
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,440
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also for our organizations and these</font>

915
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,500
kind of organizations your tent again

916
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,600
have a lot of speed a lot of scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

917
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,420
look at the culture visibility and

918
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,520
automation as a way of being security

919
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:23,400
enablers and staying safe in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font>

920
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:26,880
of environments you guys you guys seen

921
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,480
Derek also on netflix really really

922
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,180
funny it's not also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not appropriate for</font>

923
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,220
children but that's Ricky Gervais in the

924
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,640
middle anybody have any questions I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

925
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,640
answer yes

926
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,460
sure sure no that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question so</font>

927
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,589
the question is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> around you know</font>

928
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,900
how long does it take to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of I guess</font>

929
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:03,970
culturally embrace these kinds of things

930
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:08,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually get them implemented yeah</font>

931
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:10,189
triggers I think with with security so I

932
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:14,210
mean it actually started a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

933
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:16,250
later I started in I guess April of 2011

934
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,010
I was originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> hired as an individual</font>

935
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,840
contributor we have an information

936
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,940
security team that manages things like

937
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,350
employee technology and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of kind of</font>

938
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,080
corporate risk issues and deals with

939
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,110
vendors and they had been previously

940
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,450
managing product security basically what

941
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,580
like engineering leadership wanted was

942
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,189
more capability within the engineering

943
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,540
organization that because you know

944
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,860
operations and engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

945
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,810
are kind of different mindsets so they

946
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,340
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little more integrated so</font>

947
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:46,100
we started building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a team out I had I</font>

948
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,750
hired my first person about in June of

949
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,860
last year so we kind of went from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

950
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,960
person to now we're up to 10 but in

951
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of I things can happen really fast</font>

952
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,800
at Netflix which is why I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

953
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,450
there I mean there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

954
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,980
process it's that a freedom

955
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,370
responsibility if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good idea</font>

956
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can run with it again you have the</font>

957
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,230
idea of responsibility so it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

958
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful or you know it has that idea</font>

959
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,710
of fast failed to well we're perfectly

960
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:16,270
comfortable with trying new things out

961
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,270
if it doesn't work out then<font color="#CCCCCC"> just move on</font>

962
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,120
did I find<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome puke i did i did</font>

963
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:27,640
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten awesome security people to hire</font>

964
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,640
well nine so it's me at me plus 9

965
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,120
secondary secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jamar spirit versus</font>

966
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,350
people like those who are heavy security

967
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,029
well I would say it's a pretty good mix

968
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean if i look at like who I've hired</font>

969
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:44,030
a couple people came from consulting

970
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,620
security consulting we have a guy who we

971
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,170
came over<font color="#E5E5E5"> from zynga he was on their</font>

972
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:52,279
security team a guy who was at ebay on

973
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:54,400
their security team the guy from he

974
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,270
handled security for the Obama<font color="#CCCCCC"> campaign</font>

975
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,350
so it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a pretty</font>

976
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:01,640
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know different mix I mean I</font>

977
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimized kind of for that skills that I</font>

978
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,270
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that Venn diagram slide but</font>

979
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,580
you're really culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most</font>

980
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:11,030
important thing that's in our interview

981
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:13,759
process I'm less heavy on the technical

982
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,410
stuff and more about is this person are

983
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,640
they the right cultural fit are they

984
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:28,720
going to feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this kind</font>

985
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:31,400
of environment with agile so we didn't

986
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,379
we didn't feel the need to be like let's

987
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,060
all get<font color="#CCCCCC"> algae algae I'll training and</font>

988
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,580
really understand we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

989
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of for that visibility in terms of</font>

990
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:44,270
stand-ups we do we do a weekly meeting

991
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,770
that's either it's on Fridays it's

992
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:47,180
either in the middle of a sprint or at

993
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:51,050
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sprint so we either use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

994
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,609
just as a checkpoint or as like a like

995
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:56,570
let's close this print out let's start

996
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,890
the new one right bid sprint yeah one of

997
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things actually I could have covered</font>

998
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:02,629
culturally that has been pretty useful

999
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,310
you I mean it's everybody is you know

1000
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive to how they're laid out</font>

1001
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,420
physically at a when they're when you're

1002
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,520
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> work in terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your seating what we</font>

1003
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,950
did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we moved to like a shared space</font>

1004
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,600
model like a bull pen model where we're

1005
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,160
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting together that's actually</font>

1006
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,589
helped a lot because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team has grown</font>

1007
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,089
so fast you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of new people and</font>

1008
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,250
it's a pretty complex environment it's

1009
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,440
pretty hard to get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speed it's you</font>

1010
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,750
know very like the engineering tools

1011
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,250
involve the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems it's it's kind of a</font>

1012
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,600
lot to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1013
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,180
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1014
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">security people we have to know you not</font>

1015
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be an expert in everything we got to</font>

1016
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,170
know like the whole picture where as

1017
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,440
individual engineering teams just know

1018
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,440
their piece so it's helped a lot to look

1019
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:50,390
security is a very much operation

1020
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:54,349
football tomorrow but what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

1021
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:58,719
stage of my design architecture and lupe

1022
00:39:54,349 --> 00:39:58,719
many people who I wrote with this stage

1023
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,549
good question so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about</font>

1024
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,619
what do we do like for the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1025
00:40:07,549 --> 00:40:10,910
can't be automated designer view like

1026
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,410
you can't automate getting up at a

1027
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:15,489
whiteboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and chatting with a developer</font>

1028
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:18,019
on how they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to handle login or</font>

1029
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:23,929
so my team is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also responsible for that</font>

1030
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:25,848
and generally we have a i meanit's it's

1031
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:27,439
an optional model if somebody wants help

1032
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:28,959
with a design review or a threat model

1033
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:31,098
we're there to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> facilitate that</font>

1034
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:33,439
certainly with things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

1035
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:35,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of regulatory compliance like socks</font>

1036
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:38,808
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI we're going to be more aggressive</font>

1037
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:40,788
there but if you think culturally if if

1038
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:44,299
you're making a team responsible for the

1039
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:47,569
success of their app I think the mindset

1040
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:49,420
with us is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive app</font>

1041
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:51,589
you're handling sensitive data and

1042
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,299
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a security expert why</font>

1043
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,828
wouldn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to engage a security</font>

1044
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:56,299
team because ultimately you're

1045
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,609
responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security that data</font>

1046
00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:00,709
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with performance right if</font>

1047
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:02,538
you had a nap oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> geez I'm getting really</font>

1048
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,729
bad performance I don't have the you

1049
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:06,079
know the throughput I want or my cpu is

1050
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:07,910
spiked if you have a dedicated

1051
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,619
performance team that they're very

1052
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:11,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledgeable in that area why wouldn't</font>

1053
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:14,359
you engage them so a lot of our work is

1054
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,589
around that engagement model how do we

1055
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:16,999
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure people know how to get in</font>

1056
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:19,578
touch with us what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of services we</font>

1057
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:21,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">offer so we go out to a lot of team</font>

1058
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:23,569
meetings and talk about stuff we have a

1059
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:26,329
lot of those i mean i would say for us

1060
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:27,829
it's more informal like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we</font>

1061
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:30,529
don't we're not interested in producing

1062
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:32,029
a bunch of artifacts like<font color="#E5E5E5"> word documents</font>

1063
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,709
that talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this stuff we're</font>

1064
00:41:32,029 --> 00:41:35,719
interested in in making the improvements

1065
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:37,399
to code and anything that we feel like

1066
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:39,410
well hey that was a great solution that

1067
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,749
we worked on well let's productize that

1068
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,308
so we'll work on maybe integrating that

1069
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,740
into the platform so everybody gets to

1070
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:47,660
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

1071
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,100
so with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the automation the</font>

1072
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,520
developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> get feedback something's</font>

1073
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,950
wrong to fix it how do they is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any</font>

1074
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson learned or how other</font>

1075
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,950
people know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to make the same mistake</font>

1076
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,990
how do i do not think the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

1077
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,250
yeah that's that's a good one one of the

1078
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,200
good examples as I mentioned the

1079
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,240
responsible disclosure so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

1080
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,890
imagine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most common</font>

1081
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,779
bug we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cross-site scripting</font>

1082
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,750
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most common bug everybody</font>

1083
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,460
sees once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the metrics to kind of</font>

1084
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,760
prove that out that hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

1085
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,260
a lot of cross-site scripting we are

1086
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,869
working with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams to fix these</font>

1087
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,400
things but then we introduced like

1088
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:24,890
encoder libraries and sanitizer

1089
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,230
libraries that would just kind of take

1090
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,480
that problem away we did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> training</font>

1091
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,100
and some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy documentation and</font>

1092
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,220
tutorials and test cases on how to use

1093
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and then just engage from a</font>

1094
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,700
prioritized perspective like who are the

1095
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,860
teams that need this most the teams that

1096
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,000
have seen the bugs the edge services so

1097
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,369
that's kind of how we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

1098
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of issue but you can I think</font>

1099
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:48,369
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate that to other security</font>

1100
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,330
use cases like say key management or

1101
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:53,570
traffic management those kinds of things

1102
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:55,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generally we don't want to do a</font>

1103
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,170
ton of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the sake of it we</font>

1104
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,210
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay well these guys need</font>

1105
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,340
this help let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but from there</font>

1106
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,780
let's do a deep dive let's go do a talk

1107
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,250
to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineer group let's</font>

1108
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,780
make some wiki pages let's build some

1109
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,000
tools and use that as an opportunity

1110
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,290
because we we feel like that's proven

1111
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,200
the need for it now let's let's

1112
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:13,290
evangelize it like there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> one in the</font>

1113
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,379
back

1114
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">kion 30 insider that question directly</font>

1115
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:24,460
compete with Amazon Cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> renton</font>

1116
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:27,190
oh that's a good question so the

1117
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is really around competing with</font>

1118
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,790
it because I mean the thing about is

1119
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:35,380
with it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon they do have a video</font>

1120
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:38,140
service I mean in tech I mean

1121
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,510
competition is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cooperation they kind</font>

1122
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,299
of go hand in hand right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Google is</font>

1123
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,650
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone and you know there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1124
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,070
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of integration we actually</font>

1125
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,720
our CEO did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a did a keynote at the AWS</font>

1126
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:51,730
conference last year and they address

1127
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,040
that in terms of very early on in the

1128
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,240
relationship our CEOs talk to each other

1129
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,400
made sure that they were mutually

1130
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,839
comfortable with the arrangement and

1131
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,820
insert it's been a really good

1132
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,990
relationship in terms of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

1133
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,190
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we have we have some</font>

1134
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">other talks that go into some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1135
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,810
detail but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use public</font>

1136
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,369
cloud at the scale that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix needs to</font>

1137
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:13,779
use it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're really the</font>

1138
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:16,119
best out there so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned having</font>

1139
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,350
integrity checks over the software

1140
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,760
that's supposed to run your various

1141
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,560
versions how do you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

1142
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,060
everything gets on the system on the

1143
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,060
records if you do that 30

1144
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,790
so to do the integrity check how do you

1145
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,590
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything is there in terms</font>

1146
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:33,160
of the tool to do the integrity check or

1147
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:37,600
developer<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the strip you service push</font>

1148
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">it out there without oh yeah that's a</font>

1149
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question so like the idea of hey</font>

1150
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:43,480
Can somebody put some rogue thing out

1151
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:45,430
there that has bypassed something<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

1152
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,200
now could they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yes they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

1153
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,450
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put up a gate to say you can't</font>

1154
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,339
push out something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else but that's where</font>

1155
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,629
we would rely more on detection and

1156
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,060
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really nice things</font>

1157
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,710
about the cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> and AWS is that you</font>

1158
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,840
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have the idea of a</font>

1159
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,420
developer's got a server under their

1160
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,490
desk that's serving traffic because you

1161
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,890
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hide from an API right if I</font>

1162
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:07,240
say well show me all my servers because

1163
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,279
we were like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular use</font>

1164
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,569
case I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily do a query to say</font>

1165
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay show me everything that's out there</font>

1166
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,060
and show me that the base image that

1167
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> based off of is there's any</font>

1168
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,710
discrepancies that would be become

1169
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,049
immediately yep so I think we're all out

1170
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:21,550
of time I thank everybody for showing up

1171
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,840
you can catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> me later if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1172
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,840
questions I wasn't able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>
