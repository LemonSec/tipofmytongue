1
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">I am a developer so a lot of this is</font>

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,470
focused in that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm also</font>

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,288
security architect so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

4
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,570
like trying to use all that development

5
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,070
experience and marrying it with security

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,610
so so you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a lot of lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,030
references to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual settings or</font>

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,800
configuration things but we may not have

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,860
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into some of those so we can</font>

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover those later as well so at any time</font>

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,710
feel free to stop me we will just

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:58,589
encourages as an open discussion a

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:00,409
little bit about me so some security

14
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:03,269
architect for a company called pros

15
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,979
incorporated we are a software company

16
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:07,259
but we are a big data science company

17
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,170
essentially we develop pricing tools

18
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:15,590
placed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data so big it is part of</font>

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,590
what what what we do I'm not on Twitter

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,539
this is what came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think last year</font>

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,909
last last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year right a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

22
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago definitely not on facebook so i get</font>

23
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,560
emails from my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> sayings i have</font>

24
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:32,789
like 200 password reset emails and I'm

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,590
like thank you you know he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

26
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,899
validating my reason not to be on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,880
am a linkedin though I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> L in lingdon</font>

28
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,100
is equally then this in the same

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,469
category but that's a professional

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,839
compulsion so so what we'll cover is

31
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:52,919
what is big data how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are</font>

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with big data how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,420
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with Hadoop Cassandra it's</font>

34
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,439
a good good size so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can skip some of</font>

35
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,060
those the security concerns with with

36
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,279
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> buried big data and then this talks</font>

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,000
about generic concerns as well and then

38
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:11,160
i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> use Hadoop and Cassandra examples</font>

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,450
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to talk about some of the</font>

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,359
specific things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have problems</font>

41
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">with we look at some of the existing</font>

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,650
controls solutions depending on which

43
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,770
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> etalk some refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to is that</font>

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,140
controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> are solutions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for big data the</font>

45
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,290
security solutions why those solutions

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,929
are inadequate why in some cases they

47
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't apply or in some cases</font>

48
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,700
just is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just too hard basically or in</font>

49
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:40,890
fear not feasible and lastly we should

50
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,828
we will cover<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we should actually be</font>

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:49,760
be doing any questions so far so what is

52
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">big data for for some of you that didn't</font>

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,310
raise their hand so I like that there's

54
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:58,590
a there's a definition I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

55
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,709
cloud security alliance and some of the

56
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,620
other you know organizations have tried

57
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">to come up with but anything that</font>

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,459
crosses four or five sentences is very

59
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:11,909
hard to understand so I still think of

60
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,519
big data as volume velocity<font color="#CCCCCC"> in variety</font>

61
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,370
so three weeks very easy to understand

62
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,889
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to picture it and essentially</font>

63
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,680
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely is a big deal</font>

64
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:25,200
installation it may not have some of the

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,169
other characteristics like for example

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,379
the distributed nature of it for

67
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:34,919
instance SI p<font color="#E5E5E5"> hannah is that really big</font>

68
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:36,989
data or not so it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed</font>

69
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,299
it may be one monolithic server right so

70
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,760
so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so so that's why there</font>

71
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,269
are certain traits or characteristics of

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,888
big data but in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just think</font>

73
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:53,549
about big data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as volume velocity in</font>

74
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:56,129
variety so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do framework so this is</font>

75
00:03:53,549 --> 00:04:01,639
my own rendering of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hello based on what</font>

76
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:03,448
are very common components of flu

77
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cassandra there for people who are</font>

78
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,609
familiar with Cassandra you you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

79
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:12,689
replace some of the HDFS ones with just

80
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:15,870
Cassandra it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to configure it</font>

81
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,728
will completely replace it but in

82
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">general you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a distributed file</font>

83
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,258
system right you you build computation

84
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,409
capacity on it so you have MapReduce and

85
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:28,139
then you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dataflow language and</font>

86
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:31,139
essentially sequel access to it so very

87
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,330
very very modular structure it's the

88
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,080
most popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> synonymous</font>

89
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,330
with big data a few capabilities you're

90
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,419
all familiar MapReduce distributed

91
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,419
storage

92
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,720
so again this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you all</font>

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,310
might be aware of but I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring it out to put some context around</font>

95
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,660
the things that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font>

96
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,099
you have you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> data nodes and</font>

97
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,720
essentially your MapReduce jobs run

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,820
close to those data not so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> task</font>

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,740
trackers and tasks that actually run

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,840
close to your data nodes so data nodes

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,199
have the actual data so any and your

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,750
computing is running close to that data

103
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,060
name node has the metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the entire</font>

104
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,430
file structure so it basically knows

105
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,210
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where piece of data actually</font>

106
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,290
resides and can respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to queries and</font>

107
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">inclined you have clients interacting</font>

108
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:30,360
with these so it's pretty short

109
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:35,479
introduction to the HDFS one so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to introduce no sequel</font>

111
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,320
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with no</font>

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,450
sequel it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same crowd as</font>

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,760
Hadoop and Sandra so again it's

114
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,039
basically not only sequel you have we

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,830
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cassandra and MongoDB as two</font>

116
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,469
examples of no sequel stores it's not

117
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,630
your typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> are DBMS Cassandra for</font>

118
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,020
example requires a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

119
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:04,169
mindset to essentially manage to

120
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,889
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> create what we call schema</font>

121
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,810
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly schema but to manage</font>

122
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage the column families and</font>

123
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,500
deal with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a daily basis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

124
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,550
understand some of the key things that

125
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,370
Cassandra<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks so a lot of folks use</font>

126
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,960
it apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the big data needs a lot</font>

127
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks use it because it's highly</font>

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,750
available partition tolerant you can you

129
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,380
can define strategies for your key

130
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,560
spaces and separate them out for tenant

131
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,419
or customer or however you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

132
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,810
MongoDB be we do use MongoDB as well

133
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:45,659
it's not as high as Cassandra so so our

134
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,260
favorite question I mean is is big data

135
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,360
secure so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think as most of us you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

136
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,530
and especially security folks that work

137
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,530
with big data or use big data

138
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,320
to me it's obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it is an</font>

139
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,750
afterthought right they probably

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,700
concentrated on performance availability

141
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,160
scalability and then those were much

142
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,490
more important in terms of what big data

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,140
was meant to do so security was what was

144
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,600
pretty much an afterthought or an

145
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:16,380
evening this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignored in up to its</font>

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,470
initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> stages but the focus is shifting</font>

147
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,370
now with Hadoop is gaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

148
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,920

149
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">some references to service that</font>

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,290
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the percentage of</font>

151
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,489
use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop as but I think in one of</font>

152
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the servers it was like sixty-two</font>

153
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,970

154
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:39,780
in some way or the other so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's gaining</font>

155
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's gaining in popularity so security</font>

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,409
is not being ignored now so you'll find

157
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of discussions around Hadoop</font>

158
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,310
security big data security in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,340
some of the other issues around

160
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cassandra for example and these open</font>

161
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,140
source projects are responding in kind

162
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,640
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three problem areas and the</font>

163
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,590
nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big data itself the deployment</font>

164
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,360
of big data the<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise adoption of</font>

165
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,359
big data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we cover some of those</font>

166
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:13,620
so the not so secure nature of big data

167
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:18,000
basically boils down to issues with

168
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,670
ownership privacy integrity it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,390
hard to identify sensitive data in some

170
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:26,760
cases because data can data is you know

171
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:29,159
has variety right so it dynamically you

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,110
can start adding new new columns new

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,690
attributes to your column family it's

174
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard to define that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in a</font>

175
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,720
typical I do a mess but you have to

176
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,400
define the schema and say this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

177
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be accepting this is what I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

178
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,770
accepting and this is my general schema

179
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,060
so again that makes it harder to

180
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,380
identify sensitive data there is no

181
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,150
password field it could be called

182
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,870
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in many different</font>

183
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">forms then liability and litigation</font>

184
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,610
associated with who owns data once you

185
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,410
transform analyze and present results

186
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,820
who owns<font color="#E5E5E5"> that result now because it</font>

187
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,089
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it could be combined from two</font>

188
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,340
different sources it's prone to insider

189
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,140
attacks especially analytics for

190
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">companies that deal with big data</font>

191
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,230
analytics

192
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:13,799
it's a big problem essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

193
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,529
have raw data and after you know running

194
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:18,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">your competition on it it could now be</font>

195
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:20,970
start to become meaningful where you can

196
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:22,498
make inferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> about customer behavior</font>

197
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,239
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make inferences about pricing</font>

198
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:29,429
you can make lots of judgments right so

199
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:31,589
those are prone to insider attacks

200
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:35,699
because now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look at</font>

201
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:37,730
some of these things so the there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

202
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:42,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">provenance issues which basically just</font>

203
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,709
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how did its data originate</font>

204
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,549
who originated it who is the rightful

00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,748
owner for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular data so and in</font>

206
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:52,709
general traditional controls are

207
00:09:48,749 --> 00:09:54,119
ineffective so like you might know right

208
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,399
i mean just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about traditional</font>

209
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:58,679
security controls so traditional

210
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,569
controls now now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file system can</font>

211
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:03,660
control needs authentication to

212
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:05,639
basically first figure out that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

213
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,358
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right accessing that</font>

214
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:11,519
particular data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data</font>

215
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:14,879
installations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hdfs</font>

216
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,189
could be used by<font color="#CCCCCC"> cassandra let's say</font>

217
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,829
cassandra has some data and what it is

218
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:22,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing is using HDFS as just one other</font>

219
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:24,899
store to store metadata but<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassandra is</font>

220
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,459
the one with the actual data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

221
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,779
now you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassandra notes</font>

222
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,029
distributed across this how do you

223
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure those then you might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

224
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,059
tasks running on the same machines as d

225
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:38,249
HDFS data nodes how do you secure those

226
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:41,009
so what happens is traditional controls

227
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:44,939
start to become ineffective and in a lot

228
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:46,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cases you need what the industry</font>

229
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,419
calls forward-looking security which

230
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,509
means trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict what this model</font>

231
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:56,399
will become after analysis and after

232
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:58,379
computation right so again as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

233
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,610
shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> links could be tampered if you</font>

234
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:03,209
have a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal installation around</font>

235
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,249
collecting you know device data or data

236
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,988
from from your sensors you could

237
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,779
essentially compromise that device

238
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:11,519
itself again raises provenance issues if

239
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:14,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using that as part of my analytics</font>

240
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,779
is that data realistic reliable can i

241
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">really trust that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm measuring</font>

242
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:21,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether data are those sensors will</font>

243
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,480
really reliable and a lot of cases

244
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,649
these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not have that security</font>

245
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,929
building because again it was not

246
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:35,839
designed with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security things in</font>

247
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:38,329
mind so deployment security issues again

248
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,179
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not Hadoop specific it could</font>

249
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,689
relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other ones but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

250
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:47,660
good example for it for instance so we

251
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:51,469
have a large attack surface right you

252
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,079
have data nodes you have name node a

253
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,059
secondary name node you have job tracker

254
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">as your task trackers you have tasks</font>

255
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:03,919
actually running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have other</font>

256
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">additional services that want to connect</font>

257
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,559
to these<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large attack surface and it</font>

258
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,378
could range from a two node cluster to a

259
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,230
thousand or are in some cases of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000</font>

260
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:16,970
node cluster so very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large attack</font>

261
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,470
surface and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to security</font>

262
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,809
professionals in general you know

263
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,929
signifies trouble services could be

264
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:26,269
impersonated you could have robe nodes

265
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:28,689
it's not too hard to become a service

266
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:31,189
essentially if you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

267
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:34,248
credentials or if you know something so

268
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:36,709
we see some examples of those it's very

269
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:40,809
difficult to determine data loss so if

270
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:43,819
you talk to compliance or audit you know

271
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,589
people and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave Hanson in his</font>

272
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:49,549
keynote refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read compliance is not</font>

273
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:52,220
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they would say oh I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

274
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:54,199
data loss prevention tool like DLP tool

275
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,029
how do you put that here how do you

276
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,639
really determine if data was lost or not

277
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,949
lost let's say somebody just captured

278
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,499
data from one node the cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

279
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">computed itself it is it is it is highly</font>

280
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:07,639
available and tolerant right so it would

281
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:09,589
recompute itself and still give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you back</font>

282
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,059
your data it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to determine</font>

283
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:15,319
data loss and again as we saw it has a

284
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,669
non-traditional security needs there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

285
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:19,160
no choke point there is no single choke

286
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:22,100
point that that you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we put</font>

287
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,769
a firewall here and stop everything it's

288
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,119
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to do it's possible it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

289
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,649
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to do and even if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you</font>

290
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,939
do it in some way or the other you

291
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,050
essentially run into security

292
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:36,290
scalability concerns

293
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,089
will my solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scale will this</font>

294
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:45,140
security solution be able to meet the

295
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:46,490
demands of big data itself so as we are

296
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,040
doing this which not forget that big

297
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,630
data was the main reason was for for

298
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,790
massive storage and massive computation

299
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,029
so anything that stops us from doing

300
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:05,420
that is not a viable<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution so any</font>

301
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:07,100
questions here so again this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

302
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,120
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking on her do but just using</font>

303
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:16,220
that as an example we so again not

304
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,630
designed with security in mind so I'm

305
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,300
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> questioning again why we need</font>

306
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,490
multiple communication protocols why we

307
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,189
need multiple authentication mechanisms

308
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,800
it could be how performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> might might</font>

309
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,250
have been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason right where which</font>

310
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,199
dictates which ones you actually end up

311
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,260
using but still I mean as we as we

312
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,220
design systems and security professions

313
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,470
the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to our mind</font>

314
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:45,290
is simplicity right trying to a complex

315
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">system is not secure cannot be secure</font>

316
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,680
because there is some part that somebody

317
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:52,540
doesn't understand and that's where you

318
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">have opportunities for four attacks</font>

319
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,140
multiple endpoints you have API is you

320
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,540
have notes the notes physical nodes

321
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,170
themselves in most cases they are just

322
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,730
commodity servers or if you're leasing

323
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,469
these servers and they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

324
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,020
hardened<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run into all issues</font>

325
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,420
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional security</font>

326
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,730
around a physical box you have web apps

327
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,370
and you have web app security issues

328
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:20,270
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 type of issues</font>

329
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,579
in those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems start</font>

330
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,069
to tend to biggest problems tend to be

331
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:30,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of no security default</font>

332
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:32,720
is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> security so if you have if you</font>

333
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:34,579
ever brought up your Hadoop cluster like

334
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,690
some of you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this on your</font>

335
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:40,399
own right I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up the</font>

336
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:43,880
entire loop cluster what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it's</font>

337
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,890
no security so just imagine not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

338
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,480
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us are admins when we have</font>

339
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,339
development

340
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,920
ground in some cases we even understand

341
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:54,430
scripting we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand the network</font>

342
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,310
protocols I love side of security but

343
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">still it's we are not Edmunds so when</font>

344
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,849
you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a system with no security</font>

345
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:06,100
it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult task to go and</font>

346
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,260
configure this so for example job job

347
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">tricolor name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> node task tracker they're</font>

348
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,959
all accessible they're all ports are

349
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:16,029
accessible user identity can be easily

350
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,750
spooked I think I have an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

351
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:22,230
that somewhere later permissions can be

352
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,060
circumvented and and simply because

353
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no authentication so if there is</font>

354
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,768
no authentication how will you authorize

355
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:32,709
somebody right so if you are saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

356
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:35,260
only super user can modify this

357
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:37,479
particular file but I can become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

358
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,130
superuser right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because there is</font>

359
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,459
you're not authenticating super users in

360
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:45,850
it so it does have<font color="#CCCCCC"> permissions based on</font>

361
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:48,399
file permissions so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HDFS model</font>

362
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,459
itself on file permissions<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to</font>

363
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,410
enforce authorization but again it's

364
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:56,199
ineffective because authentication was

365
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,120
not not there by default again rogue

366
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,920
services you can you can have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of</font>

367
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,350
code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Java code that comes</font>

368
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,949
up and says i am the task tracker or md

369
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:11,250
job tracker and again as i refer data

370
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,250
can be accessed modified which basically

371
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:15,250
also means that you can accidentally

372
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:19,260
delete it so even though there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

373
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:22,480
malicious intent a user can go in and

374
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:26,939
accidentally caused or format the entire

375
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,939
name node we lose all or all of the data

376
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,570
and in interesting thing is again I

377
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,300
think Dave Dave Hanson refer to this in

378
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,570
his keynote right security is not

379
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,340
optional that's that's the message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

380
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:48,169
I think security professionals get it

381
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,050
different shades of it but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all get it</font>

382
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:53,180
that it is not optional so why have a

383
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:57,909
system which doesn't have any security

384
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:00,500
by default and maybe performance

385
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">availability right those those things</font>

386
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,650
are very much more important but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

387
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:11,120
still why I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> as this is very hard</font>

388
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:14,750
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to understand so few examples of</font>

389
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,489
no security just pass the user name in

390
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,450
the URL for like a job tracker and it

391
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,810
will know that's what you are HTTP

392
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,400
authentication allows anonymous access

393
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,720
user impersonation is not too hard if

394
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,540
you have a client machine with access to

395
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,800
the cluster you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can become as long as</font>

396
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,950
you have root access on your own my

397
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,960
client machine which most people do you

398
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,940
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> become any user and then you can</font>

399
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,210
delete everything by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> right i</font>

400
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,260
mean that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> be false security and</font>

401
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:47,770
maybe that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know security is</font>

402
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:51,220
called simple security so it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

403
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,220
euphemism right

404
00:18:51,590 --> 00:19:02,360
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have security it's simple secure</font>

405
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:04,100
so authorization again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will hear</font>

406
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,110
this theme like by default by lee for a

407
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot so by default permissions are not</font>

408
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,668
checked service level authorization is

409
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,909
disabled is here akasa la permission

410
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:16,700
permit all access to services<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethel</font>

411
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:21,289
solid protocol level there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 also</font>

412
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">right protocols or maybe less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles</font>

413
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:25,309
allow permit all access to job

414
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,559
operations so basically if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am a job</font>

415
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,539
and you have multiple jobs running from

416
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:31,220
for multiple users<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go in and start</font>

417
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,690
deleting<font color="#CCCCCC"> others jobs and changing the</font>

418
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,279
priority of those jobs are the positive

419
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,990
point is that groups for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles can be</font>

420
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,200
retrieved from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ldap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we supported</font>

421
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,419
that so essentially you could say that

422
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,700
user foo can only do this if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's part</font>

423
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,590
of admin group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put that in in</font>

424
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard ldap and manage it through</font>

425
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,158
that so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but again because</font>

426
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:58,669
there's no authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could become</font>

427
00:19:52,159 --> 00:20:05,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> user so how many of you are</font>

428
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:10,850
familiar with kerberos<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think for</font>

429
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,789
me so Kerberos saves the day right so

430
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,178
they added Kerberos support that

431
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:18,830
provides authentication for Hadoop and

432
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,090
awesome because now you can enforce

433
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,010
authorization<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you have</font>

434
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication now so you can reliably</font>

435
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,090
know that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> user says I'm super user</font>

436
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,520
then the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> was authenticated using a</font>

437
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,720
Kerberos ticket so that must be the

438
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,629
right user I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> curb processor is a very</font>

439
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,640
good protocol so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> offers mutual</font>

440
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,010
authentication for users and services

441
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,789
and services and services right so

442
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,110
things became much more simpler and as I

443
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:52,070
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorization can now be</font>

444
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:56,779
meaningfully enforced so for encryption

445
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,939
it used users hassle<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple</font>

446
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication security layer something</font>

447
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,310
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can</font>

448
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:09,220
plug in other authentication mechanisms

449
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it so it uses Kerberos as the prime 1</font>

450
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,480
and Q of P is quality of protection so

451
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,969
it now you can say okay my connection

452
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,160
that that I used from my client to the

453
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,600
name node can be encrypted using quality

454
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,100
of protection of confidential which is

455
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:27,679
which means encrypted the data transfer

456
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,750
can also be configured for encryption so

457
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,240
now the data transferred how you access

458
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,510
data how you get the data back can also

459
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,960
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption you can</font>

460
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:41,660
enable ssl for for web traffic and web

461
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,490

462
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,430
supports a cell with tomcat config so

463
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,660
thick things started to get better right

464
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:53,890
I mean you can you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> add like</font>

465
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,000
Hadoop dot RB<font color="#CCCCCC"> C dot protection equals</font>

467
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,220
configure start to configure sasal and

468
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,050
now since we have very short time so i

469
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,400
will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some example so in case you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of the details</font>

472
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:13,520
configure that particular instance and

473
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:19,389
yeah there is Hadoop<font color="#CCCCCC"> God ssl dot enabled</font>

474
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,639
equals to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 that enables</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL is there so</font>

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,920
does I mean how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the day or does</font>

476
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,400
it right now trying to find Hadoop

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,120
Kerberos admins because they use similar

technologies so so you you can take help

483
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,780

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">very difficult and as developers if we</font>

tough will<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises allow Hadoop</font>

491
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,689
Kerberos in most cases the moment we

492
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:12,530
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting up a different</font>

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,899
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,000 service principles because we</font>

synchronize them across all of this

machine's I mean I teachers probably

says<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no no this is we don't want that</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as preconditions so it says no</font>

507

root access to the cluster or job

508
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,270
launcher machines which is fair because

509
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:56,750
you can access the key tabs and you can

510
00:23:53,270 --> 00:24:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">access additional things right and no</font>

511
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,650
communication over untrusted networks so

512
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:07,790
which again implies that it's a trusted

513
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:09,500
network if it's a trusted network then

514
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,649
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other mechanisms that are</font>

515
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:19,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible right so can somebody give me</font>

516
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:23,030
example of a trusted network so VPN

517
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,250
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are using VPN to connect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

518
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so now if I have VPN I can use</font>

519
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:34,580
other mechanisms do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditionally need</font>

520
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,070
SSL in that case or enabling security

521
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,409
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes so so to me it's like</font>

522
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,710
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing to have</font>

523
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,150
Kerberos practically if you try

524
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,550
implementing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dieta set up user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

seperate<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers that server that</font>

526
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:52,220
can basically understand these nodes and

527
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,980
physical nodes only then Kerberos is

528
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,510
really effective it is cumbersome and

529
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,190
then you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to create the</font>

530
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,460
service principles in the right way that

531
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:06,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hadoop can start using so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

535
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,100
Kerberos you have symmetric keys between

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,869
is used to encrypt the communication

between the client and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data nodes</font>

556
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,908
right but then it could escalate<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if</font>

key that is used that it uses to talk to

559
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,539
the name node so now you you can

560
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:12,919
intercept that communication as well so

561
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:17,989
it's very hard HTTP span go has to be

562
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned on in browsers and I looked at I</font>

563
00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:22,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet Explorer had the best</font>

564
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,850
support probably i looked at chrome and

565
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,739
firefox and required settings to make it

566
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,600
enable and that's how you can talk to

567
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:34,129
your web consoles that that are using

especially security for professionals

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:55,309
now because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand it I</font>

don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what else I would be</font>

go<font color="#E5E5E5"> would is there only for internet zone</font>

579
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,960
with this spin go we only turned on for

580
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,720
intranet zone which means server a and

581
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,820
server be it will start to send my car

582
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,049
brass ticket what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I create another</font>

583
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">one right spoof the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domain will it send</font>

584
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,539
my Kerberos ticket to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that server as</font>

585
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">well so again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that requires us</font>

586
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,440
to turn on anything is a turnoff right

587
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:25,759
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stops me right there and I'll</font>

588
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,950
start thinking about alternatives what

589
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,549
what else how else can I talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those</font>

590
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,230
web servers the uzi uses a super user

591
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:36,619
which has access to the entire Hadoop

592
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:44,019
stack and authorization for that is

593
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:44,019
disabled by default so very very open

594
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,530
so as noted earlier to enforce

595
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,740
authorization it must be explicitly

596
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,450
enabled if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> create those users on all</font>

597
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,540
the relevant machines where you can

598
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,020
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using file permissions to file</font>

599
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:04,360
like permissions to enforce<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security</font>

600
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:06,570
all of these Kerberos credentials have

601
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be mapped to operating system users</font>

602
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,189
and in some cases it's not too hard we

603
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">just take like Kerberos way where there</font>

604
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:17,590
is a principal<font color="#E5E5E5"> name /the actual hostname</font>

605
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:19,150
and then add the domain so you can just

606
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">strip off and take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first part</font>

607
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,560
principal<font color="#E5E5E5"> name as user ID and create a</font>

608
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,990
user in your operating system so it's

609
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">not too hard but something again it's</font>

610
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:32,920
like an admin that that does it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

611
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:40,420
skated for each protocol possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

612
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:49,150
different protocols the so yeah any

613
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:54,040
questions here so again this sorry just

614
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:56,950
wrong key so no encryption at rest so it

615
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,840
provides in conclusion over the wire

616
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,640
gives us authentication but there's no

617
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,939
encryption address so i cannot encrypt

618
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,490
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> HDFS file store using a Kerberos like</font>

619
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:09,430
mechanism for example so by again by

620
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,870
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> kerberos RPC communication is</font>

621
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,120
unencrypted client today denotes

622
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,209
connections are<font color="#E5E5E5"> an encrypted HTTP</font>

623
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,370
communication is unencrypted so the

624
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,020
default thing is what starts getting to

625
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,389
us off after a while because you have to

626
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,000
force yourself to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the entire</font>

627
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,760
installation and start enabling one

628
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,600
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> after another to ensure a fully</font>

629
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,180
secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hadoop cluster and one more thing</font>

630
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,159
key exchanges happen using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC so our</font>

631
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">PC must be encrypted so the Kerberos our</font>

632
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,910
basic communication even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's</font>

633
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,459
disabled by default must be encrypted

634
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:46,180
because that's how i duped sends out the

635
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:50,230
symmetric keys to and changes them every

636
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,030
10<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 24 hours I think and it allows the</font>

637
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,800
data nodes to communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

638
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,360
node using those symmetric keys

639
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,580
that those TX changes happen using our

640
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">PC and they're all symmetric keys so</font>

641
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,820
that communication must be encrypted so

642
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,980
even if you encrypt everything else in a

643
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:10,550
forgot to do this still vulnerable so

644
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:14,330
Cassandra so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go too far into it</font>

645
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you can just use the same arguments</font>

646
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,050
we had against a dupe for Cassandra this

647
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,720
again by default no other indication

648
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:24,139
authorization of confidentiality privacy

649
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,340
or integrity if you are familiar with

650
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:31,010
with with Cassandra it's just multiple

651
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,840
nodes essentially they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> also equal</font>

652
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,440
there is no master there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no fixed</font>

653
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,389
master so they all talk to each other

654
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,320
they keep each other in sync so it's a

655
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:45,260
it's a very fault tolerant system that

656
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,909
guarantees availability at all times so

657
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,220
once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a server and if you use</font>

658
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">nmap or any one of those or poor</font>

659
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,900
scanners you can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some of these</font>

660
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,780
servers and ports and usually 9 160 is

661
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,860
what it uses and if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

662
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,000
authentication of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> physician by</font>

663
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,030
default you can just connect to it and

664
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,030
start listing out information it's just

665
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,889
like sequel injection vulnerability

666
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:12,170
except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no authentication so</font>

667
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:13,700
you can start listing out everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

668
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a topic has been covered in</font>

669
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:21,140
some talks including I think one in last

670
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,070
year where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot the name the</font>

671
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,210
gentleman that talked about no sequel

672
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:29,510
vulnerabilities so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been dealt</font>

673
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,100
with in some detail I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into</font>

674
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,780
detail aspects of this but basically

675
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,810
it's like injection attacks all over

676
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:38,810
again so cql is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cassandra query language</font>

677
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:40,879
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start it suffers from modeled on</font>

678
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,750
sequel so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> suffer from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

679
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,290
problems I am mdx is multi-dimensional

680
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:50,360
one so it used for overlap and so you

681
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,180
can again start using injections in

682
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,709
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript injections where the</font>

683
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">server-side suppose JavaScript you can</font>

684
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,900
start injecting JavaScript into that for

685
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">example a star and comment out the rest</font>

686
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:08,390
of the so traditional sequel injection

687
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:11,399
just in a new avatar for 40

688
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,870
then again we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the duplications</font>

689
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,850
of sensitive data might be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple</font>

690
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,500
places to be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fault-tolerant it</font>

691
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,500
just keeps data in multiple places

692
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,480
spread around geographically and new

693
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:27,230
attributes again can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be added to column</font>

694
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,070
families as we have seen so so for today

695
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,210
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if you review the entire</font>

696
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:34,409
schema so-called schema and we find that

697
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,640
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no more sensitive fields</font>

698
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:43,110
tomorrow I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply add one</font>

699
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:44,460
without anybody's approval so that's the

700
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,399
question we are asking in this

701
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:53,790
presentation should we add OB<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

702
00:32:47,400 --> 00:33:01,320
vulnerability what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think yes</font>

703
00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:07,950
no yes sort of yes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we know</font>

704
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:10,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to commit I'll say yes so some of</font>

705
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:12,840
the practical steps so coming to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

706
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,080
last 15 minutes we'll just talk about

707
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the practical steps for example</font>

708
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,600
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do what we ended up doing is</font>

709
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,429
right write our own authentication and

710
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:29,159
authorization plugin so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

711
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:31,800
example of how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write something</font>

712
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,870
simple so we just created our own and

713
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,970
you just configure it in Cassandra zamel

714
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:40,428
file clear your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own authentic ater and</font>

715
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:43,110
your author and the authorizer basically

716
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:44,970
the good thing with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can tie</font>

717
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,500
this to your traditional authentication

718
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,090
mechanism you can try this your active

719
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,179
directory you can try this to your LDAP

720
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,740
and you can allow users to be

721
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:55,620
authenticated in the traditional way

722
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,110
that they expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we authenticate</font>

723
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,580
it or you can add a token<font color="#CCCCCC"> based orth</font>

724
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,830
mechanism and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our case we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

725
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,899
an OAuth mechanism you can add a token

726
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,520
based authentication as well where it

727
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,440
can go and talk to an oval server and

728
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,960
authorize that particular request

729
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,070
without compromising credentials so

730
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,859
that's a that's a good thing as well so

731
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,330
authorization granularity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

732
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,270
only supports the key space and the

733
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,739
column family one

734
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,699
that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> support cell level access</font>

735
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:26,739
we cannot say field password or field

736
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,569
SSN is only accessible to this user but

737
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,279
it does support at the key space which

738
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:33,970
is you can just think about it like a

739
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:38,740
tablespace 1 and column family which is

740
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:41,080
actually a like a table so it allows in

741
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,549
our case for example it allows access up

742
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,009
to those<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can say only admin</font>

743
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,480
has access to this key space and these

744
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,830
users have access to these column

745
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,190
families so now at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I can step</font>

746
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:54,509
separate out those users it's not too

747
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:57,670
hard it's Java so again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font>

748
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:00,040
take examples and<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

749
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,260
of the best ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> now starting one or two</font>

750
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,820
recent the recent versions the support

751
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,000
internal authentication so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

752
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:10,810
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be used where you can</font>

753
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,490
create used use kassandra's facilities

754
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,580
to create a user in Cassandra and then

755
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,620
authenticated with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> user but yeah I</font>

756
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,569
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only problem is that then it's</font>

757
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,150
just internal to that can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can tie</font>

758
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to your organization one so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I still</font>

759
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:28,270
prefer the authentication and

760
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,880
authorization plugin we must enable node

761
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:34,480
to node encryption so again it just uses

762
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,910
pki to encrypt the communication between

763
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,380
nodes so you can enable node to node

764
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:42,490
encryption between different<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cassandra</font>

765
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:46,270
nodes client to node encryption again is

766
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSL so you can just configure a key</font>

767
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,720
storage our key<font color="#CCCCCC"> store on your server</font>

768
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,980
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> i configure a trust or on the</font>

769
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,470
client side and encrypt that

770
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:58,140
communication so with with some of these

771
00:35:53,470 --> 00:36:00,609
things it makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cassandra installation</font>

772
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:03,190
practical secure in practical terms it's

773
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:05,710
not still not ideal but it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

774
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,710
get rid of the common attacks against

775
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sun for example you can't connect to</font>

776
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,550
it using you know the cassandra command

777
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:15,940
line client and get data because it will

778
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,930
ask you for authentication the last one

779
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">is sure depends on your threat model so</font>

780
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should do threat modeling in general</font>

781
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,830
but in this particular case if it's if

782
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,830
it's like within within a V net or VPN

783
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:32,140
type of environment then you can skip

784
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:35,020
this and just you

785
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,279
traditional controls there are other

786
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,320
mechanisms where you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use field-level</font>

787
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,630
encryptions I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

788
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,940
those as well but you can enable disk

789
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,550
support for for encryption if if the

790
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:48,070
cluster is open then this is something

791
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:51,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be it becomes a mastiff</font>

792
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:57,790
depending on your threat model any

793
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:59,560
questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Sun so let's talk</font>

794
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the enterprise adoption of</font>

795
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,330
Hadoop so enterprise adoption is picking

796
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,270
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that some of the survey I</font>

797
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:09,160
looked at if you do person are using

798
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,080
fifty to sixty percent are using handle

799
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,910
pin in<font color="#E5E5E5"> prod our test environments that</font>

800
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:17,620
that numbers these numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> growing</font>

801
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:20,170
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases is just a matter of</font>

802
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprises to adopt a big lead</font>

803
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:28,500
installation like I do so enterprises

804
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:32,200
are adopting this it is picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a few</font>

805
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">insensitive so no encryption for data</font>

806
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">addressed right and we will talk about</font>

807
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,189
practical mechanisms for this no

808
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,259
security by default and hard to

809
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,420
configure right how to configure the

810
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,310
available security no multi-factor

811
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,220
authentication no strong or adaptive

812
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:50,860
authentication kerberos authentication

813
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,259
is yet another scheme for enterprises

814
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,380
variant which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what one had been</font>

815
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,680
dedicated to this you know versus just

816
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">tying in with the existing mechanism</font>

817
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,339
there is no attribute or policy based

818
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,790
authorization so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot</font>

819
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,890
say that user Bob can only access the

820
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,980
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analytic systems from 9am to</font>

821
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:15,580
5pm that that's that's his allowed

822
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,870
access limit so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't do that</font>

823
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't even do it based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attributes</font>

824
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">we cannot say that SSN is on not visible</font>

825
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,910
to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks on even the last four</font>

826
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:27,310
digits are not visible unless you get

827
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,620
your manager to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand over your</font>

828
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:33,460
shoulder or something so that's not

829
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:39,310
there for for enterprises and so

830
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:40,270
differential privacy issues I can are

831
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:45,339
you guys familiar with differential

832
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:48,719
privacy for big data anyone

833
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:52,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically differential privacy</font>

834
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:55,599
is a term that that refers to you know

835
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:59,229
combining<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets let us say so</font>

836
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,440
individual pieces of data do not hold

837
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:04,569
any personal personally identifiable

838
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,670
information right PII let's say so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

839
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:09,729
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one set of anonymized data</font>

840
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:11,469
another set of anonymized data so both

841
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:13,149
are benign which means i can release

842
00:39:11,469 --> 00:39:15,219
this for research purposes or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

843
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,249
release<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for some other need academic</font>

844
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:20,559
needs without affecting any security or

845
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:23,049
identifying any individuals but when

846
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,029
these two pieces are combined that

847
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:26,229
reveals insights and information that

848
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:32,950
allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to now start identifying</font>

849
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:35,049
people so the the case i read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

850
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:39,848
I think issues with this was was Netflix

851
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:42,390
where I think they probably had some

852
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:46,589
issues associated with differential

853
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,538
privacy they released anonymized data

854
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:52,078
with IMDb one that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

855
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:54,390
identify you know individuals taste in

856
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,819
movies and you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to narrow down</font>

857
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,348
their orientation or other details I 12

858
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:03,609
movie preferences tell a lot about

859
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:05,200
ourselves and in some cases so so

860
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:08,170
differential privacy again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

861
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">well the other case was AOL where they</font>

862
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:12,369
release anonymized data which was used

863
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:16,538
with just standard phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> book data to</font>

864
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:18,910
identify users so again it was a big

865
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,289
issue sure thing is some key folks they

866
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,920
lost their jobs because it was that

867
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:25,509
serious so differential privacy is what

868
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,190
scares I mean that the litigation and

869
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,809
the liability is what scares enterprises

870
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,880
where they say oh wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute let let</font>

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,280
there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we don't</font>

this suffers<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall adoption</font>

893
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:31,979
vulnerability and patch management is

894
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:35,890
again one area where<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical IT</font>

895
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,210
basically looks for answers say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

896
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">have these clusters what if this is</font>

898
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,480
and patch that and if you have like a

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:53,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">four thousand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> node cluster it's very</font>

900
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:55,359
hard to go and manage these so project

901
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,190
rhino is something that will accelerate

902
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hadoop adoption by supporting some of</font>

905
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,390
promise it allows a token based

906
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:10,480
authentication which is what I think

907
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:12,250
most of us are moving towards that allow

908
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,829
that freezes from traditional user

909
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:18,190
password mechanisms after a while and

910
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:20,890
you just send the token limited limited

911
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:23,500
capabilities expires quickly you can

912
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,210
send these tokens out and project<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhino</font>

913
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,270
promises to support some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

914
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:34,300

at rest and in transit this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

916
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,869
support for cell level authorization in

919
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:51,339
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a this will be a significant</font>

920
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:53,740
step forward but since<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some time</font>

away one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other practical steps</font>

922
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,959
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for Hadoop we need to</font>

923
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:01,359
perform threat modeling and this is

924
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,099
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> key because if you walk through</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire documentation of Hadoop it</font>

926
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:07,990
will take days to fully implement all of

00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this mechanisms and that even then there</font>

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,430
you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> missed something right so</font>

930
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:17,529
threat modeling will allow you to pin

931
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,779
down what release should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I be securing</font>

again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

943
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,900
organizations typically do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is eliminate</font>

944

sensitive data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> paducah if it's not</font>

945
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,400
really crucial to your big data

946
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,819
installation filter it at the source so

947
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,230
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a sense I mean put some</font>

948
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:00,940
mechanisms to go and filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data</font>

949
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:03,400
out analyze what what data you're

950
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,710
getting it from your sensors are<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

951
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,530
feed or what work whichever mechanism

952
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,510
you use big data forum and filter some

953
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:13,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that sensitive data are those phone</font>

954
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers for example for the ones that</font>

955
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,640
you cannot eliminate use field level

956
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:21,040
encryption and use OS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> file level</font>

957
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,819
encryption mechanisms and I think you

958
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,150
pointed that out so that's that's that's

959
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:30,540
a good one but avoid vendor lock-in in

960
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:35,650
my opinion for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloudera</font>

961
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:37,680
distribution has or simplifies some of

962
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:40,599
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hortonworks</font>

963
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,419
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel also has a separate</font>

964
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,190
distribution that targets encryption but

965
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">again it requires adding some capability</font>

966
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:50,020
in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel processors so there</font>

967
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,150
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of catch-22 situations with</font>

968
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,400
some of these so in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> I avoid a</font>

969
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,050
specific flavor just because my users

970
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,420
would be used to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very hard to</font>

971
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:00,040
wean them away but it could be a viable

972
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,150
one where your threats are too high to

973
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,460
simply do it on yourself you can use a

974
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:09,700
commercial flavor of for example or

975
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:12,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cassandra for now run in a secure</font>

976
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,730
environment I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> really so I looked at</font>

977
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,560
all of these these aspects and for a

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:20,680
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise if you want to secure</font>

979
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,779
it it is very hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it in a time</font>

00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame and be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to support it</font>

981
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:26,829

982
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:30,519
best answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a sectarian</font>

985
00:45:34,029 --> 00:45:41,169

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network create public and private</font>

988
00:45:42,969 --> 00:45:46,749
subnets and show that your data or data

989
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,909
nodes are only running in your private

990
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:51,339
subnets your access servers are running

991
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:54,759
in your public subnets create a gateway

992
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:56,679
that that controls access to these

993
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:58,419
servers you maybe have to login into

994
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,219
that gateway and then you get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

995
00:45:58,419 --> 00:46:02,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cluster and you can provide access</font>

996
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:05,109
control like that at that layer as well

997
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,658
and defense in depth so I exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

998
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:10,469
that that only allowed traffic from to

999
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:14,380
flow from the trusted nodes to the

1000
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:15,969
innermost nodes so that way you get one

1001
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,709
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional layer whether you know</font>

1002
00:46:15,969 --> 00:46:20,259
that if somebody compromised as a data

1003
00:46:17,709 --> 00:46:24,219
node you not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come the other</font>

1004
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:27,429
way round<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one is what we did as</font>

1005
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:29,229
well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to some of these so</font>

1006
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:30,959
most of these we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually</font>

1007
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:34,239
implemented there are some that has to

1008
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:35,979
work in progress this is a decision

1009
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,329
pending on some of those so like we

1010
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:40,029
developed our own custom interface to

1011
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:42,909
accept jobs this freed us from having to

1012
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:46,349
expose the entire Hadoop job config API

1013
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:51,189
that allows user a access to user be so

1014
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:52,959
we wrote our own there is a thing I mean

1015
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:55,239
there's a open source project called

1016

1019
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:02,618
trying this out what I do not know is

1020
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:04,959
how it affects scalability so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1023
00:47:06,969 --> 00:47:11,349
figure out and if you can't wait for the

1024
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:12,999
project I know to complete and depending

1025
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:15,369
on the threat model you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1026
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:17,618
enable Kerberos<font color="#E5E5E5"> right an authorization</font>

1027
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,890
it just boils down to setting a bunch of

1028
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:22,209
parameters to true not not terribly hard

1029
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,949
but then I think you still need a

1030
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:27,069
Kerberos admin for some of the initial

1031

<font color="#E5E5E5">dns server settings integrate logging</font>

1032
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:33,249
there are few examples there encrypt the

1033
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,578
Kerberos RPC remember the key exchanges

1034
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:39,149
part so this must be encrypted

1035
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,190
if you are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kerberos encrypt the</font>

1039

1040
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,400
general I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I am yeah so I'll</font>

1041
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:55,019
use ldap to manage groups develop and

1042
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,269
deploy custom authentication filters for

1043

1044
00:47:57,269 --> 00:48:02,758
you can do is we wrote our own filter

1045
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,109
servlet filter and this plugged in there

1046
00:48:02,759 --> 00:48:05,549
and that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do our own</font>

1047
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:11,969
authentication instead of relying on

1048
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:14,069
spin go which I totally against so this

1049
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:15,779
allowed us to use our own authentication

1050
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:18,150

1054
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,259
want to create file level use groups on

1055
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,828
all of this and have to go and manage

1056
00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:27,829
these groups
