1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:09,760
hi and welcome to seconds per Causton

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:11,889
sort of live at secti we just grabbed

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,329
Ravi and out of tough when they went off

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:18,880
stage talking about 5 g + MC catchers so

5
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:22,898
can you please give us short intro to

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,450
the talk ok yeah thanks for the giving

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:30,279
this opportunity and experience your

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,960
podcast so our talk is about the way we

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:33,850
have been seeing a lot of controversy

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,160
about Phi G what it has implications

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,840
some countries are banning it some

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,178
operators or something like this so this

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
is talk about giving some of highlights

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:45,489
what exactly is the technical glitch or

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,320
issue we may face in future and how this

16
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:49,269
could be having effect on national

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,769
critical infrastructure or or nations

18
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:52,449
for example so we try to give that

19
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:54,190
glimpse and as well as a classical

20
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:57,070
problem with mobile communication is

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,899
about its being your mobile devices are

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,800
being track or intercept and these are

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,540
like MC catcher device are being used

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,149
unlawfully as well which is not being so

25
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,950
example so how this how this is possible

26
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:10,329
in Phi Z or not this is exactly we're

27
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,820
talking in this talk as well

28
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:16,869
yeah we're also are the main differences

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,240
with the 5g standard and the 4G the

30
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,460
current one the main standard is about

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,589
the new revolution in the core network

32
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,780
that has been happen so we have a

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,689
completely evolved network it's not

34
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,430
still not it's not revolutionary it's

35
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,350
evolved love story basically we don't

36
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,149
think that it's a revolt in this kind of

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,729
a new brand it's not a brand new it's

38
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:39,070
evolved but we have been adopting the

39
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,420
new changes which happen in the internet

40
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,059
world that we are going to the

41
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,860
virtualize networks yeah and this is

42
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,439
being adopted in Phi G and that's what

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,180
it's a new challenging network where we

44
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,130
are adopting same internet kind of a

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,590
style of virtualize network or protocols

46
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,750
and that that increased the existing

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,520
cyber security risk of Internet to this

48
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,609
world as well which is to be a closed

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,079
walled garden the telco dinner world and

50
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:07,419
now it's being open or opening up do you

51
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:13,709
focus tell all about lie like the EMC

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:17,760
the part where the user Yui the user

53
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:21,510
he used device how it's sort of

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,450
communicated with with network and how

55
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,649
it identified the seven and as you said

56
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,230
earlier you try to to track the user

57
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,159
devices using the EMC now you found some

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,988
new ways to do this yes yes and Altaf

59
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,679
yeah so like you mentioned like okay MC

60
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:43,409
was something tracking based on MC was

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,150
something active till in 4G so in 5g

62
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,340
they tried to correct it so they want to

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,650
protect this MC because it's a permanent

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,680
identifier so somehow it reveals

65
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,389
identity of a subscriber so so they came

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,519
up with this idea of like encrypting the

67
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,530
MC and when it went before actually

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,750
selling over the air so that subscriber

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,909
identity is protected so what we tried

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,980
something new was like okay even though

71
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,810
you are protecting MC the device is

72
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,319
sending its capabilities to the network

73
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,840
in plaintext so and we found that there

74
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,819
were unique ways of identifying devices

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,919
based on these capabilities so if we

76
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,619
started looking into that and trying to

77
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,540
find how we can fingerprint devices

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,720
different type of devices either it

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,709
could be cars or phones or different IOT

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,810
devices or laptops so everything is

81
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,189
having a modem now and then it's easy to

82
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,849
fingerprint them so we started looking

83
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,668
into that

84
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:38,010
then found different fingerprints for a

85
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,870
different type of devices then from

86
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,090
there we started to dig more trying to

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,419
find what kind of applications it's

88
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,699
running for example it's a phone or it's

89
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:49,799
a router or what kind of operating

90
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,739
system it's running maybe Android or

91
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,989
maybe I was if it's an iOS and what kind

92
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,449
of wash and it's running so all trying

93
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,989
to identify so just summarize simply if

94
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,579
he runs his equipment now he can tell

95
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,259
you without looking at your pockets that

96
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,819
you are using iPhone and he can also

97
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,768
tell you whether you are using iPhone X

98
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,208
or iPhone 8 without looking at for

99
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,099
example yeah and he can also tell that

100
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,340
whether these guys using Hawaii or a

101
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,289
samsung phone or what exactly even

102
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,349
finder modulates he can tell by without

103
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,789
looking at your device I can't just by

104
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,520
looking at the radio parameter which is

105
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,169
happening without knowing you because

106
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,049
these are the digital devices which

107
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,240
continuously emits the

108
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,180
messages over there and that's what we

109
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,979
listen and try to recognize it's pretty

110
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,990
cool you can do that already in the

111
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:38,060
radio layer you haven't well let's begin

112
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,120
to talk to the applications or something

113
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,490
like that you just radio yeah yeah but

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,949
then you can't as an in the inci case

115
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,319
you can't really pinpoint a user you can

116
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,750
say that this is an iphone user but

117
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,190
that's the close you get right exactly

118
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,410
yeah yeah I mean the level of

119
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,750
fingerprinting is it's not too precise

120
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,270
but if you're looking for like some

121
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,490
special devices like I said yeah devices

122
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,799
from the military are different yeah

123
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,180
they will stick out yeah and it could

124
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,909
really help you like when you have a

125
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,229
target attack for cars for instance or

126
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:11,750
something like that could really help

127
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,430
you in that think of you imagine a

128
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,110
situation there is a power plant and I

129
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,319
wanted to know which kind of sensors are

130
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,849
being deployed and if I figure out by

131
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,380
just looking at the sensors and I know

132
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,930
that this sensor sorry using the

133
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,580
critical area or critical buildings or

134
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,380
something like this so it gives some

135
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,060
into the tacit yeah for sure it's an

136
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,820
information disclosure yeah exactly

137
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,800
and that gives some stepping stone for

138
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,449
the TAC to learn something and and this

139
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,919
is what exactly we try to address to

140
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,469
standard people that shake some

141
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,930
preconditions and then know how to yeah

142
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:44,330
gain further access or commence and

143
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,620
design another exactly our point was if

144
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,270
you don't need this information why

145
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,580
don't we ask this information after the

146
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,900
authentication hanging right so it makes

147
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,909
sense to share this critical information

148
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,039
which gives something to the tacit and

149
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:57,199
nowadays attackers are getting evolves

150
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,659
so that's what it's more important to be

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,880
one step ahead yeah they're for them and

152
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:06,560
I think you also created a tool like

153
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,080
mobile and map and you can use that as a

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,479
passive listener but then you need a

155
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,250
USRP as well right so you need some so

156
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,289
what do you need if I want to let's

157
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,020
start doing this what is the minimum

158
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,199
like a mini PC yeah and an SDR board

159
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,359
yeah I mean we are like a constant using

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,370
us our piece right because we are using

161
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,810
them for quite a lot of time but yeah

162
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,550
but it cost somewhere around like

163
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,340
thousand dollars yeah but there are also

164
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,650
like other SDR boards like Lyme STR

165
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,659
which are way cheaper like 250 dollars

166
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,580
yeah so if you can just integrate that

167
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:41,000
with the PC you have I think

168
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,310
you have the tool yeah an interesting

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,860
surveillance platform to see your mobile

170
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,270
devices but yeah I mean you are right

171
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,250
but we don't want to give the intention

172
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,950
that we are doing this for a bad purpose

173
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,920
the point is the people who define those

174
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,870
standard they they assume that the

175
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,000
attack will no longer be possible

176
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,890
because the the the capability of

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,750
attacker has to be more he has to put

178
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,890
more cost to build these tools and that

179
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,200
yes this is not we want to prove that

180
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,419
with using two hundred US dollar having

181
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,800
some open source knowledge if we can do

182
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,180
this I mean attacker having yeah yeah

183
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,130
this is about proving the point rather

184
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:24,320
than saying theoretical way indeed I

185
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,030
understand one of your attacks right I

186
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,640
think was the bidding down the down

187
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,260
great attack you can actually use these

188
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,810
capabilities and put a man-in-the-middle

189
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,690
attack because they are unencrypted or

190
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,820
unsecure so you can change the

191
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,520
capabilities between the use advice and

192
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,250
the real network so you can convince the

193
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,680
network and the mobile device that well

194
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,300
I can't even use these hi cool

195
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,050
5g features so well they need to

196
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,880
downgrade to 2g with that Homa all also

197
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,890
mean that they will downgrade like the

198
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,010
authentication pot so I will totally

199
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,099
revert to 2g no indication actually

200
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:06,170
happens yeah yeah I thought your data

201
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:09,110
traffic and everything is secure so it's

202
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,820
debit so it's just voice over 2g to 3G

203
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,190
then yeah and then you're killing the

204
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,890
speed of the device which is I think the

205
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,600
most essential one today like if I'm if

206
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,580
my YouTube takes like just to watch a

207
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,820
video like ten minutes for like one

208
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,419
minute video yeah not good but will you

209
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:30,110
be able to do 2g and 3G attacks that is

210
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,750
decrypt the communication not not the

211
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,669
data but the voice or that we can't do

212
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,679
in 3G but we can do in 2g only yeah

213
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:41,270
because that's not possible with 3G 4G

214
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:44,449
as well because but so if you manage to

215
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,520
by manipulating the Yui capabilities you

216
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,970
can manage to downgrade to 2g you could

217
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,660
actually listen in on the calls as long

218
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:55,269
as we have the property first

219
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,620
yeah unlike preconditions but yeah but

220
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,970
there are the best of world but there

221
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,069
are other ways of interception that we

222
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,050
haven't talked in something there are

223
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,779
many legitimate or illegitimate way that

224
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,099
you also get encryption in 4G maybe in

225
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,810
five years well so there are different

226
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,089
scenarios yeah I think it's such an a

227
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:13,029
really important point in the end there

228
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,589
many operators aren't really they don't

229
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,709
know the details of their own network

230
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,569
they use hardware directly from the

231
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,449
vendors Mormo the more or less default

232
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:24,339
and they have no knowledge on how to

233
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:26,008
actually change the settings and stuff

234
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:29,199
that and what to change them to

235
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:31,329
something that's so scary yeah yeah

236
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:34,870
exactly for like critical infrastructure

237
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:37,329
that everyone uses happens a lot yeah

238
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,160
but but the thing is the devices in

239
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,290
themself has lawful interception

240
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,990
capabilities when you're in attached to

241
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,019
the back end right so you can actually

242
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,240
lawfully or similar family yeah someone

243
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,589
could listen in yeah I mean lawfully I

244
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,209
mean as long as you bring the court

245
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,189
order against some persons and then

246
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,569
police or they can legally listen and

247
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,670
that's what standard also does it so

248
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,259
it's not like we don't provide because

249
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,699
every technology has two sides right

250
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,620
yeah that's what you need to have

251
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,719
standard as well it's only the point

252
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,589
that some other nation-state actors

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,529
should not exploit those against

254
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:13,209
citizens or hopefully hopefully yeah you

255
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,980
mentioned you have you have looked into

256
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,979
how different operators in different

257
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,439
countries actually how they act when it

258
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,209
comes to UE capabilities is stuff like

259
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:24,099
and you can see like different patterns

260
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,099
from different ISP what kind of settings

261
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:29,290
I'll be using yes because like I mean in

262
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,779
this we only present like one scenario

263
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,349
yeah the capabilities before security

264
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:34,540
yeah

265
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,579
so we observe like lot of differences in

266
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,569
different operators so not only like

267
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:39,699
when you're when the phone is

268
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,170
registering but if you go after like

269
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,649
memy maybe when you are making voice

270
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,300
call

271
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,000
there are also capabilities being

272
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,910
accessed but it's it's very different

273
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,379
like so it depends on the vendor from

274
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,059
whom they're actually buying this I

275
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:56,230
think there are a couple of vendors so

276
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:57,670
it's really different and we saw like a

277
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,380
lot of different patterns in different

278
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,229
operational and your work has resulted

279
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,660
in some sort of like recommendations for

280
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,020
for operators these are the setting

281
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,850
issues

282
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:12,400
Jews yes we already like push this to

283
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,440
the GSMA I think they actually took this

284
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,230
issue forward like communicated with the

285
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,810
operators then the standards body 3gpp

286
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,030
so they actually address this issue so

287
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,760
now the capabilities will be accessed

288
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:30,010
only after security standard and there

289
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,110
is a new update for the standard that

290
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,450
has been corrected so it's not the

291
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,930
guideline but we change the standard

292
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,180
have you seen

293
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,890
I think it's cached and null was been

294
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,900
looking into creating a map of the world

295
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,490
of the different operators and what kind

296
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,160
of security settings they been using I

297
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,900
think his focus was a GSM

298
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,329
so something similar that could possibly

299
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,620
be used in your case that like map

300
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,320
what kind of settings been used for the

301
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,810
different operators yeah the the this

302
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,690
this could be one scenario but I think

303
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,119
it's the kind of map we which have we

304
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,740
had a 2g it was not being updated and

305
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,090
it's not the reliable the point is you

306
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,310
have the map but you don't have a data

307
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,920
to check it right so you don't need you

308
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,479
to blindly trust them by the picture so

309
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,130
if you give that real data as well to

310
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,620
the end-user saying that ok this was the

311
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,510
data from downtown in Stockholm and it's

312
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,370
just 2 G map so she shows the data

313
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,569
because people trust the date I mean we

314
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,550
are in the world where we need any data

315
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,470
so that map doesn't give you so it's a

316
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,030
good way for us to see that whether we

317
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,400
can have the real data attached with the

318
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:29,020
map where like you user can check or if

319
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,150
your work guy from Ericsson or whatever

320
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,010
the company you can reevaluate this is

321
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,600
the correct or wrong that's like a best

322
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,130
way of doing it in two ways so we are

323
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,270
trying to also go in that direction

324
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:42,370
hopefully yeah because like if GSM a

325
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,230
adopts is the new standard it doesn't

326
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,080
really matter if the operators doesn't

327
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,430
act and operators don't act if they

328
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,470
don't get pressured tracked because

329
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,699
acting cost money right yeah there are

330
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,290
some new activities going in Pfizer

331
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,210
standard about security assurance

332
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,829
standards or something like this where

333
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,120
they try to force every operator to

334
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,860
follow this practice sort of

335
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,300
certification or some yeah kind of does

336
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,400
but I don't know how this disc in

337
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,469
applicable to every part of the network

338
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,000
or this is only for few network blocks

339
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,010
for example so it's good to see that a

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,600
GSM a or somebody takes actions that

341
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,220
some operators should have this

342
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,890
practices or these are the best practice

343
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,810
so the problem is it has to be mandated

344
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,430
locally because you can't enforce the

345
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,050
worldwide law right so

346
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,880
country has a local regulation that you

347
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,500
should have this and I need it take your

348
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,260
own position in it how they won't act

349
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,460
yeah yeah we'll see also what EU takes

350
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,460
the stance on it yeah

351
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,490
the Ross telecommunication is about to

352
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,740
become a national critical

353
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,250
infrastructure sure to follow those

354
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,290
guidelines

355
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,830
I hope so this becomes a lower mandate

356
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,420
from something like this yeah so if

357
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,620
people are interested in your work where

358
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,329
can they find more information

359
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,490
yeah the information I mean we as well

360
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,649
our own websites or where we do we work

361
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,940
like you work at work at center if we

362
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,830
have our blocks as well where we

363
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,260
continuously write and and release the

364
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,240
papers and everything and we just don't

365
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,649
only do the research by giving a talks

366
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,839
anything first we do scientific research

367
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,399
we publish the papers and then we

368
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,589
confirm with sanitation body whether

369
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,420
it's true or false then we release it so

370
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,920
this process takes more than one and a

371
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,170
half year or something I guess and then

372
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,660
it becomes at the end so all the proofs

373
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,339
are there the names standard the CV

374
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,610
everything on the GSMA website as well

375
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,570
where people find the information

376
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,520
thanks for ready to talk yeah

377
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,089
interesting thank you very much here yep

378
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,089
thanks
