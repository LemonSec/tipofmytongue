1
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,820
hi thanks thank you very much

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,000
so my name is Ravi Shankar poor dog I

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,550
work as a research scientist at sinden

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,860
in Norway I recently moved to Norway

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,460
from UK previously with University of

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:27,340
Oxford and this is Allah al Tawfiq he is

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,680
currently doing PhD at tu Berlin in

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,750
Germany that's also called secti but

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,969
that means security in telecommunication

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,960
not this sector okay so that's the

11
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:41,679
safety different Department and today we

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,379
briefly talk about Phi G security but

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,570
the point was first to cover radio part

14
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:49,748
but most of the time people have

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,789
interest to also listen about what new

16
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:54,370
has been done on the core network or

17
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,620
what there is a what is this controversy

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,659
going on people talking about Phi G and

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,608
different thing so we try to give this

20
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,460
highlight also in a short period of time

21
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,290
and then we focus on someone

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,270
laboratories which has been we

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:11,380
discovered and been about to fix for

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:13,210
example so I would skip the about me or

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,179
talking more about what we did in the

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,160
past anything but I will just say that

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,710
he's doing a PhD and I started my study

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,600
on mobile telecommunication and I can

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,509
proudly say I studied in the kthe in

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,210
2007 so that's like a 12 years back so I

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,520
learned to G 3G in Stockholm itself in

32
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,309
2007 and since then I am say working on

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,350
on the same stack so we just straight

34
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,200
ahead go to the 5g now how many people

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,280
know 5g in the room or been working or

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,570
something so so couple of people so I

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,580
will try to do a speed up the things

38
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,830
rather than speaking on what is new

39
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,440
feature or marketing term marketing

40
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,270
stuff or anything I will just say what

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,460
exactly we're gonna see this year and

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,800
what we're gonna say and after couple of

43
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,440
years so we're gonna have a billions of

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,450
devices trying to connect to each other

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,310
or maybe to the different or maybe you

46
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,229
will use those devices as a personal

47
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,319
devices and this will keep growing and

48
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,450
since 2009 this is already and some

49
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,548
countries have started to deploy 5g

50
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,329
networks so we have a Phi 3 base

51
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:18,070
stations being

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,410
deployed as a pilot or something right

53
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,540
now we know and and and these networks

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,940
are basically or these base stations are

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,489
connected to a 4g core network that's

56
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,490
the existing 4G network we have and then

57
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:33,940
that's what we called non standalone

58
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,370
mode that's a one type of Phi G which we

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,350
are being saying in the world and the

60
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,880
second type what we will see many

61
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,710
operators are being deployed

62
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,690
slowlyslowly some are already trying

63
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,090
that but that's the second time which

64
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,800
will have a 5g towers being deployed and

65
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,260
then we have a fight the new core

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,350
network and this is basically called

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,989
standalone mode and that we will see

68
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,579
maybe next year for example or there are

69
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,010
summation operators are trying this

70
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,650
approach as well for example so it's

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,600
there are different strategies the way

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,880
you deploy those networks depending on

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,890
the cost and deployment types but this

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,480
is just to give you start and what is

75
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,450
the problem we people are talking about

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,489
basically about this second type of

77
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,619
network which is called standalone mode

78
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,060
because this is pretty much evolved

79
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,300
networks many things has been

80
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,209
drastically changed and in next couple

81
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,750
of slides I will try to cover that up

82
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:31,120
and why actually u5g is becoming problem

83
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,959
or why people also says this will be a

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,750
bug issue it's just that now if you look

85
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,730
at this picture we have 100 Mbps as a

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,769
broadband speed so I live in Norway now

87
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,690
still I get 50 Mbps but when I was

88
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,640
living in Finland I mean I had a pretty

89
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,230
much higher speed than what used to get

90
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,170
to the Prada band speed but roughly

91
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,359
average we have 100 Mbps and what my G

92
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,790
is being promising nowadays is like 5

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,380
Gbps I am still realistically skeptical

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,829
about that because if you look at the

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:02,680
Sun like we taste the people are getting

96
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,600
to 1.2 Gbps in Korea or sizzle sizzle

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,400
and when the deplored Network but is

98
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,519
still better than the wired so can you

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,470
imagine after 10 or 15 years will people

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,200
start digging more ground to put the

101
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:17,168
cables or every device will use wireless

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,209
so you see the comparison between where

103
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:21,700
we are moving so next 20 years maybe

104
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,010
everything will be wireless and we no

105
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,960
longer use broadband connectivity which

106
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,210
barely giving you handed Mbps you can

107
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,370
argue me saying that fine we can get the

108
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,229
broad we can get the gigabit connection

109
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,760
or something like this but still how

110
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,530
much gigabyte you want to consume that's

111
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,080
also another kind of a trade-off so

112
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,969
basically we are making this by G as a

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,740
national critical infrastructure already

114
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,540
when we're looking at 10 20 years that

115
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,030
every device literally gonna talk over

116
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:50,139
the wireless channel right and this is

117
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,419
what the network has some new changes

118
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,370
has been made and and we try to just

119
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,049
scratch the surface about how this

120
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,060
architecture looks like and where are

121
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,040
the problems and we use some example of

122
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,770
those problems then you can just make a

123
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,910
logical conclusion yourself what is this

124
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,620
fuss about on 5e security so when we see

125
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,270
the network we classically divided in

126
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,100
two style I will just try to keep

127
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,740
minimal and simple so this is a very

128
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,479
abstract level view so don't count me

129
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,699
saying that okay you are the wrong guy

130
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,909
who's who represented different

131
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,289
architecture by a standard or 3gpp

132
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,210
literally trust me you you will no

133
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,070
longer understand those like ten

134
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,630
thousand documents with different

135
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,210
abbreviations or anything like this I am

136
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,039
trying to avoid that so you had a radio

137
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,750
network which is basically we call radio

138
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,610
access network so that consists of your

139
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,919
mobile phone and the tower which you see

140
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,690
in the buildings or or surroundings area

141
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,190
yeah with the towers right that's the

142
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,650
radio access network and then you have a

143
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,870
core network core network means there

144
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,969
could be a building of Taliah or Telenor

145
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,740
where you will see there all the servers

146
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,430
are being there which are being used for

147
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,830
called call switching or or the support

148
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,800
of the call services and what has been

149
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,630
happening since last 30 years we are

150
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,699
getting development into the radio part

151
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,380
as well in terms of the speed what you

152
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,599
get with wireless but we are also

153
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,960
getting different kind of improvements

154
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,330
with the core network and slowly slowly

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,190
we are moving towards the Internet so it

156
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,050
means that classically we used to have a

157
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,440
special signaling protocols in the core

158
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,820
network everything was proprietary

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,979
standardized by dominated by few

160
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,930
companies in the world and slowly it's

161
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:28,419
moving some new companies are coming up

162
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,400
in the game and standard is being coming

163
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:32,889
towards the internet style of protocols

164
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,989
and this is what we are saying now and

165
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,690
this is what you look now the 5g

166
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,419
architecture so this this is clearly of

167
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,370
Phi G architecture by the standard I am

168
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,139
NOT going to explain those blocks for

169
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,759
example what you have but

170
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,770
this is a diagram to tell you the

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,400
significance because in terms of a

172
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:53,680
wireless what is important the first

173
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,448
point is when you make a mobile phone

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,970
call or when you use your internet data

175
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,830
for mail what is the encryption starting

176
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,990
point and what is the encryption ending

177
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,219
because end-to-end encryption that's

178
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,530
what we talk about right

179
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,240
and now imagine when you make a 5g phone

180
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,128
call let's talk about where the

181
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,840
encryption starts and ends as per the

182
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,090
Phi G and this this sets the critical

183
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,440
task actually because this this you can

184
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,109
decide whether it's a end to end or not

185
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,849
Phi G so you decide yourself so what

186
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,430
happens if you see this figure do you

187
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,530
see the cursor yes so this is basically

188
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,870
a mobile phone you have when you have

189
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,969
Phi G this called you user equipment and

190
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,710
this will have a SIM card and nowadays

191
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,300
we are moving towards the new SIM card

192
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,969
which is called embedded SIM card and

193
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,069
this G node B means the base station and

194
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,979
in Phi G they decided to split this base

195
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:39,759
station into two types which is called

196
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,630
centralizing it and one is called

197
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,789
distributed in it

198
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,729
the reason behind this distribution

199
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,919
let's assume that this area may have a

200
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,620
4G base stations like a 10 base stations

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,770
to serve this half a kilometer area so

202
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,389
in Phi G we may need 20 because we need

203
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,270
to double the number of base station to

204
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,919
serve the capacity and speed and it may

205
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,440
be kids that these base stations maybe

206
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,090
deploy on the street lamp or on the bus

207
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,279
stop or somewhere with unsecured

208
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,008
location basically so you can split the

209
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,750
network into Cu and D U and what is

210
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,210
being happening actually if the operator

211
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,009
doesn't deploy si UD you model so this

212
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,388
your basically your encryption starts on

213
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,029
a mobile phone and ends on the base

214
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:20,770
station so it means if somebody

215
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:23,259
compromised the base stations you gonna

216
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,979
get a plaintext traffic okay and this is

217
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,569
the case with even 4G network and this

218
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,279
is what people ask me what is the best

219
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,320
network you see in terms of radio

220
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,439
actually the 3G was the best which we

221
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,909
gonna about to kill because in 3G your

222
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,070
encryption was never-ending on a base

223
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,659
station it was partly ending on the core

224
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,149
network infrastructure it means it was

225
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,709
ending on a physical node which was

226
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,779
somewhere in the building which which is

227
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,729
secured location so your call was ending

228
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:50,709
there but not in Phi G Phi Z it will end

229
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,449
on the base station straight ahead so if

230
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,640
you compromised the base station by any

231
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,050
means or whatever it is basically you

232
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,580
get plaintext traffic there of course

233
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,370
it's encrypted from there but

234
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,350
different IPSec tunnel so it's again the

235
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,140
way you compromise or or take over the

236
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,910
box for example and what the new things

237
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,209
has been changed again this is basically

238
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,829
a core network now we have more tortoise

239
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,869
service space architecture so this is

240
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,750
the most promising change part in the

241
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,300
core network it has been evolved so the

242
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,130
IG has adopted service based model a

243
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,560
service mode service based architecture

244
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,140
so and the reason behind this I mean I'm

245
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,029
not going in detail but just service has

246
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,699
to be deploys so much fast and quickly

247
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,589
and that's what they decided to use a

248
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,000
new arc service based architecture in

249
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:38,769
that regard and the point is this is

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,660
somewhat people or I will come back to

251
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,760
this point so why these people say about

252
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,949
why this has been changed or evolved so

253
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,870
basically this is combination of few

254
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,120
technologies and then and this is what

255
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,430
interesting it makes interesting so it's

256
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,190
a combination of cloud computing

257
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,870
programmable networks NFB or mobile is

258
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,269
computing so we are trying to order up

259
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,850
the cloud base architecture now into the

260
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,649
core network so it means that we are

261
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,630
moving towards the virtualized word or

262
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,310
or I would say the telco is trying to

263
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,170
add up the virtualized network

264
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,819
functionality it means that we will have

265
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,329
the same kind of hardware which running

266
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,410
on different kind of a virtualized

267
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:15,910
software's which we also use in a cloud

268
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,339
computing for example so this is being

269
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,930
adopted in the network now so you no

270
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,910
longer have a physical devices running

271
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,649
somewhere it could be a cloud basically

272
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,699
which running everything so it if I give

273
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:29,290
example if a telly node for Italia has a

274
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,459
infrastructure running in somewhere in

275
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,649
the building which is physical

276
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:35,170
infrastructure IT infrastructure now

277
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,390
this can be going to the cloud which

278
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,310
could be their own cloud or they can

279
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,899
rent somebody else cloud or whatever it

280
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,540
is so that's what the there is there

281
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,160
will be a less physical separation on

282
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,589
that regard and what has been changed if

283
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,750
I compare with existing network so we

284
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:53,890
used to have a separated core network an

285
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,839
and ran network with 4G networks we had

286
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,390
a dedicated literally dedicated hardware

287
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,220
to run the core network component we

288
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,260
also used to have as I said propriety

289
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,029
protocols when we use for G inside

290
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,890
signaling so many people have heard

291
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,449
about ss7 signaling attacks or something

292
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,100
like this right so these are like a

293
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,660
propriety protocol which also been

294
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,340
exploited but that's

295
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,290
and this was difficult to modify

296
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,880
services when the customer demands there

297
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,800
is a new something new they want so it

298
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,330
takes a long time to order for any

299
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,530
companies to provide new services

300
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,050
because you have to change many

301
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:26,110
component and this was not that flexible

302
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,819
and now with 5g now we have a less

303
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,280
separated core and network it's still

304
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,410
separated but logical separation and I

305
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,689
think the organizers of this conference

306
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,939
were smart enough to arrange all the

307
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,530
cloud security talks in the morning and

308
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,060
now we're going to separate those in the

309
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,589
cloud infrastructure and we already saw

310
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,420
some attacks on the cloud I mean I mean

311
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,920
this is just a reference for example how

312
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,290
much separation you made in the in that

313
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,260
regard and configuring software and

314
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,819
hardware and the funny thing is now they

315
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,490
have replaced the system in signaling

316
00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:00,730
protocol with risk-based Java API and

317
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,640
you imagine any attacker now who wants

318
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,520
to attack ss7 signaling here - he has to

319
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,860
just literally read everything about ss7

320
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,449
it's a proprietary protocol or it's not

321
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,700
much documentation available not many

322
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,440
tools available he had to read those

323
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,080
documents make an attack or something

324
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,970
like this to exploit in real time and

325
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,700
now here attackers just need to learn

326
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,590
the rest rest rest based Java API switch

327
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,150
everybody is working or or useful lava

328
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,130
or the knowledge and those it is to

329
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,500
dismiss api is basically has to be

330
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:31,000
secured with TLS and SSL so we are

331
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,470
moving towards that area with core

332
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,240
network and and this is pretty much

333
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,180
challenging for the mobile operators to

334
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,340
nearly secure this and and what the

335
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,900
problem is basically coming now we will

336
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,830
have an increase attack surface with

337
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,420
what we say but I think where so far we

338
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,930
are doing research we tried to convert

339
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,430
use a smartphone basically as a it's a

340
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,989
smart device but it's a slave device

341
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,689
many people say smart means dumb

342
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,240
security but in mobile world smart means

343
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,740
slave because mobile phone is smartphone

344
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,200
but is the slave basically because it

345
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,300
just packs the way your base station

346
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,640
says and that's what the fake base

347
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,079
station attack has too much priority and

348
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,090
has been given attention in Phi G

349
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,680
through prevent fake base station attack

350
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,780
any fake base station comes and ask

351
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,459
mobile phone hey let's talk plaintext I

352
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,930
don't use encryption so you're providing

353
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,590
mobile phone says ok fine let's use

354
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,719
plain text

355
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,480
he has no role saying that no no I stick

356
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,430
with a Phi 3 or of stronger encryption

357
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,750
he has no role of saying and the

358
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,569
design has been followed the same

359
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,430
approach no change at all so there is no

360
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,290
negotiation it has on key exchange or

361
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,079
anything so that's what we will have

362
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,760
bidding down attacks as usual because as

363
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,320
long as you can lock your phone so how

364
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,110
many people have a phone which they can

365
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,260
lock on let's say on 4G can you lock

366
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,300
your phone on 4G yes and you rely on the

367
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,980
Android function that it really locks it

368
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,529
right because this is a physical lock

369
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,820
separation for example but very few

370
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,589
phone has it and it's not a mandatory

371
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,970
that every vendor should actually have

372
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,920
that feature on your mobile phone

373
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,830
very few phone give this feature or some

374
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,750
phone it will just say 2g 3G 4G or you

375
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,839
will just have a 4G and 3G for example

376
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,370
so very few very phone if you Fiona have

377
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,620
this then we have a denial of service

378
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,180
attack wireless as usual and an

379
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,750
interception somewhat it has been fixed

380
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,969
but not completely with 5g Co Network it

381
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,740
just the summarization but as we are

382
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,000
moving to us virtualized world so as

383
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,040
usual then we have a cloud security

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,510
different aspect virtualization as well

385
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,029
because then you're gonna virtualize

386
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,950
many inaccurate network elements and you

387
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,959
will have a third party API for example

388
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,029
now you deploy the cloud services you

389
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,380
need a firewall or antivirus and you you

390
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,080
need to give a different access with the

391
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,760
tokens to firewall deploy vendor could

392
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,620
beat any vendor or something so you need

393
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,330
to protect that you don't expose many

394
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,250
elements of a cloud to the third party

395
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,870
vendor or those kind of separations you

396
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,089
have a problem as well this is classical

397
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,640
problem on this regard and this is one

398
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,110
example basically I try to give you why

399
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,850
what it means why increase attack

400
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,779
surprise so what people are trying to

401
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,150
say basically so we'll have a

402
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,610
virtualization it means from base

403
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,620
stations your data may go to the edge

404
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,690
cloud it could be a data center for

405
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,580
example so before it goes to the core

406
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,680
network it goes to the local data center

407
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,900
it or its edge data center what we say

408
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,969
and basically they will have a clear

409
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,260
separation of services so let's assume

410
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,029
that on the right side is a cloud-based

411
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,010
core network or one data center of

412
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,350
element and they have a different cloud

413
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,120
instances for different services and the

414
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,010
first is for gaming uses what this

415
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,050
marketing is about some game users can

416
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,730
have a high-speed dedicated service

417
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,529
whenever they use fighty service for

418
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,240
playing the games one is for smart grid

419
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,839
or something and one is for normal users

420
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,220
so we can replicate this services with

421
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,250
emergency services or or whatever you

422
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,230
name it differ

423
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,760
classical separation and of course they

424
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,990
assume that you will protect all these

425
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:46,460
instances using hypervisor security and

426
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,020
it's like we have a blade through fiber

427
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,430
visor security and that's what we see

428
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,930
there are many commercial providers you

429
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,520
did try to give you the protections on

430
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,400
those elements and now we have to ensure

431
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,470
that attacker when he is using any end

432
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,209
devices or somebody is compromising the

433
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,070
base stations which are at and secure

434
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:04,280
locations they may not able to attack

435
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,930
this cloud part or maybe this this whole

436
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,189
block is not connected to the internet

437
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,510
that you will have a remote attacks

438
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,580
which are coming over your cloud

439
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,600
interface so see this is like you are

440
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,520
opening up the or adopting the Internet

441
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,790
by cloud-based technology so it's you

442
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,800
you gonna at least realize that this

443
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,900
will come anyway and this to give a

444
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,490
significance of now if I really wanted

445
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,800
to compromise some of this element I

446
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,690
give you one classic example really

447
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,910
classic example this was the year of

448
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,950
2002 something around that if I'm not

449
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,040
wrong as seven something okay how many

450
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,560
people know Greek wiretapping scandal

451
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,280
say as some people know so very powerful

452
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,140
organization back in 2002 a compromise

453
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,600
when unique server in the core network

454
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,220
why it was unique this was called a

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,780
lawful interception so when you deploy

456
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,520
mobile network you need to provide

457
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,560
lawful interception capability to

458
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,020
government and this is mandatory and

459
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,000
this is standardized interface and the

460
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,470
way it has been built it's quite secret

461
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,180
or we don't know what exactly it runs

462
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,520
actually so it's like an special

463
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,079
interface built on I don't know Linux or

464
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,990
whatever the system is for example right

465
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,879
so somebody actually was able to build a

466
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,670
malware for this system and the malware

467
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,680
was so nice that somebody just put the

468
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,079
USB stick or they reinstall the whole

469
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,569
software on this machine and this

470
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,639
machine basically is is like a secret

471
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,409
police has a live tapping interface you

472
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,569
just feed a number and you get his all

473
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,150
the call records live literally live and

474
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,220
actually they they they they compromised

475
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,410
this machine so they got some mole

476
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,760
inside the employee ask him to give a

477
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,980
software or something like this and he

478
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,500
installed the software and for a couple

479
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,210
of months the the call record of big

480
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,330
prime minister or some Prime Minister

481
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,130
was continuously monitored and luckily

482
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,500
there was this one Swedish company

483
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:50,000
engineer he came to investigate what's

484
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,809
going wrong and he figured out that this

485
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,539
is not the soft

486
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,759
prodded by a Swedish company and it

487
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,679
Samoan so my point is the biggest

488
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,659
telecom vendor in Europe was not able to

489
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,429
recognize this attack at all so it was

490
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:04,279
the engineer who came to figure out why

491
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:05,809
this traffic is weird and we know he

492
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,009
check that why why it's what is the

493
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,990
problem so after six months they

494
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:11,330
recognize what is the problem and

495
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,830
actually it has a nice architecture and

496
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,840
diagram and everything like this so

497
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:17,090
imagine this was a propriety software

498
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,678
which very few people know and it was

499
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,658
being compromised that time and now we

500
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,590
are talking about we're gonna build this

501
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:26,059
block into the cloud okay now like this

502
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,889
kind of a blocks we're gonna build into

503
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:30,139
the cloud and we're gonna say that we we

504
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:32,748
protect this with hypervisor or whatever

505
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:34,459
it is and now imagine now how many

506
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:35,690
nation-state actor we have and how you

507
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,249
gonna protect this kind of

508
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,539
infrastructure against these attacks so

509
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,580
this is one example of a tip you can

510
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:42,350
compare with the logical reasoning the

511
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,360
way we are moving towards which side and

512
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,389
then the second we have sometimes we do

513
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,570
configuration mistakes like this was one

514
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:54,740
example of you do configuration mistakes

515
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,539
so one company in Belgium was doing pen

516
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,580
testing and they were just fuzzing some

517
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:00,590
packets actually and one of the core

518
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,689
components block of a network core

519
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,149
network actually he received some bad

520
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,740
packets in Norway because it is roaming

521
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:08,539
all the operators are connected to each

522
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,549
other so by mistake he receives some

523
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,669
fussing packets and the software got

524
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:15,190
crash just by few fuzzing packets and it

525
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,450
was not able to recover for two days

526
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,090
again that involves the biggest

527
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,009
convenient company in itself actually so

528
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,389
but my point is you don't have that

529
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:25,759
software which are being properly

530
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:26,449
secured properly pain tested or furs or

531
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,190
whatever it is

532
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,409
now you moving those blocks into the

533
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,110
core network protected with rest based

534
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:35,389
Java API and authentication tokens how

535
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,219
many people really do a bug bounty and

536
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,719
found one with your own risk miss Java

537
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,279
API token authentication bypass

538
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,080
something like this you just name it you

539
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,519
just find endless for example like those

540
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,889
examples I'm not saying that is

541
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,409
difficult to achieve but just the point

542
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:49,908
is look look at where you are moving and

543
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,649
the way you are controlling the data and

544
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,629
then we also have the Snowden kind of

545
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,668
incidents where people talk about they

546
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:57,529
had a master keys of every SIM card

547
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,970
being like they compromise the gemalto

548
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,399
and they got all the keys and everything

549
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,440
like this and now now we have a ECM a

550
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,639
sim means you never can get out of your

551
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,260
mobile phone

552
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,330
so it means when the mobile phone is

553
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,310
being manufactured in China or anywhere

554
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,260
it is it will be comes equipped on your

555
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,210
mobile phone and you can't take out the

556
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,530
SIM card and you may have heard last two

557
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,540
weeks before there was a company who

558
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,860
discovered the problem with SIM cards

559
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,930
somebody can send you command that

560
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,580
actually and it just into executing the

561
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,060
SIM card and it sends data back to the

562
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,949
server

563
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,450
this was like a standards will I will

564
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,890
send it one levity again and as the end

565
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,390
user I mean I don't have a control on my

566
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,610
mobile phone I can't take out the SIM

567
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,290
card now so it's quite a problematic in

568
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,850
that scenario and you just trust them

569
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,860
blindly what's going on or happening

570
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,629
inside and this was not new there's not

571
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,669
one document also had a malware for SIM

572
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,940
card as well like a Java applets with

573
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,110
SIM card for example so this is like

574
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,150
anyway then we have a denial of service

575
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,830
attacks this is quite obvious and this

576
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,980
is not really new but just to mention

577
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,620
because assuming we have a 1gbps at

578
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,030
least speed realistic way so you have to

579
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,250
protect it against denial of service

580
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,980
attacks with 1gbps on the radio side as

581
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,290
well as on the internet side so this is

582
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,650
this will be will have a new distributed

583
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:08,300
denial of service protection tools or

584
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,190
techniques so don't get surprised that

585
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,840
there are many company buying like this

586
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,190
especially the telco providers so this

587
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,139
will be a nice business for those

588
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,910
companies now coming back to the point

589
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,850
this is about the core network I mean we

590
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:23,630
touched some surface now we'll go into

591
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:26,149
the the main type main main contained

592
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:29,510
about have we solved the radio problems

593
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,940
of 4G and 3G in fuzzy or not or whether

594
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,890
the MC can really work or not now we we

595
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,600
begin to this type so what exactly this

596
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:40,640
this about and there are two types of

597
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,010
first of all when we say MC catcher for

598
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,490
this talk we only talk about track

599
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,560
locating a user tracking for example but

600
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,630
no interception because in C case it has

601
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,250
a definition that you track also you

602
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:55,010
intercept so we're not talking about

603
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,920
interception okay clear so no data

604
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,300
encryption no data interception or odd

605
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,400
call interception it's only about

606
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,919
identifying particular user in the area

607
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,780
if I use it or and also the tracking for

608
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,090
some time but we also now talk about

609
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,620
monitoring the user so we have a third

610
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,389
element of monitoring which hasn't been

611
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:15,290
done with MC catcher and there are two

612
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:17,390
types we do basically you know we try to

613
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,500
exploit some radio protocols but we also

614
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,300
try to exploit

615
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,250
protocol which is basically and main

616
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,899
authentication protocol in Phi G so I

617
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,330
will hand over 12 off and he will

618
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,930
explain you the first one levity and

619
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:35,330
then I will explain you the second one

620
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:37,040
yes so that now you have learned

621
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,500
something about five G so let's look

622
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,780
what we tried to exploit regarding the

623
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,050
protocols in 5g mostly on the radio

624
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,730
access side so we try to see that I mean

625
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,950
if you have seen the previous slide so

626
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,480
you saw that MC is actually encrypted in

627
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,760
5g so this is kind of an optional

628
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,400
feature that whenever the device is

629
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,050
sending MC or IMEI to the network so

630
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,080
these identities are actually like

631
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,909
encrypted so these are like the unique

632
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,919
identities that the SIM card and the the

633
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:07,580
phone has it so basically like you use

634
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,650
them to identify a user or or a phone so

635
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,030
we know that okay these are somehow

636
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,370
encrypted and then we started looking

637
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,470
what else we can try to actually fire

638
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,330
actually like fingerprint users or

639
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,860
fingerprint devices so we started

640
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,629
looking deep into protocols and then

641
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,300
then we came across something called

642
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,730
capabilities the word UE

643
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,879
means nothing but user equipment so it

644
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:31,310
could be a smartphone or it could be any

645
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,990
m2m device or or any device that has a

646
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,750
modem inside and trying to register to

647
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,980
the network can be called as a UE so we

648
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,870
came across this thing called

649
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,760
capabilities so when I talk like

650
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,610
capabilities of the device it doesn't

651
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,230
mean the the processor or the the

652
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,330
capable that the speed the RAM it

653
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,280
doesn't mean that so it's the modem

654
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,500
capabilities for example the

655
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,060
capabilities can be like two types like

656
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,040
we see it's like core network

657
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,350
capabilities then the second one is the

658
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,670
radio capabilities like the capabilities

659
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,100
in the sense like what kind of

660
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,780
frequencies its support or what kind of

661
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,659
like physical parameters does it support

662
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,490
carrier aggregation or the new my mo

663
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,390
technologies that that actually brings

664
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,790
speed 2lt

665
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,130
so these are some of the things that

666
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,320
that what actually capabilities mean and

667
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,480
then if you take new modems for example

668
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,909
like the ones which will come in smart

669
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,880
cars or like automated cars so they have

670
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,280
something like v2x capabilities so these

671
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,470
are actually defined in the in the modem

672
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,000
so these are designed and then defined

673
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,370
and then everything has a value so

674
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,270
whether it supports or doesn't support

675
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,979
like like

676
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,900
you see here like it has two different

677
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,530
capabilities like core network then

678
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,570
radio core network like basically you

679
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,250
can call what kind of like security

680
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,830
algorithms it supports so that it can

681
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,170
also support null algorithms which means

682
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,330
that all the keys are nothing but zero

683
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,130
so there are sometimes like the device

684
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,399
is using null encryption algorithm maybe

685
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,809
during emergency mode so yeah so if you

686
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,620
go a bit more detail like okay this

687
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:02,780
could be different kind of capabilities

688
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,300
it also supports for example if it's a

689
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,730
smart phone obviously it's supporting 3G

690
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,740
and 2g so if you look a bit detail like

691
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,990
this is nothing but a Wireshark trace so

692
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,500
it says like mobile station class mark 2

693
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:18,290
which says that the device supports 2g

694
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,390
or it supports like GPRS then mobile

695
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,330
session class mark 3 which mentions that

696
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,610
it supports like 3G and then you see

697
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,760
below it's something like voice domain

698
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:30,590
and you AUV you said setting so this is

699
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,870
something that's very specific to phones

700
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,959
because obviously we use phones to make

701
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,570
phone calls so that if you also like

702
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,040
find modems in vending machines they

703
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,080
obviously don't make any kind of like

704
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,850
phone calls so this kind of like

705
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,240
capability is actually disabled in

706
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:49,820
vending machines

707
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,760
so some 5g specific like v2x

708
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,860
capabilities then cellular IOT like

709
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,809
narrowband iot chips so these are

710
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,050
something which will come already in the

711
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:03,800
market but they will be a bit more like

712
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:05,210
you will find them more often like so so

713
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,220
these are some of the radio capabilities

714
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,110
like what kind of measurements it can do

715
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,600
what kind of like frequency bands then

716
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,659
RF parameters then something very

717
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,159
important is like the category if you

718
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,070
have like a high-end smartphone for

719
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,160
example like iPhone 10 obviously

720
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,919
normally the category is like cat 16

721
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,440
device if you have an iPhone 5 which is

722
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,780
like kind of very old this could be

723
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,970
called as like cat 6 device so the

724
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,580
higher the generation of the device then

725
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:38,270
the higher the category so these are

726
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,399
actually so normally when you turn on

727
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,440
your phone with the sim card so it tries

728
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,450
to register the network so basically

729
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,100
like when it's registering it's actually

730
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,200
sending all this capability

731
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:51,080
to the network so that network knows

732
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,270
what kind of device it is and then based

733
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,010
on that it can actually prepare the

734
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:57,410
service or like allocate the kind of

735
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,179
service for that so if we look there the

736
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,580
coordinator capabilities there are

737
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:04,730
actually sent to the network before

738
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,918
doing authentication so then that's okay

739
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,570
then we come down a bit like okay

740
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,100
authentication and security is done

741
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,559
between the device and the core network

742
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,659
and if you go down a little bit like

743
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,668
there is something called the radio

744
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,710
access capabilities if you look clearly

745
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,610
here like the radio access capabilities

746
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,030
are sent

747
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,610
prior to Oda security so Oda is nothing

748
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,370
but over-the-air so basically the

749
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,620
capabilities are sent in both cases like

750
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,408
prior to establishing some kind of

751
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,360
security there so this is what makes it

752
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,890
interesting for us so we thought we

753
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,080
could do some passive and active attacks

754
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,780
in this case and then this is the major

755
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,830
flaw so we started like look more what

756
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,149
can we do with these capabilities so we

757
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,520
came up with three types of attacks the

758
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,679
first one is like MN map then also some

759
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,299
bidding down attacks and something a

760
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,390
power drain attack that's especially

761
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:58,490
directed to I would devices so we built

762
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,659
a set up so we are or we were like

763
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,850
planning for some man-in-the-middle

764
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,740
attacks not only like just passive also

765
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,590
an active man in the middle so where we

766
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,500
need a bear a rogue base station plus

767
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,899
also a rogue iPhone so this rock base

768
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:15,440
station actually receives traffic from

769
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,710
victim phone and then forwards it using

770
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,400
effect FAQ V to the real network so you

771
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,400
are acting like a relay so we use two

772
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,169
software-defined radios and two laptops

773
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,510
obviously which are running different

774
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:32,570
base station and then phone software's

775
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,690
usually we use a software from SRS LT so

776
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,370
this is an open source cellular stack so

777
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,380
we try to use it but we have to

778
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,809
extensively modify them so that we have

779
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,090
the whole man-in-the-middle set up so

780
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,039
this was like right pretty complicated

781
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:49,309
to do but still somehow like we try to

782
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,110
achieve it and then we try to do some

783
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,299
attacks on with like real devices and

784
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,158
also like on the commercial networks but

785
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,750
I think we took like extensive care so

786
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,750
that we do not mess up with

787
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,350
like the first one I was setting the MN

788
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,300
map so we know the word like n map so

789
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,760
this is something very common in the

790
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,350
internet world so you use this tool to

791
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,270
actually find out live hosts on the

792
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,159
network and then what kind of ports are

793
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,870
open or what kind of services they are

794
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,340
running so this is what we are doing so

795
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,040
we thought we can do something similar

796
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,659
for the mobile networks so somebody puts

797
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,340
up a base station and then try to find

798
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,770
out what kind of devices are in the

799
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,169
surrounding like because like we will

800
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:31,010
have thousands of billions of devices

801
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,750
using modems so it's quite common that

802
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:35,550
we want to have this kind of tool like

803
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,130
so we call it like MN map like mobile

804
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,629
and map so what we are trying to do here

805
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,610
is like we are trying to find the maker

806
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,380
of this device and the model and the

807
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,500
operating system then what kind of

808
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,330
applications it's running then what kind

809
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,910
of versions they are using all based on

810
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,860
the capabilities that we try to

811
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:55,760
passively capture from the from the

812
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,110
phone or actively get it from the phone

813
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,440
so this is the kind of tree that we

814
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,240
built so first we actually start with

815
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,990
identifying the basement of the device

816
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,850
then the basement manufacturer like what

817
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,220
kind of model it is then whom actually

818
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,199
made this basement then if it's a

819
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,480
cellular baseband or if it's a cellular

820
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,800
I what he basement from if it's a

821
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,290
cellular device it could be either a

822
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,840
phone or some other device if it's a

823
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,970
phone then it's at Android or iOS then

824
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,000
if it's Android what kind of Android

825
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,580
phone like Samsung whoever and if it's

826
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,160
an iOS device it's an iPad or iPhone or

827
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,899
so then what kind of operating system

828
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,160
version it's running so we try to like

829
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,350
they'd use all this kind of information

830
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,660
from the capabilities that we received

831
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,520
and if you look the other side like if

832
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,530
it's a cellular device but it's another

833
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,900
kind of device it could be a car modem

834
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:49,230
or it could be a modem that's sitting in

835
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:53,220
a USB stick or in a laptop so we try to

836
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:54,690
find out all this information so you can

837
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,280
ask me like why is this identification

838
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,530
or like this kind of fingerprinting

839
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,480
possible because like normally these

840
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,100
capabilities are designed by the

841
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,910
baseband manufacturers for example i

842
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:08,159
qualcomm samsung mediatek huawei so so

843
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,599
they're like many manufactures like who

844
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,359
actually designed these capabilities

845
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:15,759
so it's not really mandatory to

846
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,708
implement all these capabilities so it's

847
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,659
optional to implement some of them and

848
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,579
to not to have some of them so some of

849
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:24,999
them can disable some bands some can

850
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:27,249
enable some can enable some features so

851
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:29,079
the thing is it is like basement vendors

852
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:31,209
implement these capabilities differently

853
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,549
so it's there is some kind of like scope

854
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:35,649
there to identify each of them based on

855
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:38,168
their implementations then the second

856
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:41,248
one is like each target applications

857
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:43,959
require enabling or disabling of certain

858
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:48,759
capabilities for example like if you

859
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:51,789
take a GPS GPS device a tracker so it

860
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:53,139
always needs this location feature on or

861
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,559
if you take like a smart car it needs

862
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:58,928
this v2x capabilities like activated or

863
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,039
phones they need always this voice voice

864
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:04,839
calling capabilities so so what we did

865
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,639
so before actually trying to identify

866
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,609
devices like we wanted to build a huge

867
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:11,619
model so we collected like maybe up to

868
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:16,208
80 different devices this includes like

869
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:19,389
laptops cars USB sticks routers some

870
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:21,249
devices from the military some other

871
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:24,069
special devices that are used in like

872
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:26,139
field testing so huge collection of

873
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:28,599
devices and try to get the capabilities

874
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:31,599
out of these devices so we collect we

875
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:35,158
attach them to our base station get the

876
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:38,319
capabilities and then prepare a model

877
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,269
and then when we save these capabilities

878
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,399
we also try to save it like who is the

879
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:43,989
baseband vendor then what's the

880
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,839
application it's running if it's a phone

881
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:49,269
we try to mark it as a phone then what

882
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:51,190
kind of like 3gpp standard released it's

883
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:54,759
running so we try to mark all this

884
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:57,219
information and then store him so so so

885
00:32:54,759 --> 00:33:00,339
once we have that we started to like

886
00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:02,559
find fingerprints of this inside these

887
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:04,389
capabilities so if we look clearly

888
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,859
because the first target was like trying

889
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:08,498
to identify who is the baseband

890
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:10,208
manufacturer so we found some specific

891
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:11,739
capabilities that are for example if we

892
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:14,109
take like e is zero

893
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:16,359
it's a null integrity algorithm and it's

894
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:19,208
always disabled in Qualcomm based

895
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:20,678
chipsets and then this the rest of the

896
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,959
manufactures like always have them

897
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:24,460
enabled I mean there's no specific

898
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,290
reasons like why

899
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,850
this is being done it's kind of like

900
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,010
optional to have this feature so some

901
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:33,219
might implement some might dynamically

902
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:35,800
enable this feature if you take like the

903
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,110
the extended measurement capability this

904
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,760
is always enabled in media tech based

905
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,979
chipsets then the rest of them just

906
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,379
disable it maybe they don't need it or

907
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,480
they're not using it so these are like

908
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,400
some something of prints that we found

909
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,740
that that that actually allow us to

910
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,330
identify the base band so once you know

911
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,360
like who is actually doing this basement

912
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,919
who is a maker of this base band then

913
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,310
you just go to the wiki and then find

914
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,110
out like who is exactly or which devices

915
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,090
are exactly like using this chipset

916
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:07,389
there are like so many chipsets you'll

917
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:09,880
find like Snapdragon 700 or or Kirin 980

918
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,340
from Huawei so there's a lot of

919
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,830
information there which gives you which

920
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:19,030
kind of devices are exactly using this

921
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:21,130
one so we are like halfway now we know

922
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,980
like the baseband model-makers and then

923
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,570
now the goal is to like identify the

924
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,449
right device and then the type of

925
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,490
application is running we could actually

926
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,469
separate easily between cellular and

927
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,389
then cellular IOT devices then

928
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,939
difference between phone and other

929
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,589
devices like I said voice and codec

930
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,170
capabilities are always enabled in

931
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,810
phones they are disabled in like USB

932
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:46,360
sticks laptops or any other kind of

933
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:49,150
devices that don't need call

934
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,040
capabilities then there are some some

935
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,730
tricks like always Huawei baseband

936
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,529
always use Huawei so this is like like

937
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,480
like they are paired like Samsung phones

938
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,400
always they could also use like welcome

939
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,080
basements but some specific welcome

940
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,600
phones always use like Samsung basement

941
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:08,710
and Apple they only stick to two of them

942
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,810
either Intel or welcome so we found it

943
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,010
was a bit tough trying to find out like

944
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,230
the difference between iOS and Android

945
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,020
so there are like certain GPS

946
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,060
capabilities that are always enabled in

947
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,410
Android but always disabled in jipner in

948
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:25,630
iOS and then some voiceover capabilities

949
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,399
which are always disabled in high voice

950
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,770
devices I mean we didn't go to the

951
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,010
render and then ask like why is it they

952
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,060
might come up with different reasons but

953
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,860
yeah we don't really want to care about

954
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,960
that so we just want some features that

955
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,320
that are like reliable so that we can

956
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,680
actually

957
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,980
differentiate between both of them in

958
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,990
certain cases like you might face

959
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,690
depending on the SIM card for example

960
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,390
like you plug in a SIM card that that

961
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,000
might trigger enabling or disabling of

962
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:58,240
some capabilities so SIM card could be a

963
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
trick tricky thing that that might give

964
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,549
you false results you have to be careful

965
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,530
with that or ordi if you because like

966
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,020
our list of devices like also include

967
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,430
devices from Korea China so the

968
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,440
implementation is slightly different

969
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,230
from there when you compared to Europe

970
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,930
so we try to make a huge model so that

971
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:20,440
we are not ending up with like false

972
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,799
results so what's next

973
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,390
obviously like we'll be surrounded with

974
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,280
billions of devices so it's actually fun

975
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,720
to actually identify what kind of

976
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,470
devices and what kind of like operating

977
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,910
system it's running and also like we

978
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,890
have some more techniques like to

979
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:38,680
actually identify the version of the

980
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,970
operating system but I'm not presenting

981
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,600
it here but like we can maybe we can

982
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:45,819
discuss offline and then we are actually

983
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,650
interested to share these traces or the

984
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,900
kind of like huge model we have and the

985
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:53,950
automated tool that people could use and

986
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:57,150
then try to play with it so so the

987
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,930
second one is bidding down attacks

988
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,730
basically this requires a

989
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,049
man-in-the-middle so we have seen like

990
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,060
different bidding down attacks like

991
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,670
previously in like bringing the user

992
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,920
from 4G to 2g just sending a message and

993
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,540
then it directly brings the user down to

994
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,640
to G so we tried something different

995
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:14,890
with these capabilities we actually like

996
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,020
hijack these capabilities so we saw that

997
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,150
the capabilities are sent prior to

998
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,430
establishing security so this is also a

999
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:26,620
kind of implementation that we saw in

1000
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:28,660
many operators so what we do is like we

1001
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,980
act as a man-in-the-middle relay so when

1002
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,109
the phone is sending the capabilities we

1003
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,570
try to modify some of the capabilities

1004
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,760
and then forward it to the network so in

1005
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,950
this case neither the device nor the

1006
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,810
core network has the ability to detect

1007
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,640
that the capabilities are modified

1008
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,910
because there is no security or kind of

1009
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,859
like integrity protection which is

1010
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:50,410
detecting this so that allows actually a

1011
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,940
success for the attacker so what exactly

1012
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,740
we are changing we

1013
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,900
so that on the right side like it's a

1014
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,029
trace from one of the test phones we

1015
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,039
have so if you look like the capability

1016
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:03,280
enquiry is done prior to establishing

1017
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:05,440
over there security which gives the the

1018
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,910
upper hand for that data so what exactly

1019
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,160
we are changing in the radio

1020
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,770
capabilities we are trying to modify the

1021
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,348
category of the device like if it's a

1022
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:17,200
cat wall or cat 16 device try to set it

1023
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:19,450
to cat 1 device so like what like I said

1024
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,279
cat 1 device is something like very low

1025
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,980
powered it's it's it actually represents

1026
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,960
an IOT device and we are also trying to

1027
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,240
disable some features like carrier

1028
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,609
aggregation or my mo because like these

1029
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,740
are essential to receive the speed on

1030
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:34,420
LTE network or else there's no I mean if

1031
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,890
there's if the if there are no such

1032
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,410
technologies like there is no difference

1033
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:41,200
between the GPRS phone and an LTE phone

1034
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,118
so these are essential

1035
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,270
then frequency bands obviously like when

1036
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,829
you are traveling may be different base

1037
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,380
stations support different frequency

1038
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:53,230
bands so it's important that the phone

1039
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:56,710
supports at least some bands maybe five

1040
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,089
six seven eight nine so but what we try

1041
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,789
to do we try to remove this bands

1042
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:02,950
telling the network that this device do

1043
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:05,260
not support maybe it supports only one

1044
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,720
band or one type of frequency that which

1045
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,240
we are operating now and try to remove

1046
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,368
the rest of the frequencies then we also

1047
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,558
remove the voice or LT which is the

1048
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:16,680
traditional way of making voice calls on

1049
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,089
LT there is also a fallback mechanism

1050
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,879
because if you receive this capabilities

1051
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:24,009
it means that the phone supports or if

1052
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,690
the phone has to make phone calls it has

1053
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,520
to go back to 2g and then make the phone

1054
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,230
calls so we try to remove all these

1055
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,970
capabilities and then send it to the

1056
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,980
network the network accepts it

1057
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,410
everything is great so the phone is

1058
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,180
actually connected now but the phone is

1059
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:39,098
actually connected now to the network

1060
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,710
like and I were to device it's not

1061
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:43,779
connected like a real iPhone or like so

1062
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,849
we try to do some tests with I think

1063
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:48,940
yeah that time was like iPhone 8 and

1064
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:50,890
then also some routers which are mostly

1065
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,869
based on crawl comes so it doesn't mean

1066
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,210
that these are only this is the problem

1067
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:56,230
in the specification so this affects any

1068
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:00,400
kind of baseband

1069
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,619
so the some of the results or the impact

1070
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,880
of this is like the data without the

1071
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:05,060
attacker the speed of the data

1072
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,250
connection was

1073
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,670
we're around like 48 Mbps I mean

1074
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:14,090
theoretically an iPhone 10 is supposed

1075
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:17,060
to receive speeds like 500 Mbps or even

1076
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,070
more but but practically like we don't

1077
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,440
see that speeds in commercial networks I

1078
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:23,930
think when we are playing in Germany

1079
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,420
like I think we saw 50 Mbps when it was

1080
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,770
like peak hours time so what we see

1081
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,720
after the attack is like the speed is

1082
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:32,480
reduced to MEP s it can also go down

1083
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,060
depending on on the amount of traffic

1084
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,890
that's there on the network so for voice

1085
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,560
or LD calls the device is being pushed

1086
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:41,690
to 2g it has to go back to 2g and then

1087
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,270
make the voice calls and then again it

1088
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:48,680
will come back to the network the LTE

1089
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:50,720
network so this is some of the effect of

1090
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,310
doing this so they're actually attaching

1091
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,990
a smart phone like and I want to device

1092
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,690
so you're actually killing the speed and

1093
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:59,810
some of the essential services that are

1094
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:02,270
actually supposed to receive on LT we

1095
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:04,400
tried on similar the same experiments on

1096
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,650
like 32 networks like different parts of

1097
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,050
the world and we see that this kind of

1098
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:11,930
behavior where capabilities are actually

1099
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,600
requested or or exchanged prior to

1100
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:16,970
security in 22 networks but the rest of

1101
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,620
the 10:10 networks are actually asking

1102
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,660
and asking for the capabilities after

1103
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,430
establishing the security so the

1104
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,890
attacker cannot actually modify if we

1105
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:27,640
even he modifies because there is kind

1106
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:30,859
of an integrity protection it will be

1107
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,370
detected by the network so there's a

1108
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,260
problem and the nice thing here is like

1109
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,900
the capabilities are actually stored on

1110
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,750
the core network for like seven days or

1111
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,430
until you restart your device so for all

1112
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,920
these seven days like the phone is

1113
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:47,560
acting like like and I were to device so

1114
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,390
even if you are travelling in the city

1115
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:54,740
you still don't receive the speed you

1116
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:56,870
want until you restart your device so

1117
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,700
why you might ask this like okay what

1118
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,410
what's the reason like why do you want

1119
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,419
to get the capabilities before security

1120
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,190
so this could be something for

1121
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,500
optimization purposes because like

1122
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,600
operators want to just check what kind

1123
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,700
of like radio capabilities the device is

1124
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,130
supporting based on that they want to

1125
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:16,939
optimize some radio features and then go

1126
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:18,440
for the security the third one was the

1127
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,860
battery gain attack which is actually

1128
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,720
dedicate

1129
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:25,490
for iwata devices so the same cell of

1130
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,959
attack we try to modify being a

1131
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,750
man-in-the-middle we try to modify the

1132
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,250
capabilities but if you look the maybe

1133
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:33,830
you must have heard in the market like

1134
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,080
okay the device operates on two Triple A

1135
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,130
sized batteries for like ten years so

1136
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,130
you don't need any kind of like

1137
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,870
attention for the device so these are

1138
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,240
something like natter by novelty devices

1139
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,430
so they have some feature called power

1140
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,189
saving mode so basically the device

1141
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,140
attaches to the network it says that it

1142
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:54,500
has this power saving capability and

1143
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,960
then it sends some bits and then it goes

1144
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,720
off actually the device is like

1145
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,160
literally off doing nothing so in this

1146
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,129
case being an attacker when you modify

1147
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,750
this this information telling that this

1148
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,550
device doesn't support any kind of like

1149
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,440
power saving mode so what happens in

1150
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,840
this case network thinks that this is a

1151
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,360
normal device and it wouldn't it

1152
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:16,100
wouldn't like send back the power of

1153
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,620
command to the device so basically the

1154
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,589
device is on for all the time and then

1155
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,600
it's actually draining battery and then

1156
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:25,250
maybe within like five days you can

1157
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,100
actually drain the whole battery because

1158
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,110
the device normally like the phone when

1159
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,360
it's on it's obviously like listening to

1160
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:35,150
neighboring cells like doing some power

1161
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,680
measurements so when it keeps doing all

1162
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,480
this stuff it's raining battery and then

1163
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,740
you're actually killing the device so

1164
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,810
have to restore from this it actually

1165
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,209
requires a restart because it has to do

1166
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:50,240
the attach again to the network and tell

1167
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:53,990
that it's actually an IOT device and not

1168
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,310
any other like like a phone so these are

1169
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,680
like some three type of that attacks

1170
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:01,250
like we tried on the 5g access protocols

1171
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,850
and the next one would be taken over on

1172
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:08,030
yes so this was the first type so this

1173
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:10,640
is basically and he mentioned most of

1174
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,830
time 4G or LTE because the point is we

1175
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,200
don't have the real network of pi G to

1176
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,450
play down but the standard documents

1177
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,490
which has been improvised from 4G to 5yi

1178
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,470
so these things hasn't changed at all so

1179
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,120
this is the same thing and what he

1180
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,129
mentioned about the IOT attacks I mean

1181
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,500
this has been informed to the 3gpp who

1182
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,030
designed the standards there were many

1183
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,710
operators also involved for the

1184
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,270
discussion and the discuss and they

1185
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,070
recognized this is the problem for

1186
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:36,050
some of the problems with IOT or some

1187
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:37,880
security issues and they will they have

1188
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,800
to fix it so it's in the standard but

1189
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,840
this will not come into the early

1190
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,940
version of 5g devices so this may take

1191
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,680
some time you you get it until to fix it

1192
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:50,650
so this was the first type you can

1193
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,970
exploit the unprotected data or

1194
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:56,240
unauthenticated data which is coming on

1195
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:58,759
the broadcast channel of mobile or IOT

1196
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,939
mobile and IOT devices now second thing

1197
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,600
is now after you still can exploit this

1198
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:09,370
one now we go next step further so this

1199
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:11,330
is basically exploiting little bit

1200
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,890
unprotected data but this is about

1201
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,390
authentication so this is not the radio

1202
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,339
but this is now we are going on layer

1203
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,930
three now so this is the mo information

1204
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,840
what you see on layer three so what has

1205
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,580
been no in the past we know that we know

1206
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,830
that the MC cursor works on identifying

1207
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,870
the mobile phone based on the MC MC

1208
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,610
means your SIM card has unique number

1209
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,170
and actually they recognized by you this

1210
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,870
number so this is what exactly you know

1211
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,550
and this is everybody knows how this

1212
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,560
seems to capture work in 2g 3G and 4G

1213
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:39,380
and I invite it will it will no longer

1214
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,940
work because your MC is no longer in in

1215
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,920
plain text so if it comes after the

1216
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,200
encryption is to using a PKI

1217
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,970
infrastructure and then is secured so no

1218
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,520
longer no longer passive encryption

1219
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:51,799
really work passive if she Cassidy will

1220
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,750
not work and we also had a problem with

1221
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,670
the challenge of the protocol they also

1222
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,530
been exploited so what exactly new we

1223
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,120
had so basically we exploit the

1224
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,160
authentication material which we

1225
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,080
received from the mobile operator and

1226
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,670
and partly with resynchronizing attack

1227
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,590
so this looks like a complicated I have

1228
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:09,110
a short print of a time but just to give

1229
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:11,120
a reference what exactly this is just to

1230
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,820
give a simple explanation if I start my

1231
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,440
phone now what happens my mobile phone

1232
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,750
send request to the tower let's that

1233
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,890
tele ice it sends request Italia

1234
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,050
this is the guy who wants to

1235
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,089
authenticate do you know this guy the

1236
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,990
tailor says ok this belongs to me this

1237
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,390
has my sim card

1238
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:28,640
so let's authenticate this guy so the

1239
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,009
Terrier sends two messages to two bits

1240
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,930
which is called our our four random

1241
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,670
number a for authentication tokens so

1242
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,830
two bits come from the network to this

1243
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,200
phone and this phone has to verify

1244
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,540
whether it has the correct aut n or not

1245
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,520
so endured some computation some magic

1246
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,410
don't ask me right now I ask later I

1247
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,090
wrote down time so after this checking

1248
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,430
says that okay this is the right guy so

1249
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,890
he can call now so what attacker needs

1250
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:54,710
to do for me I just need to record one

1251
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,480
time are an ardent aut and message only

1252
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,550
one time the lifetime of a mobile phone

1253
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,710
lifetime of mobile phone I just need a

1254
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,450
one message okay if I get this message

1255
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,640
that's enough so what I do me in the

1256
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,250
magic then I just need to replay this

1257
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,339
message anytime I want to track this guy

1258
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,200
in area so if I replay R and a UT n now

1259
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:15,080
I just explained a little bit math here

1260
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,810
for you so what exactly this a UT n is

1261
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,670
basically is called C into a Mac value

1262
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:23,180
let's assume C and Mac so what exactly

1263
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:25,040
this Mac basically is a function of some

1264
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,040
rare sequence number sequence number

1265
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,860
means whenever we send a new sequence

1266
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,810
number its it stores your sequence

1267
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,940
number like sequentially and it's like a

1268
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:36,920
nuns but it has been incremented by one

1269
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,690
value so they need to keep track what

1270
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,580
exactly the problem happened and then

1271
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:43,190
this c1 is equal to the sequence number

1272
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:45,650
XOR with a k so a K means what this is

1273
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:48,080
an almighty key so your sequence number

1274
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:50,000
is encrypted with anonymity key for

1275
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,220
example if you know the sequence number

1276
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,960
you know the right target for example

1277
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,370
alpha of spoon and my phone has a unique

1278
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,720
sequence number value which gets

1279
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,790
incremental every time my phone

1280
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,980
authenticates is like this simple nuns

1281
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,870
getting p metal by one so you need to

1282
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,360
protect this nuns the attacker should

1283
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:08,960
not be able to listen and if I come if I

1284
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,970
replay this RN a r RN a UT and two times

1285
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,580
what I get value basically because I

1286
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:16,160
replay the same value so basically I I

1287
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,170
will generate the same anonymity key a K

1288
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,930
star if you see on this blue and a K and

1289
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,570
a k these two values so what happens if

1290
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,029
I do a simple math of like like this a K

1291
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:28,010
and I replay the same value after like

1292
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,570
tomorrow to this mobile phone it's gonna

1293
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,920
give me sequence number two because

1294
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:33,050
sequence number has been used I use

1295
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,970
phone for a couple of times and but the

1296
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,860
a key will be same and if I just X or

1297
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,140
those two all you what I get sequence

1298
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,760
number one plus sequence number two so

1299
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,279
this is like a classical XOR problem in

1300
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,810
the design of a protocol that you just

1301
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,760
cancel the values and you get sequence

1302
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:48,620
number one and two so we did some kind

1303
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,060
of a computation and and try to find

1304
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,890
some formula can we recognize this

1305
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,650
sequence number value so we need some

1306
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:56,240
kind of a let us say 32 indication

1307
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,250
vectors which we can fetch from the

1308
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,370
operator and actually we can perform the

1309
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,890
computation and we learn

1310
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:04,380
the seven least bits of the sequence

1311
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,540
number so and this allows us to uniquely

1312
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,430
identify particular user because every

1313
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,020
user has a unique sequence so really I

1314
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:11,790
can really say that these phones belong

1315
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,800
to alta no matter where ever he goes

1316
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,690
because I can again denies this sequence

1317
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,790
number value this was the problem in the

1318
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,960
design of the protocol or Cryptologic we

1319
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,820
have seen from the standard Modi

1320
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,710
visually this allows us to identify

1321
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:24,570
certain user so this is still EMC

1322
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,760
catcher we are trying and locating but

1323
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,220
not based on the MC but exploiting the

1324
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,110
the design I mean the the Cryptologic on

1325
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,759
the protocol little bit complicated but

1326
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,920
still this is good for targeted attacks

1327
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,900
not for a muscle like a mass level

1328
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,910
passive attack so this is still classify

1329
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,790
as a targeted attack if your target is

1330
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:44,160
really known so all these attacks has

1331
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,440
been informed to 3gpp GSM a will they

1332
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,970
assign some cvd and they are about to

1333
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,140
fix some issues there is ongoing

1334
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,000
discussion going on because they

1335
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,770
mentioned this is targeted targeted

1336
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,910
attack so they give it lower priority

1337
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,950
because it doesn't need to be fixed

1338
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,870
right now but we will fix in future so

1339
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:03,480
maybe until it's some time or whatever

1340
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:05,190
it is yes and so we have a almost seven

1341
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,030
eight minutes so I will just somebody

1342
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:11,490
will covering that okay hope with the

1343
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:14,610
time we managed you to convey the

1344
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:16,410
problems what we look into but also I

1345
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:19,350
will end on this one element or note

1346
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,629
where there's a report from not of watch

1347
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,130
which talks about Phi G now this is what

1348
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,470
we talk about the radio problems because

1349
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:27,360
we are heavily looking from since last

1350
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,040
couple of years on radio side so we have

1351
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,560
pretty good expertise and we tell but we

1352
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,450
little look on the core network okay

1353
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,549
this is an explore area which we told me

1354
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,870
but now we are moving to as Phi G where

1355
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:39,420
everything is in virtual gonna be on a

1356
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:41,850
cloud network and people trying to see

1357
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,710
if IG as basically an emerging single

1358
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,870
intelligence platform for collecting and

1359
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,540
processing telemetry data even if you

1360
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:50,670
say encrypted with end-to-end devices I

1361
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,920
mean literally you can have a telemetry

1362
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:55,020
data which can still identify particular

1363
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,450
user or device or something like this

1364
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,980
and this is more critical to identify

1365
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,960
and that's what this makes more

1366
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,150
interesting the new transformation of

1367
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,980
moving towards the cloud adopting

1368
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,390
internet-based protocol to the core

1369
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,390
network of course it's a good product

1370
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:12,930
but there has to be a proper separation

1371
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:14,790
as well and on this end we in the talk

1372
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,230
and open for some questions I hope we

1373
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,089
have five minutes and we managed to

1374
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:26,640
finish

1375
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:28,380
thank you very much if the question

1376
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,690
comes or something we have this demo for

1377
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,400
a car to attack but I think we can

1378
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,470
explain your order offline we can show

1379
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,569
you if we don't have enough time so we

1380
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:38,220
can skip it yeah like five minutes I

1381
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:39,630
mean I people want to ask question

1382
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,098
I know there's a matter what questions I

1383
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,780
asked us I know as soon as we put this

1384
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:44,609
online on on YouTube

1385
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,400
the only question in the comments is

1386
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:48,779
gonna be like well isn't 5g just of mind

1387
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:54,450
control thing I heard it from a reliable

1388
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:58,880
source of a friend of mine okay nobody

1389
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:02,250
we have questions from the audience no

1390
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,470
do you want to show it okay so this is

1391
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,170
about the second attack what we did with

1392
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,700
the same card so how do you really

1393
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,170
calculate those values in basically so

1394
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,750
what we're doing is basically now how we

1395
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,450
track so here we don't need AMC as I

1396
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:17,430
explained so many people ask how do you

1397
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:20,790
really get MC but this was about the 4G

1398
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:22,710
how many people really use HL our lookup

1399
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,660
services HL our lookup services to

1400
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,400
anybody no actually in the past time

1401
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,529
when you just put mobile phone number

1402
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,809
into HLR lookup services it used to give

1403
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,190
you MC back and that's like enough to

1404
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:34,079
get all the authentication token of your

1405
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,640
target that's that's it game over so

1406
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,859
once you get the MC and then you just

1407
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,960
get all the authentication vector of any

1408
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:41,190
any user in the world I don't need to be

1409
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,990
in the proximity or anywhere you just

1410
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,880
get unlimited orientation tokens to

1411
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:47,339
compute the sequence number so this was

1412
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,290
the best way we are but nowadays every

1413
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:52,230
mobile operator is trying to reduce the

1414
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:56,700
access to this HL on lookup api's for

1415
00:52:52,230 --> 00:53:00,180
example so yeah so basically this is one

1416
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,740
way of getting it then we try to assume

1417
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,419
that you get the same seer identifier

1418
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,058
for example or some some things you can

1419
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,730
make you just by the me Chinese SIM card

1420
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:10,950
for example and you put that target

1421
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,890
number MC into the SIM card you

1422
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:16,770
reprogram it and off you go you have

1423
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,569
this now the missing card of your target

1424
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,390
now you just need to put this into your

1425
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:23,160
mobile phone and let's assume that you

1426
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:25,440
are doing this in Japan somewhere and

1427
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,670
you want it to target all tough now but

1428
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,050
now you need authentication to

1429
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,690
and so now this this guy is doing

1430
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,490
everything in Japan so he put this dummy

1431
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:33,780
SIM card in his phone in Japan and he's

1432
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,910
trying to say that I want to

1433
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,590
authenticate beyond formal table so what

1434
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,060
it happens he will not able to

1435
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,920
authenticate but he gonna get this

1436
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,529
random number and at authentication

1437
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,390
token thousand times No Limit anything

1438
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,970
so he will just collect all these tokens

1439
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,470
for n number of a time and that's what

1440
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,270
he just he need to collect those tokens

1441
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:53,609
to to able to compute the sequence

1442
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,410
number and when he comes too close to

1443
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:57,390
Altaf let's say in the proximity of two

1444
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,600
kilometer to track whether he is here or

1445
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,580
not

1446
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,290
so he just fired of his make base

1447
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,819
stations and and try to send this

1448
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,980
collected random number an

1449
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,720
authentication token to his phone trying

1450
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,090
to identify whether Altaf is here or not

1451
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,649
so he will just send those tokens in

1452
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,570
there for example and this is what now

1453
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:15,960
this fake mister tree is sending to the

1454
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:17,580
4G phone this is just to tell you if

1455
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,200
difference between Altaf spoon and

1456
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:21,330
Mattias for what exactly the difference

1457
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,540
between these two phone for example now

1458
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:26,430
we look at the data and it's it shows

1459
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:28,230
some unique parameters for example there

1460
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,609
so when matias phone is trying to

1461
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,680
connect our base station what happen

1462
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,330
actually we will see so authentication

1463
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,960
fails because we don't have any data

1464
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:39,360
about matheus phone and and basically we

1465
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,430
are we are already failed there so he's

1466
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,070
now injecting some more data to just see

1467
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:46,080
what we are response we get so what

1468
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:48,270
exactly happen is that it gives me a Mak

1469
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,580
failure MacNeill URI already says that

1470
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:52,140
this is not a replay data it says that

1471
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:54,270
this doesn't belong to Mattias at all

1472
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,200
this authentication vector so this is

1473
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:57,720
the wrong target

1474
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,609
but when altos will receive this token

1475
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,589
then we get a different error message

1476
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:04,040
and we will see this is also enough to

1477
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,480
recognize between two phones for example

1478
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,810
so now Altos phone will give a different

1479
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:14,210
response in this case so we are we are

1480
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:14,210
sending same data again 12 hours phone

1481
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:23,410
yeah now we are feeling again those

1482
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:27,400
authentication tokens aut NN ran and we

1483
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:28,899
get a response saying sync failure so

1484
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,150
it's the same mobile phone awful table

1485
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,770
but it's saying that the road this token

1486
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,810
has been replayed again that's what we

1487
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,460
have a sync failure now we need to

1488
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:38,620
synchronize that we need to avoid this

1489
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:40,510
replay and and that's what actually this

1490
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,009
phone is giving me it's passed request

1491
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,510
number which encrypted with and I'm

1492
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:45,220
going to key or something and that's

1493
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,200
enough for his response so he's one

1494
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,180
response is enough for me to calculate

1495
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,390
this sequence number for us for example

1496
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,950
and this is what then we do offline then

1497
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:57,009
we we have the algorithm which we

1498
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:59,310
designed and this is what exactly we

1499
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:02,080
identify with team based on this failure

1500
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:03,340
and again the range of attack would be

1501
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,770
different the way you design your

1502
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:07,300
antenna of course you want to cover find

1503
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:10,680
in Twitter or 2 kilometers the way you

1504
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,760
do for example and this is basically the

1505
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,490
response you have a sickness number and

1506
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,140
a cue and now we try to compute like

1507
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:19,000
this kind of friendly widget and this is

1508
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,220
pretty unique per user we tested many

1509
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,720
mobile phone many SIM cards of different

1510
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,700
European operators and actually will

1511
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,040
uniquely identify the user so this is

1512
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,680
what exactly tell the difference and and

1513
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,320
why this is unique for 5g because in YG

1514
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,419
this mechanism hasn't changed at all

1515
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,880
they added the public key encryption for

1516
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,950
protecting the MC but the underlying

1517
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,720
mechanism for authentication Mak fill

1518
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,029
your sink filler remains as it is this

1519
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,259
is common for 3G 4G and Phi G and that's

1520
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,930
what we say actually our attack is

1521
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,670
applicable for applicable for 3G 4G and

1522
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:55,779
5g techniques and 5g networks for

1523
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:57,400
example alright and that's it and this

1524
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,470
is the same for Phi G and this is also

1525
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,700
inform to the 3gpp body and I hope for

1526
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,959
this is being currently discussed

1527
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,000
whether if they should address or not

1528
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:08,320
for example we do have one question /

1529
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,790
yes yes you showed us the downgrade

1530
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,850
attack and you should ask a couple

1531
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:19,470
countries were tested and proved have

1532
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:19,470
you tried it in Sweden yes does it work

1533
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:25,420
so I wouldn't say like all of them are

1534
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:28,480
implementing the same way so there was a

1535
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,860
difference between I think two operators

1536
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,810
are doing in one way

1537
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:35,440
another way so like I said there's a

1538
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:36,880
difference in the sequence so yeah the

1539
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,910
same thing in Germany so one of them is

1540
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,270
following a good practice there's

1541
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:45,399
actually not a good practice so so but

1542
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:48,670
this is I think well inform to operators

1543
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,980
now so I another like how much effort it

1544
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:53,590
takes to actually correct this because

1545
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,270
like there are so we have this like two

1546
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,950
types either it's a configuration flaw

1547
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,950
or whether it's a direct implementation

1548
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:02,790
flock and it takes more effort I guess

1549
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:05,680
with the implementation to connect it or

1550
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:07,570
yeah I think we will check again after

1551
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,940
like six months and then just to see if

1552
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:15,040
things changed or not with GSM étude

1553
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,140
every operator and it's it's their

1554
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,450
decision to modify their settings and

1555
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,740
when we talk to few operators they were

1556
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,839
surprised what is this

1557
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,819
because they just rely blindly on the

1558
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,290
vendor of provider network they just

1559
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,180
have everything default running so they

1560
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:30,370
have no idea what's going on so there

1561
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,210
are some of it is like this so there's

1562
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,779
no idea what's going on there for them

1563
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:42,100
okay thanks

1564
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:45,460
Oh get a hand over there one question

1565
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:48,400
you mentioned that the 22 operators sent

1566
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:52,390
the capabilities in clear text and then

1567
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,430
10 had the security it turned on what is

1568
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,560
the rationale of having it turned on and

1569
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:58,660
he said an operator setting is our

1570
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,000
financial cost to having it turned on

1571
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,680
just trying to understand the reasoning

1572
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,530
and why having anything clear text

1573
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,540
versing it having it turn on I think I

1574
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:09,130
just answered this many operator doesn't

1575
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,410
know at all so they have no knowledge

1576
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:14,680
about this so there are very few good

1577
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:15,910
operators especially in Europe u.s. I

1578
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,359
can't say because we haven't done many

1579
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:20,500
testing in u.s. so they're the guys are

1580
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,270
good enough to understand the

1581
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,490
implication of this so they asked

1582
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:26,980
vendors to modify those things because

1583
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:29,140
they have the knowledge and this 22

1584
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,810
operators Asian and somewhere they have

1585
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:33,100
no knowledge about what's running what

1586
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,570
is the configuration of the network they

1587
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:37,690
have no idea that's what is running by

1588
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:39,820
default so maybe we told the GSM is a

1589
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,680
good practice that you you ask operator

1590
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,390
to check the default settings or give

1591
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,848
the guidelines what should be default so

1592
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,979
maybe there

1593
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:48,470
vendor like Erickson Nokia should give

1594
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:50,180
default enable so why disable but

1595
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:52,669
sometimes you need those reports from

1596
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,470
the mobile phone why it's crashing so

1597
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:55,849
you need those reports or why this has

1598
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,769
been behaving like this so you need

1599
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:59,539
those Yui capabilities or remeasurement

1600
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:01,249
report before as well so it's again

1601
00:59:59,539 --> 01:00:03,759
trade off the way they do for example in

1602
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:03,759
that regard

1603
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:12,960
initial questions more questions right

1604
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:18,908
Thank You Ravi Shankar

1605
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,909
