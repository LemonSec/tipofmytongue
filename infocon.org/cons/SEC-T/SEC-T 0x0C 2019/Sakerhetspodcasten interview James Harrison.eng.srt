to introduce you to our viewers okay and

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,989
listeners yeah you you start out as a

16
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,269
magician and slide it over into

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,420
pickpocketing yes how did that happen

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:55,330
well I I got into magic from the very

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,860
beginning for me was a lot later in life

20
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,900
than most people most people talk about

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,460
how they got all I got a magic kit for

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,070
Christmas and that's how I knew I'd

23
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,470
become a magician I'm like no before I

24
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,289
got into magic I was big into martial

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,719
arts multiple black belts and won

26
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:13,060
competitions the whole thing and I blew

27
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,059
my knee out and I was bedridden for six

28
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:21,520
months so I had a lot of free time on my

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:24,219
hands so I saw fall people David Blaine

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,408
on television sure and I was like I

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:28,798
always wanted to learn to do that let's

32
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:32,049
learn to do that so I started learning

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,090
got quite good at it because of the same

34
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,920
obsessive obsessiveness that you have

35
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,549
with martial arts I did with magic and

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,130
retranslated well and started performing

37
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,619
and all the rest of it and I just

38
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,109
gravitated towards the the pickpocketing

39
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,719
side of I liked magic that stuff would

40
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:51,788
appear in your pockets or disappear from

41
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,749
your person and appear somewhere else

42
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:59,139
so I would practice that and I found out

43
00:01:55,749 --> 00:02:01,329
that apparently pickpocketing is genetic

44
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:04,479
because of as I was watching a video on

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,219
how it worked back in the day great

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,840
French film called pickpocket if you

47
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,880
ever get a chance to watch it just for

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
watching the techniques it's amazing and

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,960
my dad watched it and said it was so

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,960
much easier back when I was a kid

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,910
what I think goes yeah I used to do this

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,180
in high school didn't I tell you that

53
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,630
and I'm like no no you did not really in

54
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,530
your blood

55
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:30,810
teach me I'll be one let's go and so

56
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,210
yeah apparently it's genetic the only

57
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,320
difference is I found a way to do it not

58
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,020
go to jail

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,209
yeah it's similar to hacking in that

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,860
sense like the IT security industry a

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,240
lot of people come from backgrounds or

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,970
at least an interest may have started

63
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,890
somewhere you know that's with

64
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,660
pickpocketing breaking into systems but

65
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,519
then figuring figuring out how to do it

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,020
legally mm-hmm well it's awesome I mean

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,390
doing something you love and getting

68
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,140
paid for it yes there's always a better

69
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,109
better vocation than doing something you

70
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,049
hate and just being miserable yeah so

71
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,740
but for me it's been a blast I've

72
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,709
enjoyed the conference and everyone's

73
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,769
really polite overly so well they're so

74
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,780
fairly sober I think that's well should

75
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,580
should be different tonight I imagine

76
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,290
that there's gonna be some people trying

77
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,390
to pick your pockets that's why I

78
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,060
brought this I actually brought dummy

79
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:34,470
phone referred for people to try cuz I

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,140
I'm well I did at Def Con I do a

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,780
workshop so people can feel what it's

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,850
like to do it cuz it to protect yourself

83
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,769
from it is one thing but that's like

84
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:49,079
sort of like I know self-defense by

85
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:51,540
punching a punching bag right you've

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
never been punched back oh well then you

87
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,450
don't really know then you don't really

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,980
know so it's the same with Vic pocketing

89
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,510
if you've never taken something out of

90
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,920
someone's pocket then you don't know

91
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,530
what it's really like so you don't know

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,630
what they'll feel for or looking for so

93
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,959
that's why I like doing the workshops

94
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,140
not so I have a rampant troop of

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,940
pickpockets under my name but for people

96
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,609
just to be able to understand like oh

97
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,620
that's what it's really like this is how

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,760
close someone has to really be yeah

99
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,770
because a lot of people tend to be

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,580
distracted or mystified with Hollywood

101
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,599
on on the romantic idea of how it works

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,560
and

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,660
it's it's much more down-and-dirty but

104
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,470
but that's that I mean you were talking

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,170
a lot about that

106
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,540
during your talk about getting into

107
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,900
someone's personal space yes and that is

108
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,020
the the major challenge and also to

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,090
distract them from from what you're

110
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,409
doing you you have to be a toucher yeah

111
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,340
you don't have to be you don't have to

112
00:04:52,410 --> 00:05:01,050
be creepy no handsy yeah but you you you

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,820
have to understand how to be within

114
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,650
someone's personal space and and

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,690
understand that you you will have to

116
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,359
touch them yeah and without making them

117
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,460
uncomfortable right and you you learn

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,140
that through interactions like you have

119
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,650
to be bad at something before you get

120
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,770
good at it and I've been caught I'm I'm

121
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,450
not gonna tell you I'm the superhero

122
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,450
pickpocket guy that I never get caught

123
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,370
it's I'm amazing no I I to this day I've

124
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,760
been doing it for 20 years I still have

125
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:37,170
people kind of catch me on stuff it's a

126
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:39,930
numbers game speaking of magic okay I

127
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,430
found that because I've been dabbling a

128
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,370
little bit with this sort of stuff as

129
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,810
well I'll be happy to see you do some

130
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,790
stuff at the Bark oh I haven't done it

131
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,070
for years oh but but I found that

132
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,480
because I could never get get very good

133
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,730
with like card trick so that kind of

134
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,520
right okay but I don't know it just

135
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,470
probably didn't have the the focus to

136
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,590
dedicate the energy to build that sort

137
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,090
of manual dexterity okay but on the

138
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,250
other hand one that one of the most

139
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,140
effective sort of tricks that I found

140
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,540
that you could do very easily especially

141
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,490
like in a bar setting is if you prepare

142
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,680
something and then reverse pickpocket

143
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,090
play something yes in someone's pocket

144
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,720
and then hours later use some you know

145
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,940
simple mentalism trick to whatever it is

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,950
like all right maybe coin disappear that

147
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,190
you've written something on or force

148
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,659
them to write the specific sentence or

149
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,480
something and you know you've already

150
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,330
prepared hours ahead of time yes I think

151
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,039
that in the park

152
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,349
yeah and then you know making that

153
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,180
disappear and then reappear in what fast

154
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:44,469
seemingly by magic in their pockets I

155
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,930
use I use that I use that I've only done

156
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,030
it a couple of times because the

157
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,069
circumstances were correct for it but I

158
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,878
have borrowed someone's wallet without

159
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:57,159
them knowing put yeah something in their

160
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,470
wallet that I have a duplicate of right

161
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:03,580
put it back in their pocket without them

162
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:09,520
knowing walk away come back do a trick

163
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:11,378
that does item vanish and say sir pull

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,680
out your pocket your wallet and I don't

165
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:16,659
say where exactly it is I don't go pull

166
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,060
the wallet out of your left pocket on

167
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,879
the on the back side of your pants like

168
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,620
no I just pull out your wallet and they

169
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,139
pull out the wallet and so open it up

170
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,719
what's inside and they're like holy cow

171
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,460
that thing that we just just saw

172
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,219
vanished and appeared in my dog near me

173
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,198
right and that's something that I sort

174
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:40,060
of a make mention in the talk is that

175
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,349
it's not I consider what the mythology

176
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,159
of pickpocketing is like a crime of

177
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:48,130
passion you have this thing I want this

178
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:53,190
thing I'm gonna take this thing yeah and

179
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:55,930
in reality it's no I I'm I'll hunt you

180
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,460
I'll follow you around for a while kind

181
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,159
of thing if I really want that thing

182
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,128
yeah but I'm gonna do Intel first I'm

183
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,020
gonna find out like oh that's where he

184
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,370
keeps it all the time it only comes out

185
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,318
when he's sitting at the table okay

186
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,690
great that gives me an opportunity to

187
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,090
make my job a little less hard

188
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,789
intelligence-gathering yes just like it

189
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,068
was hacking insecurity and breaching and

190
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,409
all of us or any like new do physical

191
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,360
engagements you do like a week's of

192
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:24,490
reconnaissance before you actually do

193
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,250
your endowment now with pickpocketing I

194
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,690
don't have weeks I have a day yeah a day

195
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,140
at most

196
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,929
maybe an hour because the more time

197
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,510
you're wasting on a person that's more

198
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:39,250
time that could have been spent stealing

199
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,599
something else that was easier yeah

200
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,910
right so it if it's a specific thing for

201
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,660
like penetration physical penetration

202
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,050
testing yeah

203
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,420
I have more time I have you know a

204
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,280
couple hours let's see what we can do

205
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,689
sure

206
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,600
find out where they go for restaurants

207
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:03,080
find out like where where do they hang

208
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,570
out bus stops whatever whatever multiple

209
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,630
people are at that gives me an

210
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,340
opportunity to sort of do an Intel which

211
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,380
should only take a couple minutes I find

212
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,960
out what you're doing right you pretty

213
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,180
much are on you know rinse repeat sure

214
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,430
until the bus shows up or while you're

215
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,260
sitting at the restaurant that at least

216
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,780
has given me enough information to go on

217
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,620
and like this is what I would use to do

218
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,040
this thing

219
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,090
yeah so that's one of the things I go

220
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,819
into great detail of the workshop that I

221
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:38,360
get asked to do is that I explain for

222
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,190
people to get an understanding of it is

223
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,750
a lot of people go to restaurants

224
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,220
they'll put their cell phones on the

225
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,210
table because they don't want to Bent in

226
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,290
their pocket if I can find a way to put

227
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,330
something on top of said phone and then

228
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,880
say I have to leave and pick up said

229
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,250
thing and the phone that's still

230
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,720
pickpocketing it's not as glamorous as

231
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,620
me reaching in a pocket without you

232
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:08,150
feeling it sure but that still happens

233
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:08,930
and your the end results exactly the

234
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,730
result is the same

235
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,859
exactly and that's all that matters yeah

236
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,920
but it's it's still sleight of hand

237
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,020
right it's still understanding direction

238
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,280
of attention yeah and it works under the

239
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,110
same guys it's just our pockets are now

240
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,350
further away from us sure so to speak

241
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,810
it's like you you were explaining about

242
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:34,490
pickpocketing a woman is usually easier

243
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:38,180
because they're genuinely yes most women

244
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:42,770
will have a purse or a handbag of some

245
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:46,189
sort and if I want to make my life super

246
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:48,050
simple you know and wait for them to

247
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,700
open up that purse like they'll pull the

248
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,219
zipper open for them and if they're in

249
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,100
the rush they'll leave it open yeah

250
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,010
now I've noticed that while waiting in

251
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,260
lines I've seen women literally see me

252
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,120
I'm not a small person by any means

253
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,600
but if I'm standing beside them I've

254
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,360
seen them literally a person close

255
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,399
without even seeing me do anything it's

256
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,959
just because I didn't stick by instinct

257
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,450
those zip it up because they realize

258
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,160
that's happened but if I do my job right

259
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,899
they don't know I'm behind them in the

260
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,240
first place that purse is wide open

261
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,850
there's a cellphone there's a wallet

262
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,700
that's it I look at it as the equivalent

263
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,220
of those machines the the drop down the

264
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,779
hook yeah pick up the stuff ease yeah so

265
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,839
what their purse is like whatever

266
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,730
whatever's lusus is coming out so it's

267
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,459
like an amusement park yeah a little bit

268
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,350
that's probably on the easier scale of

269
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:43,459
things yes so you say are some of the

270
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,200
harder items harder items with locations

271
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:52,489
harder locations

272
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I find honestly the back pocket back

273
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,510
pocket and an over fitted wallet usually

274
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,350
in North America it's called a Costanza

275
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,180
wallet George Costanza from Seinfeld he

276
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,970
pulled out his wallet it was like big

277
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,099
sandwich of a thing that he keeps in his

278
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,660
back pocket and we we jokingly call

279
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,190
people that have those kind of wallets a

280
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,290
Costanza wallet that I can't get I

281
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,630
wouldn't even bother trying it's just

282
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,149
stuck in that guy's pot back pocket I'm

283
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,439
not gonna bother front pockets are

284
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,959
actually easier especially with cell

285
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,660
phones a lot of people have cell phones

286
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,459
and the cases that they have unless it's

287
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,469
in like an otterbox which is just full

288
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,089
on rubber sure they're still nice and

289
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,750
smooth and they slide right out of

290
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:42,560
pockets like cargo pockets I mean um I

291
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,089
find well in this case your cargo

292
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,099
pockets not so much because you have

293
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,600
this nice zipper that goes across but a

294
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,329
lot of pockets they just have the two

295
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,420
buttons and if you put too much stuff in

296
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:57,529
a pocket the pocket sends the bow open

297
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,630
mm-hmm and it's just a night it's like a

298
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,890
it's like a purse for a man

299
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,530
things pop out of that pocket because

300
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,330
it's just open now because there you're

301
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,530
not supposed to put a lot of stuff in

302
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,480
those pockets that's just for

303
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,270
convenience more than anything sure but

304
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,460
people put like four or five different

305
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,730
items in there because it's just open

306
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,410
space that's not affecting my waist so

307
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,450
that's what they do with it and I find

308
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,040
that because of that weight it opens up

309
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,960
the bottom part of the pocket so I don't

310
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,900
even have to bother with the buttons so

311
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:32,700
I can just put my two fingers in go

312
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,829
huntin yep well yeah another part of

313
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,410
your talk that fascinated me as well was

314
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,790
I think it was actually it's just a

315
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,469
question at the end but when you got

316
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,240
into talking about the booster bags like

317
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:47,190
how about stealing a bag and for for our

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,190
audience maybe you can describe what

319
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:53,430
that is and what are there's a mother um

320
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,190
well a booster bag is what on the

321
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:59,400
outside is a normal bag it could look

322
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:03,750
like a doctor's bag or a gym bag but the

323
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:07,620
inside is designed to go over top of

324
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:11,010
another bag and use essentially like a

325
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:14,010
gravity weight that it when it pushes on

326
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,620
it the weight of it being pushed onto it

327
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,140
keeps it in the bag and you are able to

328
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,020
lift your bag and their bag inside the

329
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:36,120
bag underneath and that allows it to go

330
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:38,790
with it and walk with it yes um under

331
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,320
security sense yes I would need more

332
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,890
Intel because I need to get this

333
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,140
specific thing if I'm doing like a

334
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,569
penetration of physical items and stuff

335
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,130
like that and I want to get that that

336
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,290
guy's suitcase or whatever that access

337
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,750
card that's in the back and if you're a

338
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,640
pickpocket and just going for something

339
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,140
out of opportunity then I just need the

340
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,300
one bag and I'm looking for everything

341
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:05,090
that fits everything that looks like a

342
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:07,250
nail for my hand yeah so so

343
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,260
what are some other tools that I mean

344
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,520
why don't use one one tool that I've

345
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,230
always been fascinated with and

346
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,990
unfortunately I live in a country that

347
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:19,220
switch blades are illegal so I gets to

348
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:20,780
have one but a it's a switchblade but

349
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,590
what they've done is they've grounded

350
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:26,510
down the blade into a hook so the back

351
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,110
end of it the very tip of it starts to

352
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:33,380
curve in right and they use that hook to

353
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:36,260
slice open bottoms of purses and backs

354
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,080
pockets where the wallet is so although

355
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,569
it's razor sharp they just have to touch

356
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,190
it and do that and you can still check

357
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,540
your pocket and like nope my wallets

358
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,070
good he didn't get anything even though

359
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,170
you felt it doesn't matter

360
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,610
yeah because now all he's gonna do is

361
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,089
he's gonna follow you until with drugs

362
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:55,880
yeah until that hits the floor five ten

363
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,100
minutes I wait if nothing falls on to

364
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:07,220
the next person and someone else can get

365
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:08,780
it right yeah but now but now I've

366
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,150
noticed that they're trying to sell

367
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:19,490
these pants that can't be cut I'm very

368
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:22,370
disappointed in that that is something

369
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,780
that is usually bad it's usually bad and

370
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:29,120
that's why you have that in the hook

371
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,220
right and as funny as it would be on on

372
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,440
stage I think a lot of people would

373
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,180
probably find that a little at least the

374
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,220
person on stage would find that a little

375
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,410
disappointing that that about yeah I'd

376
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,560
have to be offering pants at every

377
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,430
performance which I mean a bad idea

378
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,930
you have my branding on the line but I'm

379
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,930
stepping on this stage you accept the

380
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:53,630
risk of going home no one no one's gonna

381
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:56,060
come to my shows then

382
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,370
you know using this using your

383
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,979
techniques in in a physical engagement

384
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,779
because there are some some of the

385
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,780
things that you were mentioning on stage

386
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:09,439
that would that I directly could could

387
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,899
translate into usable techniques when it

388
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,829
comes to trying to swipe someone's cards

389
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,110
right distracting them from from from

390
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:21,938
their lanyards right they're carrying

391
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:25,159
around their their necks and so on so

392
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:28,820
have you been being contracted for doing

393
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:32,270
like physically engagements like not as

394
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,620
of yet I'm I didn't honestly I didn't

395
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,080
know this was a thing until this year

396
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,389
actually that that that was an actual

397
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,010
vocation as I found that out at Def Con

398
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,840
and listening to the darknet diaries I

399
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,970
found out that that was an actual

400
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,379
vocation and I'm like I've been doing

401
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,230
that for years you're telling me I can

402
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,539
get paid to do that yeah oh yeah I used

403
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,390
to love I haven't paid for convention in

404
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,830
like ten years

405
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:02,210
you can also another good scam is

406
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:05,928
running a podcast yeah I'll have to look

407
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:10,640
into that but yeah I mean combining that

408
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:14,770
in with with lock-picking as well yes I

409
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,770
find lock-picking very fascinating

410
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:25,850
that's you know it's funny how these

411
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:27,380
kinds of interests even if we work with

412
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,059
computers every day there's a lot of

413
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,919
overlap but people are interested in

414
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:35,690
lock-picking or pickpocketing or

415
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:39,860
also social engineer what you do I have

416
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:42,049
to done you right I have to I was we

417
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,428
were talking to some ladies after my

418
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,250
performance they were asking questions

419
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:49,100
like how do you get into people's

420
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,890
personal space and how do I do it

421
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,139
because I'm not you and I'm like well

422
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,730
first off your lady so you you are

423
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,139
probably gonna be able to get into more

424
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,479
personal space than I can

425
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:03,718
so I have to be more charming and less

426
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:07,099
threatening because I'm a fairly large

427
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:12,119
guy I'm not as big as some people but

428
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:15,269
I'm a fairly big guy and I have to dumb

429
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:19,379
that down for me to be able to go into

430
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:21,479
people's personal space and not if not

431
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:24,658
becoming effeminate but like like

432
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:30,409
mascots do for little children like

433
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:33,409
they're there and yeah just just be less

434
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:36,899
intimidating more severe unless you know

435
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:41,099
yes and in doing so that allows me to

436
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:43,080
get into personal space and be that

437
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:46,499
social engineering kind of thing allows

438
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,168
me to as being the dumb foreigner like

439
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:52,019
oh I'm so sorry I am terrible I don't

440
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:53,940
know what I'm doing and in doing so I've

441
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:55,619
already got my hand on you it's not a

442
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,399
big thing because that's an okay thing

443
00:19:55,619 --> 00:20:01,978
I'm needing help when you need help

444
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:06,119
you touch someone like please help me

445
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:08,099
yeah and and I pray on well not in a

446
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,109
literal sense I don't do that a real but

447
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,509
you would use that to prey on people

448
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:15,330
sure you're taking something that is in

449
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,909
everyone and our nature is you want to

450
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,189
help people you really do and if you can

451
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:22,619
if you can help people it makes you feel

452
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,809
good because you help someone step up in

453
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,339
their life sure unfortunately there are

454
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:30,178
people out there that take advantage of

455
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:33,599
that and pickpocketing is one of them

456
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:36,479
right so another question that just

457
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,879
struck me was the demonstrations that

458
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,889
you give onstage we're obviously

459
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,478
standing up for disabled or something

460
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:44,488
like that but would you ever do

461
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:47,309
pickpocketing sitting down like for

462
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:49,889
example like we are seeing now there are

463
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,369
techniques for for stealing stuff when

464
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:54,629
people are sitting there is actually a

465
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,968
pickpocket that was well known for that

466
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:59,539
his name was Mark raffles a great

467
00:20:56,969 --> 00:21:02,279
pickpocket and I believe he's British I

468
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:05,249
apologize I'm still running on very

469
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:08,399
little sleep from flying here but Mark

470
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:11,519
raffles used to pickpockets sitting down

471
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,498
and he was great at it he could this guy

472
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,570
lifts everything and anything anything

473
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:18,720
that wasn't nailed down the guy would

474
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:20,220
get and he would do it with two people

475
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,690
one person sitting on one side of the

476
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,029
table the other person sitting on the

477
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,159
other side of the table and while he was

478
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:29,340
stealing things he'd put things in your

479
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:34,529
face and he's very actively disruptive

480
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:37,649
actively distracting you myself I'm I'm

481
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:39,629
a little more low-key I don't know I'm

482
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:41,580
sure it translated very well when I was

483
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:45,899
standing on stage but I'm a big believer

484
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,239
of minimalist movement if I don't have

485
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:49,668
to waste movement doing something I

486
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:51,690
won't sure

487
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:53,789
so if I'm gonna take something out your

488
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,549
pocket I'm gonna try and go the most

489
00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:02,429
direct route I can and that's me being

490
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:05,609
funny and genuine but also trying to

491
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:09,840
make sure that you're gonna do what I

492
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:13,918
want make sense well I have to be in

493
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,580
charge I mean it's just not only does it

494
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,389
help my OCD but what else well still

495
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:25,470
having your mark yes that is that is key

496
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:28,320
if you've if anyone feels that they are

497
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:30,389
in charge they are far more relaxed you

498
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,849
sure because they feel like there's

499
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:34,949
nothing this person can do because I'm

500
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:36,479
in charge I am in control of the

501
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,330
situation so you lower your threat

502
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:40,470
levels and you uh I hate saying it like

503
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,330
that though I got to come up with a

504
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,249
better word cuz saying threat levels is

505
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:48,059
like instead of I got a knife I just

506
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:54,570
have a spork I think I need a better

507
00:22:48,059 --> 00:23:00,599
word than threat levels but yeah it's

508
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:02,879
just that that it's a good word for it

509
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:07,200
you just your your awareness level yeah

510
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:09,029
if I can lower that and you're on you're

511
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,519
no longer on red alert then I have a

512
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:15,809
greater opportunity to to borrow things

513
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:18,809
then say if I'm coming off as aggressive

514
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:21,629
in everything but that sometimes changes

515
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:23,730
I found that I have to be

516
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,290
aggressive with certain people because

517
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,270
it's the only way they'll shut up and

518
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,350
let me do my job and I imagine that

519
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,490
people respond differently I mean yeah

520
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,780
not everyone's the same but that being

521
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:41,100
said we're not all lanique snowflakes I

522
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:44,970
mean one of the things that you you got

523
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,560
asked the question and I believe you

524
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,960
reply with something like I wouldn't I

525
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,870
would be very aggressive or something

526
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,970
like if I have to be yeah if I have to

527
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,360
be yes and that wouldn't look nice on

528
00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:01,230
stage of course no it's I'm and routine

529
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,909
yeah I don't want to do that doing this

530
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,870
yeah I don't want to do that on stage

531
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,850
because that's that's not what is it'll

532
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,500
be entertaining for some I won't be

533
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,760
entertaining for all and it certainly

534
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,340
won't be entertaining for the nice

535
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,920
person that decided to come up and not

536
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:21,090
as you saw in the talk I asked the

537
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:26,010
gentleman in the front and he his face

538
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:27,959
went white yeah that's what his

539
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,480
immediate reaction was and I'm like okay

540
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,800
we're gonna let this bounce off him to

541
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,470
the other guy cuz the other guy behind

542
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,129
him was like me yeah and I'm like

543
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:40,590
perfect yes do you yeah let's get you up

544
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,300
here but the other guy honestly I scoped

545
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,159
him out he had a cell phone he had a

546
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,360
wallet he had a watch think he had a

547
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,420
couple other items I would have been

548
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,120
able to borrow more things on stage but

549
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,700
I took who I could get because I don't

550
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,899
want to have I don't want to get

551
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,960
manhandle II if that's a word but it is

552
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,520
where I'm I've seen older pickpockets at

553
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,740
least theatrical pickpockets where

554
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,340
they're very aggressive and removing the

555
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,230
person I don't know a huge fan of that I

556
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,810
find that that that allows them to

557
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:17,280
remember the moment it happened more

558
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:19,379
later on yeah if they can pinpoint oh

559
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,350
this this this is when it happened he

560
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,390
was pushing me and moving me around and

561
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,580
all the rest of this stuff that's when

562
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:30,300
they can trace it back but if you can be

563
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,480
a little more gentle I guess is the

564
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,860
right word or more less less aggressive

565
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,240
I guess it would be a better word like

566
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,490
I still have to be in charge I still

567
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,260
have to put you in the right position

568
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,140
but if I'm not on the way that you might

569
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,210
remember specifically exactly if you can

570
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,160
pinpoint certain spots then you can go

571
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:55,320
back and go that's what he did dan was

572
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,660
in the Dan was Dan was John chomping on

573
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,280
the bit to come up and I'm happy was cuz

574
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,710
it made my life easier I don't know

575
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,730
where Anderson went I was he was

576
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,350
supposed to come up because he had the

577
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,549
jacket and I can go find the stuff and

578
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,750
then he showed up halfway through the

579
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:08,280
show and I'm like well it's too late now

580
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,840
I've already got Dan up here well

581
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,899
thankfully Dan was a great sport to come

582
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:19,860
up and yeah yeah and those his was a

583
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,169
unique one the lock ones and the only

584
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,020
reason I used him is because he had one

585
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:27,240
but I wouldn't go after his because he

586
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,299
has that weird twist-locking thing but

587
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,460
in actual sense if Dan is busy doing

588
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,889
something I can take my time and

589
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,510
actually twist it and open it and

590
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,830
everything I might even if you know that

591
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,260
you're out going after that sort of

592
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,899
items and then you would take the time

593
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,910
to practice to do it learn how to do it

594
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:57,179
with probably one hand the big secret of

595
00:26:44,910 --> 00:27:02,280
the magic they have to because the other

596
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:04,980
hands working with something and that's

597
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,980
they are safe they will never fall off

598
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,470
deliberately but they do make it way

599
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,950
easier for a person like myself to just

600
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,580
pinch the intern and it's it's off it's

601
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,230
easy to go and it's the same with Lane

602
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,620
years a lot of land use tend to have

603
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,970
that nice little pinch yeah not so much

604
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,290
the ones that they have here at this

605
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,120
conference where you have to pull a

606
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,149
lever and open it they usually have a

607
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,699
little tension spring yeah where you

608
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,380
just squeeze it and if you can get close

609
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,160
enough to squeeze that and it's just a

610
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,780
quick lift and off yeah and it's it's

611
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,669
fun cuz a lot of people are like oh you

612
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,330
can you get one of these off and I'm

613
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:47,070
like yeah but not right now not right

614
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,730
now because you deliberately came up and

615
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,820
asked

616
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,750
you're gonna see everything now yeah but

617
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,210
it's it's an opportunistic skill my

618
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,519
friend in England his name's James Brown

619
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:05,370
he put out a book called the he calls

620
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:08,730
himself the opportunist yes that's a

621
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:12,330
funny thing but he is he is a pickpocket

622
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,340
and and hypnotist in england which i

623
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,899
think is really the real reason he's

624
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,730
able to get away with pickpocketing is

625
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:22,350
he just hypnotizes i'm ahead of time and

626
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:25,049
steal stuff but he he uses that kind of

627
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,230
stuff where it's just he's brilliant at

628
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:29,639
it

629
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:33,870
and he works with just fun little stuff

630
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:35,639
like that so yeah all right ma'am thank
