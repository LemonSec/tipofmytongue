1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:12,580
all right so yeah my talk is on how to

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,410
pick pockets as you can see there are

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,050
some empty seats clearly they didn't

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,820
want me to find anything that's in there

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:24,880
so for me to be able to do what I do

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,679
I need someone else's pockets so I've

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,839
been wandering around seeing who would

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:33,100
be nice enough to come and help and the

9
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,629
answer is from all your faces no one so

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,760
we'll see what we can do when I ask

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:42,690
people to just come up here like this

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:45,040
gentleman what is your name oh yes you

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,140
seeing as though he just looked at me

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,690
like a deer in headlights what is your

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,240
name sir Mike would you be nice enough

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:57,250
to come and help me for one moment give

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,770
Mike a round of applause thank you hello

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,769
Mike I'm gonna be on this side for one

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,390
second and we're gonna get the cameraman

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,770
to help out on this point because we're

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,720
gonna do a little bit of close-up magic

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,750
that hopefully you will be able to see

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,200
on stage on the cameras and then we'll

24
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,060
do it with you okay it is just a trick

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,650
with my ring if you don't mind taking a

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,300
look and also if you don't mind you'll

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,940
notice while I'm doing this trick I pull

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:26,110
my sleeves back no one trusts me I don't

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,440
trust you pull those bad boys back all

30
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,450
right

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,350
so normal ring aside from the fact that

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,550
it is just a very large ring but normal

33
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,990
nonetheless because in a moment I'm

34
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,789
gonna frustrate everybody here so if

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,610
we've come in a little close to the hand

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,430
here perfect how we doing perfect

37
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,970
please watch close as we take that off

38
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:48,180
and throw it back on ya gets weirder

39
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,179

doing this silly dumb thing right yeah

46
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,460
when you get better at it

47
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,820
make sure the cameras got it okay right

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,130
there just like that

49
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,209

your hand open for me excellent I'm

53
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,350

54
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,230
squeeze it tight turn your hand over but

55
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,570

63
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,390
some of these are bad jokes ok but if I

64
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,670
take the ring and I make it go did you

65
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,458

74
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,390
that there I don't want to play with

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,959

88
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:56,230

97
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,488

98
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,799
I mean assistant that I was going to

99
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,450

100
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,700

101
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,080
some stuff thank you sir

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:32,260
give Dan a big round of applause thank

103
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:35,680
you Dan I appreciate it so make my

104
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,909
demonstration so much easier so why do

105
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
we worry about this

106
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,780
why obvious for obvious immediate

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,730
reasons I don't want to lose money I

108
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,169
don't want to lose my identification I

109
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,390
don't want to lose the fancy watch I

110
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:52,180
just bought don't show off for my

111
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:54,099
friends I get that but also theirs IDs

112
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,919
that people need to get into their

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,050
security locations lanyards and ID

114
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,299
badges that hang off clothes that I love

115
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,830
so much and makes my job easy because

116
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,480
you guys are far more impressed with the

117
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,490
fact that I stole something that allows

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,100
you to get into the hittite security and

119
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,100
all I did was squeeze an alligator clip

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,830
I'm just glad I get paid for it

121
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,960
so we're gonna demonstrate with Dan on

122
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,460
his pockets so I apologize den you're

123
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,310
not gonna get to see the audience you're

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:28,590
gonna turn around and everyone gets to

125
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,820
see the better side of Dan okay now Dan

126
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,260
we're gonna go after the wallet here

127
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,710
just so everyone can kind of see what

128
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,750
we're doing here it doesn't matter what

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,789
kind of distraction is being used as

130
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,640
long as there is something to divvy up

131
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:47,559
Dan's attention that's important so what

132
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,299
we're gonna do is simply this

133
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:52,629
we're gonna go over the mechanics of how

134
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:54,789
this works so you get an idea of exactly

135
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:57,669
what's happening and then we'll explain

136
00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:00,729
how I am a stranger able to get close

137
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:04,839
enough to you to actually do this okay

138
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:08,279
and the mechanics side is very simple we

139
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:10,599
use two fingers to start three to finish

140
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:13,199
I'll show you what I mean you can watch

141
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:17,049
on the camera here two fingers to start

142
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:21,129
thumb goes in finger goes in I separate

143
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:23,679
it from his butt so he's not going to

144
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:28,439
feel this part so much and then the

145
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:30,638
third finger helps clip it like so and I

146
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:33,639
noticed there's a bit of friction there

147
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,059
so I have to make Dan move to not feel

148
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:41,769
the friction I can ask him simply to say

149
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:44,229
please walk forward and in that action

150
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:46,389
he walks out of walks the wallet out of

151
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:50,639
the pocket well put it back for one

152
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,899
second my personal favorite is this one

153
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,679
it's just me being a little belligerent

154
00:06:52,899 --> 00:07:00,459
and kicking his foot step forward it's a

155
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:05,090
little belligerent

156
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:09,230
it's a little rude but I'm used to it

157
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,969
and that's really all it is now under

158
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,110
this guy's here we're just going to put

159
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,320
this back down and then we'll have you

160
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,430
turn back around so now you understand

161
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,790
that the techniques aren't that

162
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:23,030
difficult you have to be courageous

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,560
enough to do this but as long as you

164
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,229
understand the techniques the techniques

165
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,500
are simple it's applying them that's

166
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:34,580
hard because here's a great example Dan

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,110
stand there face me aside from the fact

168
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,180
that I'm almost a head taller than you

169
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:47,900
and almost is almost just as wide

170
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:49,760
meaning I'm a big boy yes here's here's

171
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,750
the interesting thing I have a feeling

172
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,630
that if I walk into your personal space

173
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,490
you're gonna let me know it especially

174
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,020
if you don't know me so if I walk like

175
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:11,030
this towards you let me know when this

176
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:13,789
is uncomfortable everyone feels this way

177
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,330
unless you know there's some social

178
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:20,000
interactions that we forgotten but this

179
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,500
is bad for reasons you don't want people

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,240
in that personal space unless you know

181
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,800
them because if you don't know them you

182
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,930
don't know what they're going to do and

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,630
as a more caveman way of looking at it

184
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,150
they're very important vital things here

185
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:39,260
I don't want near the end near these

186
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:42,549
things and all my valuables tend to be

187
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:46,250
near these things so we don't want

188
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:51,020
anyone near that so I have to get past

189
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:53,120
that now there is a great talk by a

190
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,980
master pickpocket named Apollo Robbins

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,680
he talks about this in great detail in

192
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,360
the science of it I unfortunately don't

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,949
describe it his way I describe it in a

194
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,920
way that I'm more comfortable with and

195
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:11,959
that is just the alpha male mentality

196
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,689
it's that eye contact thing if I'm

197
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,729
making eye contact with Dan dan doesn't

198
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,269
want to break eye contact one of us is

199
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,600
going to give eventually

200
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,100
so I let him I let him win and this is

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,559
the fun part about it when I let dance

202
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,779
iContact win he feels he's now in charge

203
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:37,279
and that allows me to get closer because

204
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:39,499
his confidence is up I'll explain so

205
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,899
when I walk towards Dan I break eye

206
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:45,379
contact I shrink just a little bit and

207
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:52,100
now I'm in his personal space and he

208
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:54,649
feels like he's in charge okay he's not

209
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,179
but I want him to feel that way because

210
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:57,980
I want to be able to get into your I

211
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,649
want to be able to get into his personal

212
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,999
space to do my job which is take his

213
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:07,459
stuff I need to distract him now magic

214
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:09,379
is a great distraction it's what I use

215
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,618
all the time to mainly entertain people

216
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:15,519
and have fun with it while I steal your

217
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:17,720
phone your wallet and your watch but you

218
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,609
don't get to do magic tricks in the

219
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:27,579
security sense luckily everyone here has

220
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:27,579
the perfect distraction in their pocket

221
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,189
and all I do is this Dan I am so new

222
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:43,819
here could you help me find this place

223
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:50,390
I'm trying to look for and he will look

224
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:52,970
on my phone it's my phone it's my phone

225
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,100
so I am perfectly allowed within my

226
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:58,220
rights to come up nice and close to Dan

227
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:01,070
to look at my phone well I don't need to

228
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,959
do that part that's messy but while

229
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,209
you're looking at said phone trying to

230
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,709
navigate whatever it is that's what

231
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:09,680
allows me to get in nice and close and

232
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,050
try and take things so if I'm doing all

233
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,510
this kind of stuff oh sorry non-existent

234
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:20,120
person is coming move back and then that

235
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:21,680
allows me to take whatever I want and do

236
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,060
it under the guise of doing certain

237
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,279
things thank you Dan

238
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:30,979
I appreciate it so I want you to realize

239
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:34,189
that this people in your personal space

240
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,220
is a real thing obviously I've been told

241
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,890
many times at the Swedish are more

242
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,310
interesting group when it comes to this

243
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:44,689
you seem to be all very reserved people

244
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,939
you don't like laughing at too many

245
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:52,760
jokes but that's fine I like a challenge

246
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,350
but that being said I do have to work

247
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,959
and try and get into your personal space

248
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,019
and I usually find under the guise of

249
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,630
being a jovial person that tends to

250
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,180
break barriers that is the perfect

251
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:08,390
reason for you guys to worry when it's

252
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,769
dealing with security someone is being

253
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:18,230
really nice and you don't know them that

254
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:23,180
should be a warning and in that case arm

255
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,990
distance is great I can't reach anything

256
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,569
at Dan's reach if Dan puts his arm up I

257
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:33,920
sort of like a stiff arm in in football

258
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:37,070
or security arm kind of thing I can't

259
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,599
get any closer to take anything so if

260
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,279
you don't feel comfortable with someone

261
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,520
in your security and you're talking to

262
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,980
someone new I find just a nice resting

263
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,400
arm on their shoulder whenever they

264
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,580
decide

265
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,579
to get a little closer I move with them

266
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:59,180
helps out a lot now another technique

267
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,070
that is fun for me I don't know if it'll

268
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,630
be fun for you guys is dan dan has the

269
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,040
wallet in the back pocket he also has

270
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,590
some other things now I noticed you have

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,319
a hanging item yes

272
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,060
but I'm curious on that one hanging item

273
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,490
is it the normal kind or do I have to do

274
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,150
like a special coat oh it does you got

275
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,530
to twist it that's lovely

276
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,449
I'll let you get it to a normal position

277
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:28,160
just for a second so we can sort of

278
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,570
explain it okay so to steal something

279
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,699
like this if we can get the camera to

280
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:36,800
move just a little bit down and over

281
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,600
perfect obviously I'm not going to do

282
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,870
this part if I see this I'm gonna find

283
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,740
the next person that has a normal one it

284
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:49,940
is an opportunistic skill for a reason

285
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:52,280
but that being said once we've gotten

286
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:57,100
this to this position I find these

287
00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:01,370
hanging items are very easy to take

288
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:04,730
because once it's office person meaning

289
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,910
it's not leaning on him anymore Dan

290
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,250
doesn't really feel anything I can move

291
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,130
this around pretty easy as long as

292
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:15,830
there's no jingle jangle of keys or in

293
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:21,020
this case small containers of unknown

294
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:23,660
substances but once we have it in this

295
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,170
position where it's unlocked I can quite

296
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:32,000
easily pull that off so those little

297
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:35,170
hang these little yeah not the capsules

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,540
the the hook that you get for for

299
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:40,849
mountain climbing or yeah carabiner

300
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,380
thank you I apologize I I've dealt with

301
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,240
these things for 10 years and I still

302
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:50,030
don't know their name but this part here

303
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,040
is so easy to deal with you just when

304
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,310
you don't have a twist lock on it you

305
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,819
just squeeze it it's as easy to put on

306
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:01,390
as it is to take off

307
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,460
it's just a squeeze and as long as Dan

308
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:09,760
doesn't know I'm behind him I can take

309
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,560
my time and do this if Dan is talking

310
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,430
about something and we all know Dan can

311
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,949
talk about stuff I have all the time in

312
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,680
the world to take my time set this up so

313
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,390
Dan doesn't feel anything I probably

314
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,839
could get away with doing that part

315
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,850
there - about there and then when I want

316
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,330
to do the final move without him feeling

317
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,520
anything

318
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,580
oh sorry Dan and I just give them a

319
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,730
quick shove and now I've got it and I

320
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,980
make my getaway okay I'll let you put

321
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:47,650
that back on

322
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:49,780
now all this takes practice you're not

323
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,000
going to get it on the first try you're

324
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:56,770
not gonna get it on the second try you

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,540
may not get it on the twentieth try but

326
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,020
you have to practice to get good at it

327
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,540
and the only way you get good at it you

328
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,630
can have makeshift dummies at home to

329
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,349
practice the technique but unfortunately

330
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:14,740
you just have to do it if you just

331
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:16,600
follow Nikes ad of just doing it you

332
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,720
will get caught because you've never

333
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,280
done it before that's where the rub is

334
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,130
it's sort of like you can't get hired

335
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,829
until you get experience but you can't

336
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,200
get experienced until you get hired so

337
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,640
it's sort of the same thing with

338
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,100
pickpocketing you can't get good at it

339
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,830
until you do it you can't do it until

340
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:39,040
you're good at it

341
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,900
it's a weird weird moment there I'm

342
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,400
gonna ask Dan to sit down for one moment

343
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,050
thank you so much Dan we're gonna borrow

344
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,699
somebody else for one second so we can

345
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,880
go over a different thing here thank you

346
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,100
very much Dan now I'm gonna go over this

347
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,950
one part here and if it's okay we're

348
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,840
gonna borrow you again okay

349
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:58,330
just so I can go over this part because

350
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,430
my favorite thing that I've noticed

351
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:04,150
being here at this talk is a lot of you

352
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:07,030
have smartwatches gosh there's a lot of

353
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,470
good information on those watches so if

354
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,790
you can steal one of those and hand it

355
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,880
to one of your friends that can deal

356
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:14,349
with one of those all you're laughing so

357
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,360
how do we take one of those off well

358
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:20,949
Warren you tell the person to roll up

359
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:24,339
their sleeves makes my life easy doesn't

360
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:26,200
it yep again get you to concentrate on

361
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,329
whatever it is in this case it was my

362
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,520
ring okay you would hold your hand open

363
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,990
so we're gonna go over this part just so

364
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,710
we can kind of understand what's going

365
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,920
on I asked him to close his hand around

366
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,710
the item I do the little silly gag of

367
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,540
the pulling the finger thing but we

368
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,720
won't do that right now we'll save you

369
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,220
the trouble of that dad joke but when

370
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm turning this over all I'm doing is

371
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:59,490
squeezing here but I'm doing that under

372
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,820
the simple guise of rotating his wrist

373
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,440
the proper way the go the other way it's

374
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,649
assault

375
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,220
okay so to do this part it's very simple

376
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,780
I put my hand and finger right here I

377
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,420
give it a squeeze when I'm squeezing and

378
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,490
I asked him to rotate his wrist I use

379
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,840
the friction of my finger to take it out

380
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:25,960
of those two little safety tabs I give

381
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,580
it one good squeeze hold on tight when I

382
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,530
ask him to hold on tight I give it a

383
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,379
pull

384
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:34,990
and that pops the pin once we've popped

385
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,660
the pin I use the same finger to open

386
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:43,930
that up and I'm ready to go I keep my

387
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,750
thumb on the face of the watch to make

388
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,020
it stay there I don't want him to feel

389
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,930
it come off ever but I don't want him to

390
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:57,850
feel this part because this part opening

391
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:00,190
allows air to go underneath have you

392
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,199
ever loosened to watch a bit and then

393
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,170
you feel all gross because air touched

394
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,350
all the sweat under your hand even sure

395
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,660
you'll all notice it now okay but when

396
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,070
that happens it's gonna bring a tension

397
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,580
down to here and I don't want that

398
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,730
that's why I squeeze this here okay this

399
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:22,820
is ready to go the pin

400
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,580
it's back we push this off and I'm here

401
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,520
I don't want this to go anywhere until

402
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,909
at the absolute last minute or last

403
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,680
second so I'm gonna hold on to here for

404
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:37,250
a couple more seconds I'm gonna make a

405
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:44,630
dumb joke drop the ring open the other

406
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:47,960
hand and then I steal the watch now that

407
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:54,560
being said there are a multitude of ways

408
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:56,560
to take a watch the question is which

409
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,480
way is better

410
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,090
they all work equally well it's just

411
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,480
what do you want to take do I want to

412
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:07,879
take this version here do I want to try

413
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,150
and take there's a gentleman from the

414
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,800
security there who's got a fancy watch

415
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,280
it looks like a leather band but it's

416
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,200
actually designed like a Rolex and that

417
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,270
will definitely gum up the works when

418
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,810
I'm trying to work with it unless I know

419
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,620
that already so I do reconnaissance I

420
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,879
appreciate you coming up here I'm gonna

421
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,830
continue talking I don't want you

422
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,150
standing there to awkwardly there are

423
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,510
different kinds of watches so we have to

424
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:40,010
practice different kinds to slide them

425
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,870
off to yank them off to make horrible

426
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:46,520
noises with our mouths as we pull the

427
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:48,530
velcro off as long as there is some kind

428
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,180
of distraction we can get these watches

429
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,370
off now I know some of you in the back

430
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,890
are probably going now you can't get

431
00:20:52,370 --> 00:21:00,439
this version cuz this one has to do the

432
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:02,570
thing if it's a standard kind of watch I

433
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,820
can guarantee you anyone that does this

434
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,000
for a living or worth their salt can get

435
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,500
it off it's just a question of them

436
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,980
distracting you enough or directing your

437
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,620
attention enough for them to get it the

438
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,300
same thing goes for lanyards the same

439
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,969
thing goes for just about anything that

440
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:25,490
is worth of either value or importance

441
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,870
okay now

442
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,759
normally this is where I ask people ask

443
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,678
questions but I've been warned that some

444
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,889
of you may not want to ask questions

445
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,789
until I'm done this talk and then you'll

446
00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:40,979
try and corner me in the bar

447
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:44,610
so I invite you to ask your questions

448
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:48,539
now because I want the interaction to

449
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:50,370
work with it and I will let you know

450
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,289
that you can come to me at any time

451
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,939
after I will be happy to answer those

452
00:21:52,289 --> 00:22:00,330
questions provided that those questions

453
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,889
are asked also now otherwise I'll be

454
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,009
very grumpy and I won't want to answer

455
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:06,629
later so does anyone have any questions

456
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:10,850
they would like me to kind of cover

457
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:10,850
thank you for being very brave sir you

458
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:22,350
how about you just yell it out and I'll

459
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:24,799
repeat it into the mic how do I steal a

460
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:31,500
badge there's different ways

461
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:33,000
particularly bees yeah now I've noticed

462
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,679
that you guys don't have the same one I

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,750
have the one I have has a nice little

464
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:43,440
clip at the back does yours oh they do I

465
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:49,049
don't have a red one so I didn't see so

466
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,350
and yours is all tied up my day might I

467
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:55,470
see yours dear since your yours is off

468
00:22:52,350 --> 00:23:00,449
already and quickly just that not you

469
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:03,119
it's fine thank you for the offer

470
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:08,799
[Laughter]

471
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:14,949
now taking these off are just the same

472
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,450
as any other any item that you want to

473
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:22,330
take you have to know how they come

474
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:24,700
apart now this part here I probably

475
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,090
wouldn't worry about this part at all

476
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,789
I wouldn't deal with this at all I would

477
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,259
deal with this part down here because a

478
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:36,850
lot of you are thinking you're very

479
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:38,710
savvy and you tie it on your belt or you

480
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,029
put it somewhere where you feel like I

481
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,619
am a different kind of person I don't

482
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:44,350
want this hanging around my neck I'll

483
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:47,350
put it somewhere else but the nice thing

484
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,029
is is that these are just like Dan's

485
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,509
little hook they're what you call it

486
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:58,899
again din carabiner in the fact that

487
00:23:52,509 --> 00:24:03,299
that just opens if I can get close

488
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:03,299
enough to open that that will fall off

489
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:10,210
the question is is how do i distract you

490
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:11,559
to get this I get that so I'm gonna have

491
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,169
to be in your personal space a little

492
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:17,889
more than usual I'm not gonna be able to

493
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:20,409
cheat and sort of be beside you or in

494
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:24,039
front of you like I have to be a lot

495
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:25,600
closer thank you very very much so in

496
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,249
order to do that I have to come up with

497
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,389
other ways that I want to get in closer

498
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:33,639
to do those things

499
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:35,918
I might have to I would do V time okay

500
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:39,129
let me preface this there are two

501
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,019
circles of this particular skill there's

502
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:45,070
the criminal side and there's the

503
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:48,070
Entertainer side taking this would not

504
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:52,299
be entertaining unless you want to see

505
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,279
someone looking barest or hurt to take

506
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:57,158
one of those I would be belligerent I

507
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:00,820
would be rude and probably swear in your

508
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:03,489
face but that allows me the distraction

509
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:06,908
to get into your personal space put my

510
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:10,570
hand on it pop the pin take that as I

511
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:12,759
push you and walk away now if I'm

512
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,760
working by myself I wouldn't want to do

513
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:18,520
that but if I'm working in a team which

514
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,820
most peak peak pockets do I would do

515
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,670
this thing I have my tag that's

516
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,570
important and then I hand it off to my

517
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:31,110
partner and then you come and angrily

518
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:34,929
come to me I've got nothing on me now

519
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:36,729
I've taken care of my job you're gonna

520
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:39,100
come and be angry with me that's fine I

521
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,350
don't have any evidence now I've handed

522
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,990
it off to somebody else and that's what

523
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:50,409
makes it in not entertaining to do as a

524
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:53,050
performer it makes it more fun to well

525
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,810
not really fun for you let's put it like

526
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:57,669
that so I hope that answers your

527
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,280
question does anyone else have any other

528
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:02,250
questions yes I'm seeing hands I love

529
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,450
this I'm gonna go further back because

530
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,970
hardly anyone ever gets asked further

531
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,970
back let's go with this nice person here

532
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,520
how many times have I been punched in

533
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,870
the face I've lost count but not because

534
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,179
of this

535
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:24,049
have and the reason why I'll bring this

536
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,490
up is for this reason I do martial arts

537
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,760
I've been doing martial arts for over 20

538
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,320
years now that helps with the confidence

539
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,900
of getting into people's personal space

540
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:38,850
so if you are in those certain avenues

541
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,980
you will find this a lot easier to do

542
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,540
and perform than others if you're not

543
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,770
used to having people in your personal

544
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:51,210
space so I enjoy the joke but notice how

545
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,620
we turned it into an actual thing let's

546
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,720
try over here yes did we get the

547
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,090
microphone working I think it's working

548
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,910
yes yeah what did I do wrong when I

549
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:10,168
stole your phone oh your attempt okay

550
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:11,610
okay yeah no no sorry you hesitated when

551
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:13,470
you're taking something if you hesitate

552
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,360
you have a higher chance of being

553
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,299
noticed than then just straight up

554
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,379
taking it now you don't take fast fast

555
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:26,570
does not mean good fastest means fast

556
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:30,990
smooth is better than fast smooth works

557
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,370
with that mentality so if you're taking

558
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,500
something from the back we want to move

559
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,479
the camera I'll save Dan though to worry

560
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,510
on this part if we move the camera down

561
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,480
there so we can see this part here oh we

562
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,950
get the whole view that's great there we

563
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,100
go if we can zoom in on just the back

564
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,590
end there perfect when you're taking

565
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,370
this out what you were doing you were

566
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:56,928
doing this right trying to slowly do

567
00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:00,149
this but in that jerky motion I felt it

568
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:07,260
so when when you have your grip on the

569
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:10,830
item that motion is much better okay so

570
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:15,419
when you're taking something you have to

571
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:19,100
commit if you don't commit you will get

572
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:23,669
caught does that make sense

573
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:26,428
thank you in this day and age with me

574
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:27,779
too is it harder to get close to women

575
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,179
these days than

576
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:43,039
men I have not noticed that but that

577
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:43,039
could just be me now that being said

578
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:51,749
women make their job easier for me

579
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:53,099
because I think it well we can go down a

580
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:55,049
whole rabbit hole and I'll be happy to

581
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,639
explain this further but essentially

582
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:01,349
women's clothes aren't designed to keep

583
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:03,779
things in their pockets luckily we have

584
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:06,389
a plethora of bags for you to put all

585
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:09,389
your stuff in and that doesn't touch

586
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:10,939
your body at all that makes my job so

587
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:13,339
much easier

588
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,320
because I can reach into that pocket

589
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:20,539
that is designed specifically to hang

590
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,399
off you and know I have noticed here

591
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,469
that people are very good with closing

592
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,218
up their purses their messenger bags and

593
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:30,869
their backpacks kudos to all of you

594
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:32,489
however in normal life you will notice

595
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:35,488
especially now that I've mentioned it

596
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:37,830
how many people just walk around with

597
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:40,799
these open bags because they're in a

598
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:44,639
rush and when these bags are all open

599
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,710
like this taking stuff out of bags is

600
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:50,939
not hard when you when you know how easy

601
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:54,389
it is to take it off a person so yes and

602
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,919
no yes it will be harder because the

603
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:58,349
clothes are not designed to have stuff

604
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,769
in the pockets but no because women have

605
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:04,918
bags to put their stuff in and makes it

606
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:06,419
easier for me to get in there so got the

607
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,359
joke out of the way but we got an actual

608
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,739
answer I hope that's okay

609
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:13,978
all right awesome oh we got another one

610
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:16,349
yes how do you keep yourself safe in a

611
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,979
crowded space how do how to keep

612
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:21,269
yourself safe

613
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:23,460
I mean you specifically me specific okay

614
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,289
so under the context of the question I'm

615
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,729
assuming how do I protect myself from

616
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:30,899
someone stealing stuff from me yes okay

617
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:33,359
there's a couple things you can do is

618
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:35,849
very simple one limit what you have on

619
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,009
you you don't have to have everything on

620
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:39,509
you I know some of you are worried about

621
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,600
people going through your stuff in your

622
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:44,330
room

623
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,250
but if you're that concerned with going

624
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,530
into a big open space you should limit

625
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,450
how much money how much valuables you

626
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,629
have on yourself especially being a

627
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,490
tourist so if that's something that

628
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:57,860
you're concerned with a limitation of

629
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:01,420
what you have on you is always best take

630
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,040
essentials only not bunches of stuff

631
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,760
because if the more items you have the

632
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,800
more this Divis up your attention so if

633
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,790
you're worried about your cell phone

634
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:18,950
your wallet your keys it's three things

635
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:22,720
and then you bring a lanyard you bring

636
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:25,190
your second cell phone you bring your

637
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,900
card reader you bring like all these all

638
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,820
little items that you want to put in

639
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,200
your pockets now you have multiple

640
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,710
things to worry about

641
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,240
that divvies up more attention I don't

642
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:41,180
know about you but if you ever tried to

643
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:44,690
juggle and then sing and then also ride

644
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:47,990
a bike that's kind of difficult so if

645
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,670
you're making it easier on their job by

646
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,980
putting too many things in your pockets

647
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:54,550
because it divvies up your attention so

648
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:59,390
that would be my bird my main thing

649
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:02,960
absolute essentials that's the first

650
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:05,360
thing second this one's a little cliche

651
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,520
and it comes from cops like actual

652
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,260
police officers when they see someone

653
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,430
that's gotten into a brawl and they're

654
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,340
like what would you done in my situation

655
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:17,330
and the answer is I wouldn't have been

656
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:21,050
in that situation because had an ounce

657
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:22,669
of prevention and all that if you feel

658
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,909
like this is going to be a place that

659
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:28,430
you don't want to be in don't go follow

660
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,500
your instincts on that one if you find

661
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:34,010
yourself being somewhere and you have to

662
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,540
be there that's different but if you

663
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:41,600
don't have to be there then don't be

664
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:44,120
there and I will say this as a safety

665
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,800
measure for all of you now that some of

666
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,919
you kind of understand how this works

667
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,860
and we'll go into more detail in person

668
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,270
in in person on practices and yes you

669
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,740
will actually get I will let you reach

670
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,110
in and

671
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,690
take stuff out of my pocket I don't

672
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,899
discriminate it'll be fine

673
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,910
but if you find yourself in that

674
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,740
position there's too many people around

675
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:09,580
you and you think that this is gonna

676
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:13,840
happen let them take your wallet

677
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:19,510
it's better than a knife and the ribs so

678
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,800
I mean it's borderline robbery at that

679
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,100
point they might as well just say give

680
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,419
me all your stuff but if you find

681
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,570
yourself you've gotten to that position

682
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,550
just you know let them take the thing

683
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,330
out of your pocket and just report it as

684
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:36,520
quickly as possible but prevention is

685
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,990
your best bet which is just try not to

686
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,480
be in those situations if you found

687
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,600
yourself in that situation try and get

688
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,730
out as easy as you can and at that point

689
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,860
it's one of those things where you know

690
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,890
take the change out of your pocket throw

691
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,240
it out the floor and run kind of thing I

692
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:55,059
hope that answers some of your question

693
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,890
I do tend to ramble I apologize I saw

694
00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,360
some hands at the back I want to make

695
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,920
sure I don't miss back people because I

696
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,800
can see people in the front let's get

697
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,240
this yet this gentleman this is sort of

698
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,300
a two-part question okay let's say

699
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,609
[Music]

700
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:14,949
there's a specific item that someone

701
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:16,899
puts in their bag yes and well I can

702
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:20,618
join you as an example because I would

703
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:23,980
see it how would you do find the Kindle

704
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,320
I have in my bag and take it okay it's

705
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:31,570
very good question

706
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:35,230
in Hollywood it appears the pickpocket

707
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:37,619
just walks up takes the item walks away

708
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:42,070
it's almost like a crime of passion I

709
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:44,950
think it just happened in reality I'm

710
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,960
gonna I'm gonna do intel on you if you

711
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:54,428
have said item in said bag

712
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:56,139
I want the item I see I would not be

713
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:58,080
able to do it in like the two minutes

714
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:00,430
that we would be having you up on stage

715
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,080
because what would happen is is that I

716
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:05,830
noticed there is an item that I need out

717
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,509
of that bag then I'm gonna take my time

718
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,790
to find out

719
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,720
when that bag is no longer on your

720
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,360
person that'll take time I have to

721
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,720
follow you for a while

722
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,220
watch you eat lunch see you on your

723
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,240
breaks that sort of thing

724
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:29,649
and eventually that bag will get put

725
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:33,609
down there is something in the business

726
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:37,180
called a booster bag a booster bag is a

727
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:43,480
fake bag that you would put over another

728
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:47,799
bag and inside it clips onto said bag

729
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,990
and gets lifted with that back so I

730
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,270
wouldn't worry about the one item that's

731
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:57,009
in your bag I would just take the whole

732
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:59,259
bag and look for it later to cover that

733
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,990
so you wouldn't immediately notice that

734
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:04,630
is what's called a booster bag I would

735
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,470
walk up beside you put my bag literally

736
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:10,150
over top of yours under the guise of

737
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,919
maybe asking you for instructions on

738
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,430
where the where can I get a good cup of

739
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,040
coffee I would maybe work in a team have

740
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,279
a nice young lady talk to you a little

741
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,750
too close to get your attention

742
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,920
sorry for being sexist on that one but

743
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,750
that works on a lot of men surprisingly

744
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,890
even on nevermind we won't get into that

745
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:36,640
conversation but the bag is designed to

746
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,200
fit over your bag and then inside it it

747
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,990
compresses onto it

748
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,310
through gravity it allows me to pick up

749
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,479
my bag and walk with yours

750
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:48,490
and because my bag is covering yours

751
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,220
once you finally figure it out you're

752
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:52,750
just gonna see my bag so it's gonna

753
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,330
interrupt your brain your brains going

754
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:58,890
that man was near me but that's his bag

755
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:04,990
not my bag where's my bag so I get

756
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:07,299
deleted from the equation if I have

757
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,549
given more time I'll actually make one

758
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,410
and bring it in to demonstrate for you I

759
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:14,590
didn't have enough time this was the

760
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,390
last minute talk but we can't go over

761
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:18,070
discussions on that more thoroughly

762
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,859
after the talk if you want because I

763
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,710
think there are fascinating tools

764
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:25,009
pickpockets which actually allows me to

765
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:28,650
dive into another thing talking about

766
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:31,559
pickpocketing is not just what I have on

767
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:33,299
me pickpocketing is nowadays especially

768
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:34,799
with everyone pulling things out of the

769
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:36,769
pockets because it's uncomfortable to

770
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:43,410
sit on your phone

771
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:46,979
things get deposited on tables and this

772
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,319
allows me to work outside of your

773
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,349
pockets but still picking your pockets

774
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:57,119
and that's a whole other discussion I

775
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:58,559
hope that helps with your your first

776
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,849
part of your question do you have a

777
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:05,970
second part now know that okay the

778
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:07,559
second part was actually if you would

779
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,499
try to pick pickpocket something out of

780
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:13,769
my bag how difficult how difficult are

781
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:16,109
different types of bags just as

782
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:18,930
difficult as puzzles are some puzzles

783
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:20,788
are easy some puzzles are hard the only

784
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,308
difference is is do I want to waste my

785
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:25,410
time trying to open that if it's

786
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:26,759
important like you said the ID tag is

787
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,859
what I'm after then I'm not gonna waste

788
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:30,299
time trying to open it up and not have

789
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,880
you notice I'm just gonna take the whole

790
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:34,829
bag and then I'll deal looking for it

791
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,140
later that's where that booster bag

792
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:40,460
comes into play I hope that helps thank

793
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,259
you

794
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:47,759
anyone else ah sir nice and loud and

795
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:51,119
I'll just repeat it in the microphone oh

796
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:54,119
there he is then I got you guys don't

797
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,849
worry would it be possible for you to

798
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,079
show on yourself a priority of where I

799
00:38:56,849 --> 00:39:00,210
should put my things

800
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,150
since my RT is usually in your front

801
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:06,329
pockets I find back pockets are not

802
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:09,029
always the best place to put things but

803
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:11,309
it's also what you feel comfortable with

804
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:12,809
if you don't feel comfortable putting

805
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:16,589
things there you have to have it back

806
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:20,210
here then I would do things to make sure

807
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:23,519
they stay in those pockets people have

808
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,839
chains that attach to their wallets some

809
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,339
people will put rubber bands around

810
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,109
their wallets whatever they feel

811
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:30,328
comfortable whatever will make it more

812
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:31,799
difficult to put there one thing I find

813
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:33,410
that a lot of people don't do because

814
00:39:31,799 --> 00:39:36,130
their wallets are too big

815
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:39,920
and that's but in their back pocket

816
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,420
honestly it's just enough of a deterrent

817
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,210
I know there are pickpockets who

818
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:49,160
actually can pop buttons without you

819
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,760
noticing I tend to just not bother with

820
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,839
them

821
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,840
so whatever small deterrent if you can

822
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:59,810
make it more difficult the more likely

823
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:01,840
you will not get your stuff stolen so an

824
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:05,330
analogy for you nice folk cuz you're all

825
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,820
tech savvy I find that you guys are

826
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,980
prodding and poking security systems to

827
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,310
make to find out where the easy spot is

828
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,470
yes same thing if something is easy

829
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:18,710
you'll go for it something's a little

830
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,240
harder you'll stay away from it it's the

831
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,980
same thing with this if the pocket

832
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,459
that's in is buttoned it's too big and

833
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,310
bulky sorry for the analogy you do

834
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,460
squats and you have a round but it makes

835
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:36,259
it more difficult for me to take it out

836
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,910
if you put it in your front pockets and

837
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,130
you have tight pants or whatever this is

838
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:44,990
pretty much a great deterrent I'm not

839
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:45,590
going to go in those ok my personal

840
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,589
favorite

841
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:50,960
are those fanny fanny packs but not the

842
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,880
fanny pack they're like a belt where

843
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,740
it's it's literally just a belt and you

844
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,930
can open it up and slide things inside

845
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,490
it'll they can fit like a whole bunch of

846
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:02,180
stuff and you can have that under your

847
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:05,149
shirt those are your best if you're that

848
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,919
concern about security but a regular

849
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,750
fanny pack with a shirt over top of it

850
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,790
will do just the same amount of security

851
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,850
for it so if you're that worried about

852
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:16,520
it that would be my highest suggestion

853
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:18,710
and if you would target me very

854
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:25,000
specifically would it matter where I

855
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:25,000
place my stuff you specifically know

856
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:35,900
thank you very much sir I saw some hands

857
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,210
in the front here yes yes more personal

858
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,640
space than pickpocketing but okay let's

859
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,890
say you're at a company they have belt

860
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,170
clippers with RFID tags you have a

861
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,779
cloner that takes about 30 seconds to a

862
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,270
minute of almost contact yeah do you

863
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:55,160
have a tip on how to maintain that

864
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:57,859
contact without raising suspicion the

865
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,080
same way I try not to raise suspicions

866
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:04,130
with being in people's personal space

867
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,259
stealing their stuff is literally I get

868
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,770
away with it the best is I get to act as

869
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,390
the stupid foreigner it's the easiest

870
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:14,060
thing I can do I can just say I don't

871
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,220
understand can you please help me I'm so

872
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:21,920
sorry that I'm I don't know what I'm

873
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:23,569
doing we all want to help that's

874
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,220
unfortunately what I'm taking advantage

875
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:30,170
of so I hope that helps is it's how

876
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,270
creative can you be to be in someone's

877
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:35,630
personal space so the more questions you

878
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:39,640
can ask and apologize for the longer you

879
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:47,480
get to be there so I hope that helps and

880
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:52,040
yes with the majority of people probably

881
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,840
none it doesn't happen as often as

882
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,430
people want you to believe but that

883
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,290
being said it doesn't mean it won't

884
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:02,720
happen

885
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:04,220
it's like car accidents car accidents

886
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,990
would probably be your best not

887
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,910
everyone's been in a car accident but we

888
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,580
all heard of someone being in a car

889
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,259
accident and that's sort of the same

890
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,660
thing with pickpocketing we've not all

891
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,300
of us have been pickpocketed but we all

892
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,190
have heard someone has been pickpocketed

893
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,170
so it doesn't happen as often as one

894
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:25,850
might think but it does happen enough

895
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,710
that you should be worried about it I'll

896
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,080
take I think what's what are we doing

897
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,780
for time I'm pretty much ready to go

898
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,279
wrap it up we'll do one more question

899
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:37,790
okay let's get one more question and

900
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,140
then Dan been saving you for last buddy

901
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,650
let's do it okay

902
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,848
are there such things as like honey pots

903
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,130
for pickpockets there's they're like

904
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:49,220
booby traps or fakes that you could do

905
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:50,930
to like make it look like an easy so

906
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,419
like in computer security you set up a

907
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,950
honeypot and you make it look simple

908
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,660
right you'll get script kitties and

909
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,879
other people love like yes like hacker

910
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,799
detritus trying to do terrible things

911
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,289
and failing horribly is does that

912
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:06,559
concept exists in pickpocketing I know

913
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:08,779
for myself it does because I like trying

914
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,549
to see if I can find people in my area

915
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:14,089
that actually do the same thing I do and

916
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:15,890
quite frankly it's having items that

917
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:18,380
stick out of pockets you you're

918
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:23,420
literally just making their job easy

919
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:25,640
it's bait yeah so a pocket with tissue

920
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,880
at the bottom so the phone doesn't go

921
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,739
all the way in same with a wallet make

922
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,579
sure the wallet isn't over thick that

923
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:38,170
kind of stuff watches that don't have a

924
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:38,170
band they literally sit like this

925
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,970
I'm pickpocket worth their salt can

926
00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,098
easily just do that undone it in like

927
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,839
ten seconds flat five seconds if they're

928
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,220
really good especially if they got

929
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,049
nothing else to work with I'd literally

930
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:53,348
just pop a pin and we're good to go

931
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:57,819
yeah there's ways of making it more

932
00:44:53,349 --> 00:45:00,410
attractive thank you no no problem folks

933
00:44:57,819 --> 00:45:02,839
I've been given a time limit and this is

934
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:05,779
all the time I have but I've been told

935
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,670
that I am allowed to be up on the second

936
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:09,349
floor and do like a little mini

937
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,029
workshops tomorrow so if you are

938
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:13,220
interested I'll be happy to answer more

939
00:45:11,029 --> 00:45:15,559
questions and sort of go over techniques

940
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,629
I hope my talk has been valuable to you

941
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,450
I've had an absolute wonderful time here

942
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:23,640
thank you so much

943
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,640
[Applause]
