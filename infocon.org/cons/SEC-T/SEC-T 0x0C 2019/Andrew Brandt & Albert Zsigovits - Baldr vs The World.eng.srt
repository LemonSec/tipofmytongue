1
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:10,150
so let's get to it welcome to sakti

2
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:13,719
conference actually this is my second

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,990
time here in Stockholm but I still love

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,790
the city I have to say this is my first

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,070
time presenting at any conference so

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,770
bear with me

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,439
this presentation is about a relatively

8
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:29,380
new stealer malware that made the

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,779
headlines not so long ago and I just

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:36,160
really want to give you a 30 minutes

11
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:38,949
primer to it just a little bit about

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,699
myself I've joined even the industry

13
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:44,649
from a traditional blue team background

14
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:47,620
I've worked as a ideas analyst in stock

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:51,999
and also as a senior is incident

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:54,640
responder at a fortune 50 cert I have

17
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:57,219
keen interest in trade hunting memory

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,929
forensics signature development and I've

19
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,329
been also learning reverse engineering

20
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:04,180
for about a year now

21
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:07,720
I just had my first publication and this

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,520
talk is about that and I also just

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,710
released a small technical write-up

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,060
about another family called dark rats

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:22,000
version 2 on my github so the goal of

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,490
the talk is just to present findings of

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,380
the past four to five months I would

28
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,149
like the details some features and

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,570
functionalities that the malware had I

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,020
want to touch briefly on the dark and

31
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:36,940
deep web economics I also like to

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,420
outline some mistakes that the

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,640
developers made and just you know

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:47,560
overall just to share technical analysis

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,060
with you right I've been advised to put

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,190
this up but this is really not very

37
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:56,350
important so we can go on as you might

38
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:01,179
that might have noticed the mother's

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:04,419
name is Baldur I honestly I didn't

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,710
really heard any bother before and I

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,530
thought it would be interesting to

42
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,879
investigate what inspired the mavar

43
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,010
developer to call his creation better so

44
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,969
I obviously looked it up and it turns

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,969
out is from NARS

46
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:25,359
but not from the recent movies that

47
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,238
contains some Norse mythology's so in

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,739
those movies Odin had two sons Thor and

49
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,500
Loki but in reality or they had four

50
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:39,370
sons and one of them is called Baldur

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:41,650
and that's our topic today we already

52
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,709
know that there's another family called

53
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,159
Vidar in the wild which was also

54
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,410
inspired from Norse mythology mavar

55
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,679
developers love Norse mythology for some

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,840
reason and I'm sure you can guess it's

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,670
only a matter of time before America

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,349
called Valley comes out so let's talk

59
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:06,970
about the Hardin Oliver is distributed

60
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,828
we first picked up on Baylor when we

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,670
were analyzing certain YouTube video

62
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,890
videos promoting cheat software's and

63
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:19,298
trainers for country struggle or even

64
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:23,200
for apex legends these would often

65
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:26,049
contain aims wallhack CSPs I'm sure you

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,510
know these things the youtube video's

67
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:30,970
description usually contains the

68
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,950
malicious link that fetches the actual

69
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,030
chief software but it is also bundled

70
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:39,540
with better we also saw better being

71
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:42,730
distributed in discord channels too and

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,590
we also found that bad there was bundled

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,590
with the crypto wallet applications

74
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,400
Balor was also sold on certain defect

75
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,590
forums so this chart kind of

76
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,079
demonstrates how the price of this

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,790
simple stealer increased significantly

78
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:06,780
throughout the past four to five months

79
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,230
the first version as as you can see was

80
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,120
solved for about a hundred dollars and

81
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,578
each new version each new iteration of

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,668
the malware was cause for the

83
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:21,760
distributor to raise the price the

84
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:24,490
seller and the distributor regularly

85
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,960
promoted special discounts in order to

86
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,419
attract more customers to buy the

87
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,580
malware and as you can see towards the

88
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,729
end

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,650
better kept around 150 US dollars and

90
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:40,229
towards the end you'll see design better

91
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,349
sales closed down and I will get to that

92
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:42,349
later

93
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:48,720
the developer and the distributor did

94
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,580
not exclusively gain income from the

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
initial sales but it turns out they were

96
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,710
also listed reselling the stolen

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,520
customer data that the stealer collected

98
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,580
to further monetize the operation so as

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,049
you can see a stolen crypto wallet

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,500
accounts when fourfold

101
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:11,699
four dollars each game accounts went for

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,259
half a dollar but if you add up all of

103
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,409
these numbers they go up to a

104
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:21,509
significant amount we were also trying

105
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:23,909
to ascertain the impact of this

106
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,340
malicious software by drawing a heat map

107
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,430
and it was interesting to see that it

108
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,109
had the most impact in Singapore Brazil

109
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,930
and Russia but we can only guess why it

110
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,580
is like that at the moment it's not that

111
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,370
clear

112
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,560
since the developer is also Russian it

113
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,130
also made us curious why Russia is even

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,759
on this map but it looks like this was

115
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,120
not exclusively meant for outside Russia

116
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,330
but the distributor was trying to cast a

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,800
wide net and so that it would reach as

118
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:04,469
many victims as possible by the way if

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,580
you're curious the the data behind the

120
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:12,860
map comes from virustotal and basically

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,389
I just channeled it through

122
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:22,139
elasticsearch and Cabana to give some

123
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:23,069
visual representation yeah so digging

124
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,080
through virustotal

125
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,919
we have found hundreds and thousands of

126
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,550
victim logs and by just simply using

127
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,380
simple aggregations we had the potential

128
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,830
to highlight some key findings for

129
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,419
example showing you the top 50 in all

130
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,520
accounts of stolen credentials

131
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:46,900
and obviously it's no surprise that

132
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:56,099
Gmail Yahoo or hotmail were amongst the

133
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:59,258
top stolen credentials yes so Baldur was

134
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:03,729
mostly distributed or delivered through

135
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:10,979
to attack vectors one of them is is

136
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:14,229
through CV 20 18/20 25 25 oh this is a

137
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:19,240
vulnerability in one of the ace archive

138
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:22,628
library so upon opening the ACE archive

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,330
the unpacking program for example VJs

140
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:27,279
would only show you a decoy file which

141
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,969
is in this case as you can see it's the

142
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:34,300
help dot txt file but actually there's

143
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:35,560
another file inside the archive but the

144
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:42,029
unpacking program wouldn't show it to

145
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:47,770
you so yeah due to this vulnerability

146
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:50,889
the in the S or kyv library open or

147
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,650
unpacking the archive the malicious p32

148
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:56,979
file which you can see in with the green

149
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,979
marker will drop onto a payload drop

150
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,020
location silently in as you can see in

151
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,378
the middle section that's the location

152
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:08,830
and if you can read it it says programs

153
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,110
slash startup so up on the next red

154
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:16,330
starts of the PC the stealer would

155
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:19,210
automatically Ram yes so we can further

156
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,909
a memory enumerate the ACE archive file

157
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:29,549
with a simple Python script and this way

158
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:32,559
we now can see the payload to the other

159
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,860
attack vector was distributing better if

160
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,468
you rigged the RTF files and using a

161
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,899
simple script called RTF dump that by we

162
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:44,680
can easily extract the objects from the

163
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,870
RTF file and just write away two of them

164
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,260
stick out it is object seven and an

165
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,279
object M

166
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:56,860
in object seven there's a huge p32

167
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:03,040
executable which is obviously already

168
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,510
suspicious enough in an RTF file but we

169
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,050
still don't know what triggers the

170
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,470
execution the PPE 32 payload is there

171
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,839
but we didn't really see why it's

172
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:18,640
executing so looking further into object

173
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:22,209
10 there's actually six streams in

174
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,589
equation that free object and on the

175
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:28,930
right hand side on stream 5 we can see

176
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,440
that there's an actual some kind of

177
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:35,920
magic going on there so actually this

178
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,570
part that says CMD that exe that part is

179
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,290
actually a font name section and

180
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,130
essentially what it does it just

181
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,569
overflows that section so essentially

182
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:53,589
again it's just a stack overflow

183
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:55,600
vulnerability yes so just to sum it up

184
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,750
these are the functionalities that the

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,310
malware had first of all it gathers lots

186
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,610
of lots of information from the victim

187
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:06,930
PC secondly it takes the screenshot of

188
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,839
the of your desktop it also steals

189
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,420
credentials from all of your browsers

190
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:17,500
steals browser cache autofill entries

191
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,550
and yes the banking card information too

192
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:25,180
if you save those it also gets to the

193
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,060
telegram local cache but dumps VPN

194
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,769
clients as well FTP clients XMPP clients

195
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:38,920
as well and it also steals any crypto

196
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:42,519
wallets the malware had some pretty

197
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,560
basic anti analysis techniques one of

198
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:48,279
them is just having nine layers of

199
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,969
obfuscation so it's very hard to make

200
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,620
sense of the actual source code the

201
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,300
automatic deal the office caters don't

202
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,940
really work on this one so you have to

203
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,579
go and manually find out what each and

204
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,990
every class or function does since the

205
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:07,050
code is actually written in C sharp

206
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,970
to make the analysis even harder the

207
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:13,740
developer also introduced threat based

208
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:16,079
execution which basically enables each

209
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:22,199
of the previously listed functionalities

210
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:24,719
to run simultaneously as previously

211
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:27,870
stated better has the capability to save

212
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,129
a screenshot from your desktop but while

213
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:34,230
we analyze the source code we had spat a

214
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,149
interesting approach that was I think it

215
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,509
was trying to fool static detection

216
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:43,470
rules because the screenshot it would

217
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:45,449
get saved into screen that JPEG but the

218
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,089
actual source code does not contain that

219
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:51,269
string rather a base64 encoded version

220
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:55,769
of the string which later gets decoded

221
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:58,019
on-the-fly and we think this might be an

222
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:04,519
attempt to evade certain ideas or AV

223
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:06,899
rules so about information gathering

224
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,149
these are all the information that the

225
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:13,920
novel is trying to fetch from your

226
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:16,889
machine yes it's quite an extensive list

227
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,599
and it's a very important list for

228
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:24,120
fingerprinting or finding out everything

229
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:26,009
about a certain victim and yeah I could

230
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,610
say the developer didn't leave anything

231
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:29,870
to chance

232
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:35,730
he wanted to get everything from your PC

233
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:39,389
and this is what the exfiltration phase

234
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:42,209
looks like so once the previously

235
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:44,279
discussed threads are down these are all

236
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:48,569
the files that the Baldur's filler would

237
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:52,259
gather up and every information would go

238
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,300
into different files and folders all of

239
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,540
these would get packaged up into a file

240
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:02,008
called encrypted zip and it would be

241
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:04,620
pushed out to a c2 server for example

242
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,929
just some details the passwords that log

243
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,999
file that you can see on the screen

244
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:12,029
would obviously would contain all your

245
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:13,709
browser credentials the cookie domains

246
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,889
that lock file would contain all your Q

247
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,128
keys

248
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:26,980
and obviously FTP VPN clients would be

249
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:29,769
in those folders as well so the malware

250
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,119
developer and distributor kept quite an

251
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,759
open front door in terms of

252
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:36,879
communication they each had their own

253
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,439
telegram profile and basically anyone

254
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:42,669
could initiate the conversation with

255
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:45,069
them to buy the bad or malware it has

256
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:47,679
become very common in cyber crime scene

257
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:52,529
to do communication via telegram or

258
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:54,988
other means for the ease of use and

259
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:59,829
telegram is also considered to be a

260
00:13:54,989 --> 00:14:02,379
secure platform for some reason but

261
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:05,919
obviously profiles could be reported

262
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:07,989
banned or blocked and using a little bit

263
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,639
of social engineering you could always

264
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:15,639
get some extra information from the

265
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:17,649
developer or the distributor better

266
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:21,069
operations were also supported by a

267
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:24,189
telegram bot which basically enabled any

268
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:27,849
potential customer to buy them by the

269
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:30,429
malware with the cryptocurrency one

270
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:34,029
interesting thing was that the crypto

271
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:36,910
addresses that were used to do the

272
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:41,040
purchase were generated on the fly so

273
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,040
there were no traces or history to them

274
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:46,179
this boat was also removed at a certain

275
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:52,600
point from telegram leaving border

276
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:55,629
operations unreliable but all of these

277
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,809
would be for nothing if if it burns for

278
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:01,569
bulletproof hosting services usually we

279
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:03,399
refer to hosting firms or companies as

280
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:06,689
bulletproof when the service they

281
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,860
provide allows their customers for

282
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:11,498
considerable tolerance in terms of

283
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,439
hosted content and they achieve this

284
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:15,910
tolerance by hosting clones of the

285
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:19,329
malware on dozens of different IP

286
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:23,919
addresses and switch the domains DNS to

287
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:26,649
point at different IPS frequently we we

288
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,120
have identified a few of these and name

289
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,089
the top three and

290
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,300
right hand side these were my you know

291
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:39,880
that REO Pro hosted that bees and ISP

292
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:41,620
system that are you better version three

293
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,220
that all brought some advancements in

294
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,810
terms of encrypting the c2 traffic

295
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,420
however it's still very easy to spot

296
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:55,959
some sort of regularity the c2 data

297
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:58,660
contains a section for the XOR key it

298
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,339
also has a separator malware version

299
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:08,170
number and some additional server

300
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:10,529
settings just to dig further down and

301
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,000
understanding the c2 response a bit more

302
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:15,010
again so the first four bytes are the

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,220
eggs or key then there's a free bite

304
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:21,310
separator which is followed by three

305
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:26,200
bytes version number and after that is

306
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:28,119
just server settings obviously there

307
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:33,450
will be some Webber rules which I will

308
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,450
detail just in about a minute

309
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:41,859
using a simple deep decryption routine

310
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,750
we can easily decrypt the content I've

311
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:48,490
got a small spider Python script to

312
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,430
decrypt the C to traffic and obviously

313
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,950
now we have the plaintext parameters

314
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,800
sock or certain Alice could use these to

315
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:04,390
write different detection rules for

316
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:07,839
example in your ours ricotta the Baldur

317
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,870
malware see two servers have a very

318
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,149
distinctive login forms so in version

319
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:17,770
2.1 the login page had this interesting

320
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,130
example form as you can see on the right

321
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,589
side but version 3 that I lost some

322
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,790
changes and the developer turn to HTTP

323
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,100
basic authentication this respect this

324
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,770
was a move to make better panels

325
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,379
blending between other sites so

326
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:39,010
ultimately scanners wouldn't be picking

327
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:41,310
up on these highly distinctive login

328
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,310
forms

329
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,310
once you're past the login form the

330
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,450
first thing you'll see is the main

331
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,850
dashboard

332
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,480
it's basically an aggregation view of

333
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,100
all the logs collected by the c2 server

334
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,380
there's a breakdown section for top

335
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,800
three countries and top operating

336
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,470
systems on the top menu bar you also

337
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,280
have the option to do some settings

338
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:09,040
around the c2 server do some search

339
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:14,010
converts and cookies these sort of

340
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,300
things once during the settings menu

341
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,010
you'll have the option to choose what

342
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,889
kind of logs you want to collect from

343
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:24,910
your victims machine it could be either

344
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,180
cookies autocomplete information go for

345
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:31,300
FTP if you want to VPN do the screenshot

346
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,260
or not and there's one thing on the

347
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,240
bottom section it's called Weber rules

348
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,120
these rules a specific rules which allow

349
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,900
you to collect additional files from

350
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,629
your targets machine and as you can see

351
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,590
the screenshot on this specific c2

352
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:53,050
server the malware operator was trying

353
00:18:50,590 --> 00:19:00,399
to collect files from the desktop and it

354
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:02,830
downloads folder as well as the malware

355
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,510
was mainly promoted on Deep Web forums

356
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,470
we had the chance to look through some

357
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:11,290
of the conversations the the developer

358
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,750
or the distributor had at one point the

359
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,020
distributor even claimed they had more

360
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:22,240
than 200 clients which is a customer

361
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,760
base we should not ignore on the 31st of

362
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,120
May batters distributor released a short

363
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,820
note both from telegram and both on the

364
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:36,219
FF forums that the matters development

365
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:39,520
would not continue and it turns out it

366
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,500
was because due to some internal rivalry

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,500
between the distributor and the

368
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,150
developer I guess they couldn't agree

369
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,230
how much money would they make

370
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,700
from from these cybercrime operations

371
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,220
the Anna's announcement came as a

372
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,920
surprise for the Steelers customer base

373
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,230
because they were expecting a new

374
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:08,490
feature upgrade called version for that

375
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:11,070
Oh on that day and however Baldur's main

376
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:14,750
distributor points new customers to

377
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,790
another Steeler called Krypton and

378
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:23,460
distributor basically names Krypton as

379
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:25,139
the successor of badder I think it's

380
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,720
important to outline a couple of

381
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,890
mistakes the developer or bad their

382
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,480
customers made that obviously allowed us

383
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,080
to gain additional insights into the

384
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,420
mother's operation so first of all these

385
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:43,980
c2 servers were often come misconfigured

386
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,780
living web folders wide open some of the

387
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,000
c2 panels were using passwords like

388
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:53,639
admin admin or admin one through three

389
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,210
some of sometimes wrong file permissions

390
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,910
may certain key files accessible some of

391
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,600
the c2 servers even had other protocols

392
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:07,080
like FTP my sequel completely open and

393
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:11,639
misconfigured so those granted a further

394
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,580
access into the city server these panels

395
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,250
are often prone to local file inclusion

396
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:22,169
or remote file inclusion whichever is

397
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:24,780
your style all these would ultimately

398
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,120
lead to having multiple websites on a

399
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,450
given server leaving them to be some

400
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,429
sort of valid Wild West where there's no

401
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,380
clear standoff but rather multiple

402
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:41,700
script kiddies fighting for the victim

403
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:43,170
data and finally I just wanted to give

404
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,610
you a few lessons learned from

405
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:50,340
dissecting this dealer these malware

406
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,800
developers often take code from other

407
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,929
model families like as a road with our

408
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,290
RK

409
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,930
they even take code from Stack Overflow

410
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,970
which is kind of dodgy or other coding

411
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:06,600
forums just to make the release of their

412
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,360
mother faster evidently they are lazy

413
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,610
and prone to making mistakes and that's

414
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,570
where we analysts come in to find leaks

415
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:19,949
shortcuts this piece of stealer is not

416
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,750
feature-rich but it doesn't really have

417
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,550
any persistence capabilities

418
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,240
it doesn't place any mutex on your

419
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:31,230
system it quickly gets what it was

420
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:35,580
supposed to do it is also interesting to

421
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:38,790
observe how one piece of of of a stealer

422
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,030
inspires other mailer families because

423
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:48,270
with batters demise a new malware called

424
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:51,090
Krypton has emerged now that would be

425
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,300
its I'm not sure if you have any

426
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:57,270
questions now you can just raise your

427
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:01,500
hand now or come here at the end of the

428
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:06,870
talk and ask me some questions I'm not

429
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,280
trying to push it but all right that

430
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,979
will be all thank you for listening to

431
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:17,619
me

432
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:17,619

yeah so if you're interested there's the

434
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,660
full report of this malware it's a 70

435
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,850
page report details everything every

436
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:37,500
function every feature if you perhaps

437
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,300
would like to check out my github or

438
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,280
Twitter accounts I would appreciate it I

439
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,740
regularly post findings about new

440
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,610
malware families and release new malware

441
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,740
write-ups and yeah that's it thanks for

442
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,669
being here and enjoy your safety

443
