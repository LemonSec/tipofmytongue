1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,429
hello and welcome back to seconds

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,090
because I'm live from safety well almost

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,980
live anyway

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,570
almost life broadcast exactly

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,130
broadcasting not streaming there was an

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,930
important point made yesterday I think

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,750
yeah I'm sitting here with yes / Larsen

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:22,020
and Hudson treble Hudson you know I've

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,730
got those reversed yep so we just

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,609
listened to a really amazing talk what

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,070
was it about said this the talk was on

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,859
my research about building hardware

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,680
implants for board management rollers

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,230
bmc's it was inspired by the the

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,329
Bloomberg story the big hack from last

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,510
year yeah and I was trying to figure out

17
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,610
what is the technical feasibility of

18
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,660
these sort of implants without trying

19
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,500
recognizing that we don't know whether

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,538
or not the story happened right but

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,090
technically they're totally feasible

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,399
yeah correct but you I think your ISA

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,800
was really good because you actually

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,420
visited the the whole supply chain what

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,009
was that about did what was it on your

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,990
holy day or he's like no I'm gonna do

27
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,880
this I'm gonna go to China and have a

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,429
look what why did he do that well I had

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,439
a wonderful opportunity to tour a bunch

30
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:19,859
of PCB manufacturing as part of a friend

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,199
of mine was running a tour through these

32
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,179
factories for some startups and Silicon

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,299
Valley so they could see what's involved

34
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:31,139
in making a physical product and I was

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,770
invited to tag along and really jumped

36
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,990
at the opportunity

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,939
it was a nice friend to have right yes

38
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,189
it looked really cool that was actually

39
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,139
a very fascinating part of your talk I

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,669
thought because it gave me an insight

41
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:45,109
that I had never had before it yeah

42
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:49,200
right the manufacturing actually happen

43
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:50,969
yeah and it's a it's interesting how

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,139
much of it is concentrated in the

45
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:56,699
Shenzhen area yeah so the the ones that

46
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:59,699
I was able to photograph for some of the

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,409
small small manufacturing I did have the

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,149
opportunity to tour some much larger

49
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:10,679
ones but they had no photos but one of

50
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,870
them had moved to 100% x-ray of their of

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,150
the board's coming out for certain high

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,220
assurance customers yeah

53
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,160
and they also has an effect of this

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,440
article or just as Quality Assurance

55
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,840
they ramped it from sampling to a

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,900
hundred percent I thought yeah okay of

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,450
course I specifically looking for four

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,630
implants at that point but rather than

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,190
just checking for the connections that

60
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,540
are in place and all that kind of stuff

61
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,040
right it was fairly common for for high

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,750
reliability parts if you're building an

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,920
aircraft or spacecraft parts to x-ray

64
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,260
them all right but doing it for computer

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,079
products was mostly just to verify that

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,609
the manufacturing processes were you

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,290
know up to par Department that the

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,880
solder joints looked good and so on

69
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,160
because that's like in the aviation

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,380
industry and in the oil rig industry you

71
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,820
x-ray a lot of you welds to see that you

72
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,200
don't have cracks and anything cause it

73
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,390
really high pressure and so forth but

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,250
here it makes sense just to see that you

75
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,739
you're getting what you get you shown a

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,080
really nice slide about the fake RSU

77
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,300
free to ship that was pretty cool when

78
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,970
they x-rayed when they what do you call

79
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,040
it d capsule encapsulated it's like

80
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,070
completely different yes it looks

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,109
exactly the same on the surface and so

82
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,400
there's there's I didn't really go into

83
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,870
it in the talk but there's several

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,750
different types of counterfeits that

85
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,670
people are concerned about there's the

86
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,580
the ones that I did mention with the

87
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,890
salvaged parts there's the ones where

88
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,830
some parts are made on what's called a

89
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,049
ghost shift where you've sort of we're

90
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,960
going home now but let's make a thousand

91
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:49,050
more anyway exactly right and then

92
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,720
there's these other ones which are work

93
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,970
alike where that's and then they they

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,320
have them packaged to look like the same

95
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,900
chip but inside is a completely

96
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,090
different process and from a security

97
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,640
perspective that's actually the scariest

98
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,940
one yeah because who knows what other

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,279
functionality could be hidden yeah

100
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,780
that's really crazy I we sort of we had

101
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,880
it would had an episode about this where

102
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,709
we discussed this thing in in detail and

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,230
the only thing it well you sort of you

104
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,089
have made it absolutely clear for

105
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,410
everyone in the audience and everyone on

106
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,060
the internet now that this is feasible

107
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,540
right this is actually this could be

108
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,500
done but the amount of effort put into

109
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,080
doing this

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,180
is sort of it's so massive right you

111
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,099
need to intercept if you're gonna do it

112
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,050
at scale up so you need to like you need

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,330
to go into the manufacturing plant and

114
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,570
everything so but since everyone denies

115
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,490
this why was it there what was the

116
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,500
article why did it appear well you guys

117
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,760
think yeah why did the Bloomberg article

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,810
appear well I'm not sure that any

119
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,830
intelligence agency would want to do it

120
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,510
at scale right I think they got one or

121
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,180
maybe ten right I think they would want

122
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,000
to target a very small number of

123
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,490
customers it helps a whole lot for

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,750
concealment if if you see me free

125
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,970
containment if you're only going after

126
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,880
one otherwise anyone who buys a super

127
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:16,080
micro board could potentially find this

128
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,219
sort of thing exactly so there's you

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,430
know as I've pointed out the targeted

130
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,090
access operations let's then tailor it

131
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,310
to a single customer yeah okay yeah okay

132
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,590
that makes a lot more sense as you

133
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,850
mentioned as well like so intercepting

134
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,609
something that's going to a specific

135
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,050
customer then it's not a supply enchant

136
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,810
attack though then you just short ship

137
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,820
it and then put your that's more

138
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,250
feasible yeah I would say so

139
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,530
it's supply chain from the perspective

140
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:49,950
of the customer yeah exactly yeah and as

141
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,869
I point out Super Micro was very clear

142
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,510
in their letter that all of the they're

143
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,070
protections are on the manufacturing

144
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,990
process that once it leaves their

145
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,780
factory they don't have any it's hard

146
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,100
for them to control right makes sense so

147
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,619
do we think that there's actually

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,590
occurred or do we think as my opinion

149
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,660
was this short in the stock market for

150
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:15,239
Super Micro yeah I really tried to avoid

151
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,640
speculating yeah about any of the sort

152
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,930
of the motivations for why the story

153
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:25,590
appeared when it appeared and and so on

154
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,850
you know it seems to me that the that

155
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,280
they had been working on it for a really

156
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,630
long time that in in the article

157
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,210
Bloomberg mentions that they had been

158
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:39,300
talking to sources going back almost to

159
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:42,070
the to the 2015-2016 timeframe so it had

160
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,979
been a multi-year story

161
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:48,639
I don't know what was involved in in

162
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:51,219
their timing decision it's because

163
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
everyone that was named the story has

164
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,650
denied it

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,889
oh there's a one one guy right oh yeah

166
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,409
yeah yeah that way yeah it's don't you

167
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,610
find it strange that they haven't

168
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,100
retracted the story I find it very

169
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,530
strange that they haven't retracted or

170
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:13,000
provided more detail yeah that it seems

171
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,159
that if they have made statements that

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,070
they are confident in their sourcing and

173
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,240
that that the editors are confident in

174
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:25,000
the anonymous sources and typically in a

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,860
news organization the editors will meet

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,900
with or know who the anonymous sources

177
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,150
are it's not that the reporters can't

178
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,229
just say oh I talked to some guy and he

179
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,210
learned he told me this the report

180
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:40,120
checked and rechecked because no who

181
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:43,060
knows how like an what it is call the

182
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,960
SBI looks like if they get a schematics

183
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,870
of something

184
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,310
how could you as a journalist yeah well

185
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,580
source the truth out of that I don't

186
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,530
know you maybe help in a in a certain

187
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,440
way maybe Bloomberg is trying to save

188
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,270
face by by not retracting and standing

189
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,150
by their claims and like well all could

190
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,289
be one case tell you our sources so are

191
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,270
you just gonna have to take our word for

192
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:06,760
but I did the argument this so late I

193
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,280
think it's really sound that since this

194
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,840
is an ongoing like a there you can

195
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,030
actually see that it's a lot of work

196
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,979
behind it and then it sort of makes

197
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,909
sense that's there is sexually they've

198
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:21,219
been working on it for a long time so

199
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,469
yeah I don't think that legitimate is

200
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,919
legitimize the whole thing itself but

201
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:29,590
still it's like yeah there is something

202
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,500
there and I yeah I'm getting scared like

203
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,559
must be I mean obviously we don't know

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,929
the full story as you mentioned but it's

205
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,838
certainly feasible and there's probably

206
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:44,939
a grain of truth or a grain of rice yes

207
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:51,550
I think there's a rice grain sized yeah

208
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:53,650
and the you know my feeling is that very

209
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,399
well might have been a t800 type thing

210
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,699
yeah

211
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,310
you know I would not be surprised if if

212
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:03,128
there are lots of these sort of teo

213
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:06,239
implants out there and they're going to

214
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:10,079
get harder and harder to find that the

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,999
you know again with with a zero budget

216
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:17,370
sort of capability you know you can

217
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:17,370
still produce quite a bit of interesting

218
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:26,259
implants and the which the is that the

219
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,139
NSA playset a group has been making a

220
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:32,259
lot of recreations of things out of the

221
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:35,350
ant catalog with basically hobbyist

222
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:39,459
budget and people are now bundling all

223
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,949
sorts of electronics into USB cables yep

224
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,349
that are you know again being done by

225
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:47,498
hobbyists with with equipment at home

226
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,319
you know it's yeah the the latest one

227
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:53,589
was the Apple the charger Thunderbolt

228
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:56,229
charger yeah yeah and if you tear apart

229
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:58,809
a Thunderbolt cable did you know that

230
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,420
there are CPUs in the cables and both I

231
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:05,620
had no idea that they and they have

232
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,079
firmware and in fact if you plug a cable

233
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,040
in sometimes they'll tell you your

234
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,989
device will ask you to please whoa with

235
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,849
the it wants to update the firmware in

236
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,370
the cable but it can only update the

237
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,740
local end but they can they can

238
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,269
negotiate with the other and say oh this

239
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,339
end is running a different version from

240
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,379
the other anonymous because I bring the

241
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,850
cable around I didn't know much so that

242
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:32,439
it can update the other ones what else

243
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:36,639
crazy yeah and yeah Moore's law has

244
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:38,670
given us just microscopic yeah CPUs yeah

245
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,699
you showed it in your slide as well this

246
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,889
cortex the ARM Cortex processor is like

247
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:48,128
really really really the size of two

248
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:51,399
transistors in a 65 the tail it's it's

249
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:53,499
incredible how much Moore's law you has

250
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,860
meant in terms of transistor density

251
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:58,480
yeah yeah and that means obviously it's

252
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,069
gonna be almost impossible to detect

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,800
yeah and in like you guys said like this

254
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:07,110
will be feasible because it's yeah why

255
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,910
not right yeah

256
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,649
just going back to the Bloomberg story

257
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:14,010
because I can't quite remember but they

258
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:16,260
mentioned that the plan was laminated

259
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,089
between the PCBs and that story so in

260
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,880
the story they mentioned that their

261
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,550
sources had found a number of implants I

262
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,019
don't remember the specific number one

263
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,209
of which was the signal coupling

264
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:32,250
capacitor or a signal coupling sorry

265
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,739
signal conditioning coupler right the

266
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,240
size of a grain of rice and then an

267
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,890
additional implant was that one

268
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,760
laminated inside the PCB and in it is

269
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:47,850
relatively I wouldn't say common but

270
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,300
it's occasionally you will find embedded

271
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:54,120
passives in in PCBs it's a very

272
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,250
expensive process to to have it

273
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,899
manufactured that way but it is if you

274
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,300
go to a PCB house that is something that

275
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,300
they will offer to do for you yeah but

276
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,410
that also means that in that case it

277
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,870
would have to be part of the

278
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,870
manufacturing process yeah exactly

279
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,300
this is where the cover story completely

280
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,740
breaks down as you you know it's obvious

281
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,010
when it happened

282
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,200
you know I've also for the

283
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,050
jack-in-the-box talk where I was

284
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,920
bypassing a bhoot card I did build a

285
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,329
smaller proof of concept that was 0.6

286
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,120
millimeters thick and would fit

287
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:32,279
underneath the flash chip so you could

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,339
desolder the flash chip but it that's

289
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,020
that's not and that was unless you were

290
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,760
really looking for it yeah you wouldn't

291
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,100
you wouldn't be able to and this would

292
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,520
fit in in a laptop with with the cover

293
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,350
closed this is really cool stuff so you

294
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,959
know that again zero budget sort of

295
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,660
attack yeah but you know the fact that

296
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,089
we can fit a Neff pga and a small flash

297
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,930
memory and a voltage regulator yeah you

298
00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,750
know in in this microscopic size and

299
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,239
going back to what would Joe Fitzpatrick

300
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,070
pointed out no one knows what's supposed

301
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,110
to be in their hardware anyway right so

302
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,860
if you open your laptop and there's a

303
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:14,220
riser card underneath your flash chip

304
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:15,170
that's right oh this is scary stuff but

305
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,249
so yeah

306
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,139
this is only gonna get it's open

307
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:25,239
hardware for everyone period

308
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:28,670
it's it helps you know it does mean that

309
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:33,410
that motivated customers could validate

310
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:37,389
what they have but again in an ATO sort

311
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:40,100
of thing it would be very hard to tell

312
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,889
you know how many do you need to sample

313
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,049
to determine if you're being targeted

314
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,059
yeah right and obviously you only need

315
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,489
one yeah from an attackers point of view

316
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,699
one wonderful thing about from an

317
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:55,339
attackers point of view on the BMC is

318
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:57,889
once you have code execution on one they

319
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:59,359
typically share a common VLAN or a

320
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:02,660
common network segment between all the

321
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:06,169
BMC s so horizontal movement yeah yeah

322
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,179
the core easy yeah so everybody

323
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:10,879
listening to this you should throw out

324
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:14,089
your computer by a risk of five and yeah

325
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,569
open hard before the wind oh yeah open

326
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:18,529
hardware and then get the capability of

327
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:21,378
analyzing all your hardware and a

328
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,970
microscopic imagining changing computers

329
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:26,959
every other year that would be terrible

330
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,110
so not again yeah I mean just just being

331
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,419
able to actually verify even if you have

332
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:35,929
the specs like this is exactly how it's

333
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:37,970
supposed to be actually looking through

334
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:41,509
it and verifying that nothing is added

335
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,489
or moved right and doing that on the

336
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:45,470
hardware level is difficult on the

337
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:49,119
software level we perhaps have some

338
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:51,559
ability to do it I am a big fan of

339
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:53,389
Hardware roots of trust and what's

340
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,809
called a remote attestation yeah where

341
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:59,239
the system is able to cryptographically

342
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:01,488
sign something saying this is the the

343
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:03,799
firmware and the kernel and the Annette

344
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:07,239
Rd and the configuration that is

345
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,169
actually running on the machine which

346
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:11,689
you know potentially gives you the

347
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:13,970
ability to detect if something has been

348
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:16,160
modified along the way there's not

349
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,709
that's like incorporated in the CPU or

350
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,959
somewhere where it's exactly so then you

351
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,819
sort of that sort of phase but I know

352
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,529
what you mean like with the what is it's

353
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:30,219
called TPM and what's about the no my

354
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,220
brain is fried

355
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,490
it doesn't matter oh yeah

356
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,680
carry on yeah I mean but this is a very

357
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,350
very hard problem to solve I think

358
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,359
because you can usually go one step

359
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:46,480
further or put your implants somewhere

360
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,480
else or move to software or firmware

361
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,870
right although if the if the root of

362
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:57,619
trust is is well designed and well

363
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,290
secured an attacker who modifies the

364
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,240
firmware would be detected in the

365
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,699
attestation phase that the idea is that

366
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,420
you don't necessarily care what has been

367
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,750
run afterwards as long as you can prove

368
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,579
which you know the hash of yeah well

369
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,130
what part was manipulated and sort of

370
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,840
directly get her reference or a warning

371
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:21,650
death hey this is not that how it's

372
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,240
supposed to be right right and so there

373
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,459
are some there are a few examples of

374
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,690
this in use for instance Chromebooks

375
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:32,450
will attest to Google the version of

376
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,790
coreboot and the Linux kernel that they

377
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,430
have loaded before they before you login

378
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,439
to Google and they can they can Google

379
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,329
can say you know this is a modified

380
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,400
Chromebook maybe you shouldn't trust it

381
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:46,130
right through that remote attestation

382
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,079
that's cool and I think we need to have

383
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,500
this sort of capability across all of

384
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,730
the systems yeah there's a neat project

385
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,710
from mauve add called a system

386
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,660
transparency yeah where they want their

387
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,080
servers to be able to attest to they're

388
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,770
up to you the user that it is it has not

389
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,390
been tampered with

390
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,849
yeah and I think this this sort of

391
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,579
mutual remote attestation it's really

392
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:11,419
nice really nice yeah yeah I mean that's

393
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,869
a good way to to go I mean if we can if

394
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,970
we can get there yeah but then again

395
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,609
there's firmware everywhere it really is

396
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,250
yeah so it's not gonna be easy but

397
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,379
hopefully we can get closer anyway

398
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,119
hopefully weird yeah wood talks like

399
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,190
this shedding lights on it I think it's

400
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,439
a really good step in the right

401
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:32,180
direction and mobile as well presenting

402
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,150
this system transparency stuff is really

403
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,420
good yeah so be interesting to see if

404
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,120
anything else comes to the

405
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,920
yeah yeah I would like to follow up at

406
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,110
some point that would be really awesome

407
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,570
to read perhaps next year at secti we'll

408
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,270
have two years on yeah what do we know

409
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,030
but keep going into something and pop

410
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,620
something yeah all right do you have

411
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,060
anything else I think we're good I think

412
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,889
was really nice meeting you are really

413
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,360
nice listening to you talk really good

414
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,280
thank you for having me on the

415
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,290
podcasting very much and we'll see you

416
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:10,030
guys again just in a little bit

417
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:10,030
