1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:08,530
so the way the cookie crumbles I didn't

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,100
prepare really a lightning talk I never

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,040
do

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,239
I prepared a challenge the center

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,768
challenge if you haven't solved it

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,200
please do there are some nice prices

7
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:19,149
still there fetch but yeah of course I

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,560
work at center and that's why I prefer

9
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:23,189
the challenge instead of doing lightning

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,238
talks I'm gonna try to do this anyway so

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,040
first of all unfortunately I'm gonna

12
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:30,040
have to explain a really stupid old bug

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,229
that is what an almost 20 years old it's

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,000
called CSRF and it's really boring so

15
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,160
let's say that we have a authenticated

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,440
system of some sort and you log into it

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,390
with your username and doesn't really

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,789
matter okay so now I'm authentic ated

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,609
there is a button there I should

20
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:49,870
probably not push it but let's try oh

21
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:51,640
snap so that was bad for me I should not

22
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,828
have done that so let's just forget it

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,559
ever ever happened and hope that yes

24
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,620
okay so that didn't happen let's log in

25
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,759
again so I don't want to push that

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:09,899
button obviously now to explain the

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,970
concept of a you CSRF vulnerability I

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,940
load a say another page in the same

29
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:22,060
browser let's say I visit this page okay

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:26,050
so as some sort of mail system I got a

31
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:30,340
web page here of some sort and as you

32
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,500
can see there is a image down there so

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,180
let's go back to see what the status of

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,920
the reactor is let's update that oh snap

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,470
so somehow that button got pushed that

36
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,240
way and for all of you who've been doing

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,929
any kind of web security you realize

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,570
that this image actually points to the

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,830
URL that caused the reactor meltdown

40
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,139
it's just a simple stupid request that

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:59,380
is sent from my browser but even though

42
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,260
it's sent from this site this site

43
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,449
causing my browser to send the request

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,960
but still it's yet it gets authenticated

45
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,819
and that's why this still works so this

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,180
has been like an issue for the past well

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,179
18 years at least

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,450
so they figured out a way of solving

49
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:23,510
this

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:26,629
it's called same side cookies and I'm

51
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:30,469
sorry so instead of using that crap the

52
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:32,239
old login I have an improved login that

53
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:34,730
will give me a better kind of cookie

54
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,099
which is basically just if you used

55
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,980
normal set-cookie header you add to it

56
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,988
the attribute same side which means that

57
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,018
the cookie will only get sent

58
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,489
if the request originates from the same

59
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,120
site that you want to send the cookie

60
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:54,859
from that means that it will still work

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,919
if I if I push the button on the site it

62
00:02:54,859 --> 00:03:00,919
will still work but if I load if I

63
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,139
reload this then the request my browser

64
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,379
sends because of this page will not

65
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,060
cause the other page to to do what it

66
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:11,540
just did so let's try and update that

67
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,540
sure okay so same site cookie appears to

68
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:20,899
work it provides it's solving this

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:23,298
problem which is great of course if I

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,620
would be stupid enough I get new mail

71
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:29,389
and in this mail there is a link so

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,310
there are some limitations the same side

73
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,959
cookies of course because you might want

74
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,629
to be able to click link and end up

75
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,060
authenticated in another system so in

76
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,929
this situation I have link and if I

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,620
click that link

78
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,810
well again I end up in this bad

79
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,250
situation where it basically meant that

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:53,629
I clicked the button that I didn't want

81
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:56,540
to click okay so that is bad now there

82
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:58,879
is there are several different ways of

83
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,798
solving this one of the ways of solving

84
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,168
it would be to force the request to

85
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,269
check the request and ensure that it's

86
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:12,489
not a guest or head request that's

87
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:14,569
actually a post request but let's

88
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,298
experiment again because you could do

89
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:19,339
you could set even stricter saying site

90
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,219
attributes so now here's another

91
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,650
improved version and now I'm using again

92
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:27,350
the same site attributes

93
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,060
but now this time I'm using the strict

94
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,180
value instead of the lakhs value that I

95
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:46,130
did in the previous round let's try and

96
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:49,100
load that mail again okay so if I click

97
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,930
this then I end up at a page where I'm

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,060
not authenticated so even though I

99
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,210
clicked the link now this thing's that

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,130
strict attribute means that it's still

101
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,229
not sending the cookie so when end up

102
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,430
unauthenticated is this page which is

103
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:03,229
good because that means that I'm

104
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,780
actually protected from this type of

105
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:10,400
attack even though I'm not even checking

106
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,859
the method of the request and so it

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,870
seems this problem is solved if you just

108
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,220
add the same site strict attribute to

109
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,500
your cookies of course it means that

110
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,419
people won't be able to land on a logged

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,620
in on your application from clicking

112
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:27,440
other applications but there is of

113
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,960
course an issue and now here's the

114
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,960
running point because this is really

115
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,460
experimental so I don't know if this is

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,789
great because it's browsers or caching

117
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:46,780
stuff so I'm just gonna well let's see

118
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:51,500
let's do this again I am opening this

119
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:55,190
I'm logging in with the same site strict

120
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,139
attribute so now I have this really

121
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,460
solid strict cookie I should be

122
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:10,160
protected from pretty much everything

123
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:13,510
let's try and load a third mail okay I'm

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,510
just gonna take a little short break

125
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,719
let's go and reload this page again Oh

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,440
No

127
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:30,469
so apparently that didn't work why is

128
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,770
that how could this possibly have

129
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,140
happened well it's as easy as checking

130
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,469
the source code for the web page and

131
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,860
what it says is oh it's a pre-render

132
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:45,470
link and it specifically says in the

133
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,440
specification do not send same site

134
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,310
cookies on pre-render linked and yet

135
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,719
chrome does exactly this and I sort of

136
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,100
expected them to fix this because I

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,170
prepared this talk for the spring pub

138
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,430
and I also posted it to a bunch of

139
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,110
people saying hey you guys are bug

140
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,280
bounty hunters you just submit this to

141
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,560
Google and probably earn some money

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,510
because I'm not gonna do that because I

143
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,340
believe in pen testing not bug dantas oh

144
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,430
sorry no I believe bug Mantis of course

145
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,520
and no plans of thing where it anyways

146
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,110
so this still works if there are new

147
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,109
added bug bounty hunters that want to

148
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,570
cash in on this feel free to do so but

149
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,310
be aware if you use same site cookies to

150
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,190
protect your site against cross-site

151
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,080
request forgery then please check the

152
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,780
request methods because this is not

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,640
water salt water tight yet it might be

154
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,940
some point in the future but this still

155
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,099
works I probably will work for at least

156
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,210
have you in boar days I guess for

157
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,790
someone submits it and that's it bill

158
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,799
ahead of time

159
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,860
[Applause]

160
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,860
you
