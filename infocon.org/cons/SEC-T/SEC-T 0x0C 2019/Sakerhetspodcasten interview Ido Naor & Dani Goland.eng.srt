1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,110
all right hello and welcome to seconds

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,639
what cost net secti and I'm Rick at

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,750
before and I have theater in Tucson and

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,480
to two of our speakers today

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:22,520
IDO and Danny right very welcome you

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:26,540
delivered the talk today about attacks

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,020
on on crypto exchanges and a lot of the

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,170
content was about exfiltrating the

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,820
proceeds of the set attacks can you can

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:38,269
you just briefly elaborate on that

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,999
because I think in in a lot of cases

12
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:53,839
that is actually harder than doing the

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:56,539
high yeah so I was thinking like if

14
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,699
you're an attacker right you steal some

15
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,769
money and right now you're still in

16
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,199
cryptocurrency but let's say you steal

17
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,489
some shirts you're ready to sell them

18
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,229
somehow you're going to need to find a

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,070
market to liquidate add to actual

20
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,960
dollars yeah

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,779
this was no spurious I need money for

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,500
their missile program or I don't want to

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,180
name anything but so I was thinking I

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,220
bother cashing out how easy is it to

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,170
cash have it and start going through it

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,770
I'm looking at the tracing the money

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:27,410
going out from the wallets and seeing

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:31,670
that it hits exchanges that are in very

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:32,720
sketchy places that have no real kyc

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,640
which is know your customer or

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,650
anti-money laundering procedures yeah

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,450
and allow you to withdraw money super

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,390
easily like you don't see that money

34
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,850
going to coinbase cracking those topics

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,790
changes which have a lot of volume but

36
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,860
they will not allow me to take out 100

37
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,950
bitcoins in a day with

38
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:55,600
proving who you are your passport ID you

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,110
know even like utility bill so um you

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,179
were talking about more the technical

41
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,530
aspect of aspects in frustration yeah

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,630
exactly and and there were some

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,729
interesting correlations between

44
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,920
previous attacks and and how you were

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,710
able to connect them through through

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,780
some of the the attack vectors yeah what

47
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,270
I originally wanted to prove is the fact

48
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,640
that they are evolving more like it's

49
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,870
not it doesn't seem like they're they're

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,730
in some sort of a shifting towards

51
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,040
another vector or different target

52
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,380
because we do see that as well yeah so

53
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,630
we do see how they trying to exhaust a

54
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,519
specific target and it doesn't end up

55
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,780
like the way they planned and then you

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,490
know they're shifting to a different

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,970
target and here we don't see it we just

58
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:46,090
see branching out even more so that was

59
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,330
kind of the the initial is an area first

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,130
line of debate that we had land you know

61
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,350
I said no it's evolving and he was like

62
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,420
dude if there will be regulations yeah

63
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,739
they will have hard time like they have

64
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,500
hard time already

65
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,239
you know liquid leaking out potatoes

66
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,489
sorry they're the money

67
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,530
you saw the Bangladesh incident you saw

68
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:10,750
other hacks where they try to forge a

69
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:13,000
swift documents that they failed so like

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,230
in my subconscious I see that some of

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,480
these some of these facts are evenly

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,310
aligned however you know looking at the

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,700
technical side I'm seeing different

74
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:28,570
things so well if it works why change

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,600
really because you won't be able to no

76
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:34,030
money out we have I think I think they

77
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,970
will think about so I don't see

78
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,010
limitations in computers you know in

79
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,519
terms of

80
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:45,030
exploiting our automation or you know

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,519
making making like bits move from one

82
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,230
way to another if it's a human then it's

83
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
a different story if there is a human

84
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,659
need to sign some specially crafted

85
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,129
document so yeah that might stop them

86
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,019
though it would be hard to get a

87
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,849
middleman sitting in the US and some I

88
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,280
don't know big bank that you know

89
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,670
federal bank that could gain them some

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,099
you know financial income but if it's

91
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:11,040
like bits and bytes I think that we'll

92
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,230
find a way to bypass it yeah I I was

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,159
thinking about another thing the talk

94
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,548
before you guys was not streamed and he

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,620
was it was from the Swedish fre which is

96
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:28,500
an intelligence agency here in Sweden

97
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,270
and looking at different cyberattacks

98
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,240
and so on and so forth he was talking

99
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:35,280
about having something of a cloud hopper

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,430
specifically but but also about the day

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,789
as some of the problems about doing a

102
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:45,180
write up like like when you're exposing

103
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:49,260
what you know your Intel and telling the

104
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,510
world that yeah these IOC indicated that

105
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,870
this this threat actor was was

106
00:04:51,510 --> 00:05:01,260
responsible and and of course once that

107
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:03,180
goes public and they are there yeah I

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,349
don't think tipped off is the right term

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,240
they just switch they have everything

110
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,659
all set up you know we're talking

111
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,550
state-sponsored millions of dollars they

112
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,260
have everything right ready if they see

113
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,449
it out in the news they don't get mad

114
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,370
you know it's not like a script kiddie

115
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,520
whoo you know we stole his export now

116
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,889
it's a so they have everything like they

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,500
have a chain of command they they decide

118
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,360
what do they do based on the news they

119
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,940
probably collect the news automatically

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,420
they know

121
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,040
how to follow the organization but then

122
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,190
the bright side of publishing those

123
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,940
IOC's is that companies Jen used those

124
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:46,390
IOC's for detection yeah so it's like a

125
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,850
double-edged sword it is yeah yeah for

126
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,820
historical data like they might change

127
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:57,070
that idea but if you have old logs you

128
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:59,650
might find the IOC similarity so you can

129
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,810
use those i/o seasons see a lot of code

130
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,969
reuse that they're using you know like

131
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,590
I'm a developer so has the belper I'm

132
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,410
not gonna write the same code twice no

133
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,419
I'll put a library for myself and then

134
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,530
use it and they're doing that as well so

135
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,690
when you see them using the same

136
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,099
functions in code similarity right it's

137
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,410
also something that you can utilize

138
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,840
those I use these for your systems

139
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,090
sometimes it's not even the code itself

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,549
because for example we had a Mac malware

141
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,760
and Windows but the similarities were in

142
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,430
the communication right spectrum however

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,680
even if that code and still the

144
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:35,080
communication is not the same we are

145
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,070
also talking about mistakes we saw some

146
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,130
incidents like the one in Asia where at

147
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,550
some point they somehow there was a

148
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,050
glitch and we saw one of the VPN

149
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,700
communication shutting down an actual

150
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,940
communication with one of the original

151
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,860
servers in North Korea so you know

152
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,600
you're like you see a communication with

153
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,130
the difficulties a type of server and

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,800
then BOOM North Korea and the middle

155
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,260
while there are some Russian strings in

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,330
the binary and yeah you know those type

157
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,810
of things is things that we see today as

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:10,630
well yeah so and another thing that that

159
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:15,250
occurred to me I mean in in this case it

160
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:19,510
seems fairly clear who the state sponsor

161
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:22,720
behind this attack is but in in many

162
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,610
times when you see an malware analysis

163
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,909
that there are attempts of

164
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,949
playing in attribution game and trying

165
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:33,800
to point the finger at China or Russia

166
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,629
or for political reasons yeah well the

167
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,280
Russia where they put Russian language

168
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:39,770
in the binary yeah and as a Russian

169
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,198
speaker when I saw the Russian it's

170
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:46,370
Google Translate Russian you know I can

171
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,349
tell you from America's press key

172
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,099
standpoint that attribution is the

173
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,560
hardest part

174
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,719
yeah and you know we always get tempted

175
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,219
to rush into attribution however you

176
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,490
know from experience we know that

177
00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,349
attribution will come last so we will

178
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,389
either wait for another company will be

179
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,639
there if we don't have like really

180
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,830
strong links we work for another company

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
for the u.s. search for you know for

182
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,599
parties who are authorized to actually

183
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,490
do the attribution legally yeah instead

184
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,620
of us doing it as a private company and

185
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,870
then when when when you have that

186
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,449
foothold for example hidden Cobra from

187
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,580
the US cert so you can actually apply it

188
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:24,199
on all of your research yeah so you can

189
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,599
say here there is a link you know to

190
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,889
this attack in you know and then it

191
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,139
links to Turkey and then it links to

192
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:32,959
some other company and then you know

193
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,149
back back to to the US search so it's

194
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,098
attributed to North Korea all of it

195
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:40,010
like based on your sir yeah I think

196
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:44,149
that's the right way to do it right now

197
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:47,630
it's it it must be also challenging for

198
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:51,290
for even intelligence communities like

199
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,810
like in vyasa was talking about in the

200
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:59,420
earlier talk and to to be 100% certain

201
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,239
because in many times there might be

202
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,880
other political aspects behind the

203
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,839
attack then I mean the bitcoins might

204
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,430
might not be the the actual target yes

205
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:17,240
should be a decoy yeah like shifting

206
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:20,060
shifting word to actually you know

207
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,320
influence politics through security

208
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,939
right

209
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,220
knocks on Midsummer's Enrico summits

210
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,140
we're done attack those on a timeline on

211
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,830
the leader went through the North Korean

212
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,890
summits we also have the P p5 plus one

213
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,590
the Dooku to that incident you know of

214
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:43,550
eavesdropping the the nuclear sanctions

215
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:46,740
on an Iran that happened I think 2016 or

216
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,219
before that yeah yeah so so yeah

217
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:55,650
politics and cybersecurity do like makes

218
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:59,660
each other right you see a lot of or an

219
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:05,010
increase I should say in this gray zone

220
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:08,370
between between sort of warfare and and

221
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:11,510
intelligence this is the interesting

222
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,620
part because from done is standpoint he

223
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,870
you know he mentioned about the

224
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,900
regulations and how the gray zone is

225
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,630
getting smaller yeah and we we gain more

226
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,850
and more understanding or you know you

227
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,320
cannot just SQL injection a bank and

228
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,420
then you know you won't be executed

229
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,960
accused and you know by law so every

230
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,500
step we do or every fingerprint that we

231
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,080
have over the Internet is have like a

232
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,150
link to some law to some you know in

233
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,690
regulation and it's keep getting

234
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,930
stronger

235
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,720
now if the gray zone will you know

236
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,300
decrease then what what then what are

237
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,940
other places would they find you know to

238
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,059
do I mean they did gambling they did a

239
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,059
lot of it

240
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,559
gambling and it are like online gambling

241
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,089
sites there was a thing for a while

242
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:05,019
right I mean they're looking for ways to

243
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:06,669
make money when triple exchanges came at

244
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,769
first they were immature

245
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,478
it was very easy to hack into them they

246
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,619
did not take security seriously like

247
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:16,109
every 25 year old and I'm 25 I was like

248
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:18,489
I'm gonna start my trip to exchange

249
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,859
because it's unregulated there was no

250
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:23,109
law in the US and well anywhere so they

251
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:25,569
just like got a couple of developers we

252
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:27,519
have an exchange running you can get off

253
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:31,209
get help some kind of a matching engine

254
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,669
yeah but no security I mean you don't

255
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:36,399
see I'm sure Nasdaq and the New York

256
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:38,468
Stock Exchange attack daily in masses

257
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,389
but their their security player and

258
00:11:38,469 --> 00:11:42,549
those immature exchanges does not have

259
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,189
but we are seeing them insuring after

260
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:48,489
these hacks and Japan put a very

261
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:51,789
circulation one security officer after

262
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:55,599
coin check yeah yeah that was it so big

263
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:57,879
hit yeah that that starts getting hard

264
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:59,999
to hack but when were talking about

265
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:03,339
spearfishing because human error usually

266
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:05,529
we can still get in so I think we should

267
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,739
also these regulations are supposed to

268
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:12,099
become effective by 2020 January 2020

269
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:15,129
and July 2020 will catch that from the

270
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:17,979
other side so they're incentive to steal

271
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:19,839
the bitcoins will get lower if they

272
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:22,479
can't actually cash it out because

273
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,749
holding Bitcoin like I said unless you

274
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:28,089
can pay your people or buy by the things

275
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:30,159
you need with Bitcoin you're gonna help

276
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,899
you too much you know hold some virtual

277
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,609
coins yeah and still with all the spoils

278
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,789
of the fact that they won't be able to

279
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:39,309
liquidate money coin check incident had

280
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,409
five hundred and thirty 1 million dollar

281
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:43,689
worth of Bitcoin which was the largest

282
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,170
in history yeah why would they do that

283
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,910
what would

284
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,740
collect all that big corn if they won't

285
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,779
be able to liquidate it because they can

286
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,010
liquidate right now you saw exchanges I

287
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:53,139
don't know if you said we're saying

288
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,310
right now on a half a billion dollar you

289
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,519
know it's not like you're going to be

290
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,349
yeah you're gonna get no just no it will

291
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,050
take tighten by through three years do

292
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,269
you know right now right now if you look

293
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,219
at it exchanges like Cuba and Russia and

294
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:07,959
some exchanges in other countries you

295
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,430
can cash out as much as you want as long

296
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,060
as there is someone willing to trade

297
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,399
with you there is no K way see or am not

298
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,500
procedures at all yeah so if they were

299
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,290
if they had enough following they could

300
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,639
have cashed it out but as you think

301
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,040
progress in every country does

302
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,779
legislation to actually license

303
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,269
exchanges in our New York already has

304
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:30,490
the New York license for stock exchange

305
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,470
that means they have to be like get a

306
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,360
license from the state to our stock

307
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,079
exchange once that happens in other

308
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,430
countries then they can take all that

309
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,069
and five hundred million it's all in

310
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,290
Bitcoin but it'll probably take them

311
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,750
what they came to actually get it out if

312
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,750
they have to show an ID and for every

313
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,490
Bitcoin or every two bitcoins that

314
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,980
they're trying to withdraw to you as

315
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,470
dollars and it will be tracked and we

316
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,690
saw the listing of anonymous joins right

317
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,899
happened two days ago that's that's

318
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,610
that's an interesting and and that is a

319
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,480
result they said we do listed

320
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,230
practically as a result of the eff ATF

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,899
travel rule yeah

322
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,329
in one word that the biggest thing that

323
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,640
can Keeler threat actor is exhausting

324
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:18,040
yeah I think that's like the major they

325
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,720
didn't send them if it's too hard yes

326
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,170
too hard and I'll find a new venture

327
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,699
they'll they'll switch switch to another

328
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,880
type of target yeah yeah exactly

329
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:32,709
yeah well great guys thanks for taking

330
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:37,050
