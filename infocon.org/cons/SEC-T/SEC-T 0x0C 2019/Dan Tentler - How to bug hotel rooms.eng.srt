1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,460
right on hey look at that audio cool

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:13,280
great so that was that was gonna be my

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,640
first question so cool not a lot of

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,080
repeats so hi my name is Dan I'm one of

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,120
the two co-founders of a security

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,979
company called Phobos group and for

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,130
everyone that's here that saw the last

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,410
few talks about how apparently China is

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,700
being a pest one of the things that we

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,340
do is we pretend to be

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,509
China and Russia for money to make sure

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,649
the blue team's know what they're doing

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:35,420
and to make sure that like your twenty

14
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:38,179
five million dollar security program is

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,399
like doing what you wanted to do and in

16
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:42,019
part of that I run the Red Team side of

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,460
the business my co-founder runs the blue

18
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,839
team side of the business so we do more

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,309
than just the attack stuff but since I'm

20
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:49,370
the attack guy I'm presenting on the

21
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:51,530
weird attack stuff so that being the

22
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,998
case here's my slide full of all sorts

23
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,949
of information that's probably mostly

24
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:56,389
relevant because nobody's here to learn

25
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:58,489
about me you're here to learn about all

26
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,260
the toys so we're gonna skip that and

27
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,049
we'll move straight to the interesting

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,870
legal implications of what happens

29
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:07,690
pertaining to bugging hotel rooms so

30
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,160
originally when I wrote this talk it was

31
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,690
designed for a United States audience

32
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,789
and the United States has 50 different

33
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:17,060
states and every state has their own

34
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,880
interpretation of the law in terms of

35
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,740
how you can do recording and what's

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,780
legal and what's not legal and the

37
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,149
really hilarious part about all of this

38
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,470
is generally speaking when people are

39
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,570
talking about doing recording and

40
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,950
there's like what's called the two party

41
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,250
law or the two party rule is that very

42
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,780
again it varies from state to state so

43
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,010
one state like California where I'm from

44
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,730
for example is it what's called a

45
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,740
two-party state a two-party state means

46
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,650
if there's two parties they both have to

47
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,390
agree that the call or the discussion is

48
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:55,430
going to be recorded which implies audio

49
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,600
however and then we'll get into it one

50
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,030
of these cameras actually has a switch

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,759
to turn on ego off and it's marketed

52
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,380
towards law enforcement so that oh if if

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,820
you want to skirt the two party law you

54
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,619
just turn the audio off because if you

55
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,369
turn the audio off it's not wiretapping

56
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,750
anymore because lawyers but none of that

57
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,760
matters because we're not in the United

58
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,780
States so I spent some time looking up

59
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,500
the law for Sweden and

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,350
boy this requires whiskey so the first

61
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,569
thing that I discovered was that the

62
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,100
article implies and this is old it's

63
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,500
from 2013 and this has been changed

64
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,959
since this says it's illegal to take

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,569
photos and video in private environments

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
without permission okay that makes sense

67
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,019
but if somebody breaks into your hotel

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,700
room they don't have permission to be in

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,239
your hotel room so how does that law

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,510
apply

71
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,750
no no not clear I'm not a lawyer

72
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:50,160
this next one says and this this is

73
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,019
funny to me because I fly drones it's if

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,280
you don't take the high-resolution

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,050
camera off your drone and you fly it

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,790
around and you get caught it you can get

77
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,050
up to two years in prison which seems a

78
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,350
little steep for just a flying camera

79
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,360
however you can put your I think it's

80
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,150
this one same an extension of the same

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,010
law there another component of it you

82
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,319
can put a camera on a car and that's

83
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,590
fine but if you put a camera on a drone

84
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,649
that's bad and and there's a lot of

85
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,640
discussion about it in Swedish and I

86
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:28,380
can't read the Swedish so I'm yeah yeah

87
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,880
so I'm definitely not a lawyer none of

88
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,530
the stuff that I found specifically

89
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,690
covers this topic which is like

90
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,880
defensively bugging your own hotel room

91
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,140
for the purposes of identifying if

92
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,150
somebody has served tisha Slee gained

93
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,890
access to your room one is doing evil

94
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,049
mate attacks or stealing your stuff or

95
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,149
planting their own bugs or what-have-you

96
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,350
I'm certainly not a lawyer if you know

97
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,940
lawyers in Sweden I encourage you to

98
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,220
find one and ask them about the scenario

99
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,040
because spending some time looking

100
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,910
around at the laws it is unclear where

101
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,100
this lives so good luck have fun don't

102
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,750
get caught

103
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,630
so again understandably this information

104
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:07,530
is very portable if you learn how to bug

105
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,200
hotel rooms like a use your imagination

106
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,269
I'm not encouraging you to bug hotel

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,680
rooms hmm but you know there there's a

108
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,269
lot of legitimate reasons to bug your

109
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,640
own hotel room and you'd think that

110
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,880
seems kind of weird and kind of paranoid

111
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,640
why on earth would you bring a thousand

112
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,320
dollars of bizarre trinket stuff that

113
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,370
you can buy on Amazon and a couple of

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,169
other likes acute security

115
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,760
websites and will believe me we'll get

116
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,060
into it I hope you all have your drink

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,760
tickets because you're gonna need them

118
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,880
this who has been to the deaf to the DEF

119
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,520
CON in the last two or three years who

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,290
enjoyed getting their hotel room

121
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,460
searched against their will by hotel

122
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:54,270
security yeah who knew that you can go

123
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,510
on I think it was eBay and by Caesars

124
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,210
Palace polo shirts for like fifteen

125
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,360
dollars and impersonate security and do

126
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:07,770
hotel room searches yourself that's fun

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,020
right like and to make it you know to

128
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,340
add insult to injury the people that are

129
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,430
officially supposed to be searching

130
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,198
hotel rooms in Las Vegas are making a

131
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,150
joke out of it and they're posing for

132
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,580
pictures with other people stuff in

133
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,130
other people's rooms that they like yeah

134
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:28,800
it's a giant ugly mess and everyone

135
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,479
hates it so cameras and then I've been

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,190
I've been bugging my own hotel rooms for

137
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,289
a while since I learned about this tool

138
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,590
here on the right that is what's called

139
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:39,240
a k22 under the door tool a k22 under

140
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,429
the door tool is designed to attack that

141
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,180
specific kind of door handle it might

142
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,130
look familiar

143
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,620
anybody that has been to the States and

144
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,690
a variety of other Western countries in

145
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,630
America that's called an OSHA compliant

146
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,070
handle OSHA oh Sh a is a I forget what

147
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:56,520
the acronym exactly stands for but it's

148
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,780
a like handle that's compliant for

149
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,820
people with disabilities and it's

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,619
compliant for like allowing people easy

151
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,840
access and there's fire code regulations

152
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,110
a bunch of other stuff so every hotel

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,090
room

154
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,500
nearly every hotel room nearly every

155
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,179
business in the United States the their

156
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,090
handles look like that which is great

157
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,669
because this tool is designed to reach

158
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,760
under the door and come up the inside

159
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,198
and pull the door handle down so if you

160
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,320
if you look at the actual thing it's

161
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,000
bendy it's like spring steel so the idea

162
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,250
is you stick you stick the thing under

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,590
the door and you stand it up and the

164
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,410
wire bit is at the top and the idea is

165
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,549
you hook the the metal the solid bit

166
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,810
goes on the outside of the door handle

167
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,250
and the wire goes on the inside of the

168
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,740
door handle and you pull on that little

169
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,690
ring under the door and it bends down

170
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,510
like that and it pulls the door handle

171
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,640
open from the inside

172
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,740
so if you buy one of these or if you go

173
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,469
to like your favorite hardware store and

174
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,350
you make one with some like spring steel

175
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,050
stock rod and like some cable or some

176
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,000
paracord or whatever it's like ten

177
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,140
dollars in parts or you can it varies on

178
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,030
the internet you can find this on like

179
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,659
Amazon for example I think they want 60

180
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,270
bucks for it

181
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,740
but you can build it for way cheaper

182
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,260
this tool is not super new it's been

183
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,060
around for several years when I learned

184
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,980
that you can do that and we were at like

185
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,870
hotels playing around with this thing

186
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm like wow

187
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,140
understanding that like the people that

188
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,120
I know in the computer security scene it

189
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,280
is not outside of the realm of reason

190
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,900
that I may open my hotel room door one

191
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,109
day and it will be up to the eyeballs in

192
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,810
bizarre inflatable unicorns so to

193
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,970
prevent like yeah I'm getting denial of

194
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,160
service but weird inflatable toys so to

195
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,770
prevent that scenario I spent a lot of

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,260
money investigating a variety of

197
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,789
different cameras to see which we're

198
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,620
interesting which were good which were

199
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,290
bad which ones work which ones are cool

200
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,930
which ones suck and I have a bit of a

201
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:48,450
review and that's what the most of this

202
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,740
talk is as explaining here's how I got

203
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,570
from point A to point B here's what

204
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,770
cameras are cool hero cameras are not

205
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,050
cool some of these are

206
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,820
internet-connected in that you they will

207
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,950
talk to a wireless network and I will

208
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,900
also be getting into how to establish a

209
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,150
hotel room or like a travel wireless

210
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,010
network which is super handy if

211
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,960
anybody's ever been stuck in a hotel

212
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,640
room waiting for a plane or or if you

213
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
get sick and you can't go or whatever if

214
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,820
you end up in a foreign city where you

215
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,620
don't know anybody and you're stuck in a

216
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,480
hotel room it's really nice to like have

217
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,220
a chromecast and like stream movies to

218
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,000
the TV like little creature comforts

219
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,130
right so a lot of cool stuff so up first

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,520
is this little guy the LA mate slim

221
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,770
black spot camera black box yes

222
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,890
la mate slim black box camera it is

223
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,620
super tiny this is it it's very little

224
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,679
it doesn't have any special features

225
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,750
it doesn't do motion and it doesn't have

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,549
like a web interface literally the only

227
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,320
UI are like these little switches on the

228
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,180
sides you turn it on and it starts to

229
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
record you turn it off and it stops now

230
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,459
the interesting thing about this camera

231
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,130
is that there's like a a vibrate switch

232
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,840
so that if you turn that on you can

233
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,430
operate this camera without looking at

234
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,320
it because it'll give you like

235
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,599
tactile pulse feedback with a little

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,650
vibrator and it'll tell you what mode

237
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,420
it's in and things like and this is the

238
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,910
one that has a little switch for audio

239
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,589
so this one is fairly expensive I it was

240
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,880
several hundred dollars which is absurd

241
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:15,120
for that this but they targeted towards

242
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,740
law enforcement so the this is like the

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,570
videos that you see that make the news

244
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,490
where like they invite some business

245
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,050
person to a dinner and then like suresh

246
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,370
lee sneaky sneaky you do the recording

247
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,479
and this is like embedded in like the

248
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,060
side of a purse or something like that

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,500
this is the purpose of this camera it's

250
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,670
designed to be covert to like do

251
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,080
interviews and things like that

252
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,520
this one isn't the best for bugging

253
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,530
hotel rooms because it only has two

254
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,689
hours of battery and like I said it

255
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,010
doesn't do motion suddenly like some of

256
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,720
these cameras like will start recording

257
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,770
when they see motion which is really

258
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,600
handy

259
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,980
unless there's weather because then you

260
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,950
have like two hours of like a lightning

261
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,300
storm that was boring but yeah

262
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,510
interesting thing probably not the best

263
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,689
for recording hotel rooms but we'll have

264
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,270
other interesting utility and feature

265
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,060
for other stuff which will also get into

266
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,920
this is some video from that camera from

267
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,359
Kiwi con a couple of years ago the date

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,060
is horribly wrong I forgot to set it

269
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,540
this is a buddy of mine trying to eat

270
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,339
the camera you you take nerds out to

271
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,870
dinner and you put alcohol into nerds

272
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,120
and the nerds try to eat equipment it's

273
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,730
just a thing that happens I guess New

274
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,410
Zealand is weird if these things all

275
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,180
handle low light pretty well the picture

276
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,010
quality is pretty good like this was a

277
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,040
dimly lit like dinner venue at night so

278
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,950
it's not too bad the next one is this

279
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,719
thing it's a DIY Wi-Fi 1080p camera this

280
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,270
one is particularly interesting this is

281
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,010
the whole thing it's got a jst connector

282
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,600
if you're into like quads and RC stuff

283
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,890
because you can attach like a one cell I

284
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,450
think you know they want to want one

285
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,630
celery yeah it's a one cell battery too

286
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:46,200
this its little your 2.4 gig Wi-Fi

287
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,330
antenna it's got a SD card slot and USB

288
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,280
and this is the way that you power it is

289
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,260
via USB and then this is the camera

290
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,850
element it's got a little heat sink on

291
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,250
the back and the cool thing about this

292
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,720
camera is that I bought it expressly

293
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,970
because I thought it would be cool to

294
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,770
like gaff tape it to the back of a hotel

295
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,410
room door and stick this in the people

296
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,079
and this will look out the people of the

297
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,640
hotel room and you and it talks wireless

298
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,290
and you can have it talk to your phone

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,329
it talks p2p which is an inch

300
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,579
thing to consider this got this little

301
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,949
QR code you scan for the app on the

302
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,420
Apple connect to it so this thing this

303
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:21,529
I'll be getting into this is a GLI net

304
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,920
slate router which this thing is burly I

305
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:29,339
probably sold five of these on on

306
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,540
Thursday I should have like made some

307
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,980
deal where I make Commission off of it

308
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,120
but these things are insane I will talk

309
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,350
about it later they're really really

310
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,630
nice so if you have a wireless network

311
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,790
in your hotel room and you have a camera

312
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,380
like this the camera will connect to

313
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,670
that thing that thing you know on the

314
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,949
internet it talks to your phone and you

315
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,110
can go elsewhere you can leave the room

316
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,699
and you can view the video from your

317
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,380
multiple cameras remotely which is

318
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,839
really really handy and also these this

319
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,750
one does do motion sensing so there's uh

320
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,290
and it looks like that which is kind of

321
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,810
cool so interesting thing with this

322
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,990
camera is you can turn motion

323
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,699
sensitivity just on or off and there's

324
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,660
no like with more advanced cameras like

325
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:10,620
if you're familiar with other cameras

326
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,600
like Foscam hamcrest axis iqi that sort

327
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,639
of stuff you can like select a region of

328
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,730
the picture to where you want to be

329
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,170
detecting motion or like you can mask it

330
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,490
out this has none of those Advanced

331
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,199
Options it's just a switch it's either

332
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,430
on or off so buy yourself a bottle of

333
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:28,109
whiskey in the case that your hotel room

334
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,310
is like in front of one of the elevators

335
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,660
in the hotel because that'll go off a

336
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,888
billion times you'll have a billion

337
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,790
photos and all your stuffs gonna run out

338
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,139
of batteries because you're gonna have

339
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,880
lots of video and pictures blooping your

340
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,000
phone every time somebody walks by your

341
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,550
hotel room the this is what the alerts

342
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,019
look like if somebody walks by your

343
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,149
hotel room or whatever walks up to your

344
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:49,260
hotel room it bloops your phone it tells

345
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:51,470
you I've detected motion it it does eat

346
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:53,730
a little bit battery on your phone but

347
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,410
everything does like what doesn't right

348
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,399
like if you run a VPN on your phone like

349
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,360
you expect your phone lasts more than

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,329
five hours so the next one this is a law

351
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,519
mate PV 500 W and this is the one that

352
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,810
you see in Hollywood like movies and

353
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,829
television and stuff like yeah this was

354
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,018
a fairly expensive one this is like a

355
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:13,469
500 ollar camera so this is the element

356
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,790
and this is a little switch and the idea

357
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,920
is that you put this in your pocket and

358
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,410
you run the switch up like your sleeve

359
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,240
in your coat and you can trigger it from

360
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,980
your coat or wherever and then this

361
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,180
thing and this is where it gets weird it

362
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,060
came with this little

363
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,189
array of things and these are all

364
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,339
buttons and the top one is a screw so

365
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,870
you can like take the button off and you

366
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,260
can like attach the button to the front

367
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,270
of this thing and you go and now it's a

368
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,740
button so the idea is you can like embed

369
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,750
it in a coat and now you have this like

370
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,720
battery powered this thing does talk

371
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,880
Wi-Fi but it's kind of silly because it

372
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,150
only you have to bind your phone to it

373
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,200
it spins up an AP and when that happens

374
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,490
obviously there's no internet because

375
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,310
they're connected to a stub network that

376
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:58,890
there's no route and you can look at it

377
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,630
you can look at its picture so yeah we

378
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,050
covered that there's a for anybody that

379
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,430
couldn't see that this is me grimacing

380
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,270
at it when I learned that it doesn't do

381
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,729
what it advertises on the box and it

382
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,010
supposedly has motion detection mode but

383
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,660
I could never get it to work it's

384
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,100
probably a neat camera to use for a

385
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,569
bunch of other circumstances but

386
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,880
probably not the best for bugging a

387
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,260
hotel room if you ever want to record a

388
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,460
conversation that sort of stuff that's

389
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,780
what it's good for but not so good for

390
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,380
like hiding in a hotel room to see if

391
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,180
like you're getting an EVA made attack

392
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,530
kind of neat lots of money probably

393
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,130
wouldn't have bought it if I knew that

394
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:37,589
it was not exactly what I was targeting

395
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,080
this one probably the most heavily used

396
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,890
camera of all of my bugging hotel room

397
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,410
experience that's this guy it's got many

398
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:50,880
names it's some janky

399
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,010
Chinese OEM chem secure a hidden tilt

400
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,870
camera the cool part about this is it's

401
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,810
got a little twisty head and you can

402
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,460
like twist the top and like hide it for

403
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,500
example like maybe this can I do with

404
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,820
this glass yeah so you can like imagine

405
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,200
if this glass wasn't clear you could

406
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,270
like put it in the glass and just the

407
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,110
top would be poking out so it's a little

408
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,699
bit covert but it is a big black

409
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,710
rectangle which is troublesome if you

410
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,790
have a hotel room that is entirely white

411
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,920
which we'll get into later fun thing

412
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,660
they make uh yeah this one's a foscam

413
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,630
branded one but I went looking for this

414
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,949
one because I want I think I wanted to

415
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,150
buy another one and I couldn't find

416
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,400
anymore I think they stopped selling it

417
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,709
but I found this other like smaller

418
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,780
version it's not foscam it's the same

419
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:36,060
deal a little twisty head I'll get into

420
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,589
this one later this was but my new one I

421
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,849
haven't

422
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,680
a full review of yet but this one has a

423
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,970
little eye our LEDs on the front and the

424
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,000
switches on the sides you can turn it on

425
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,970
it does night vision same kind of idea

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
the foscam camera has this like app that

427
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,170
you download and it talks I suppose I

428
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,030
could have spent a lot of time on this

429
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,699
because it's basically like serial over

430
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,620
USB I'm guessing and you plug this thing

431
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,680
into the Windows machine it's Windows

432
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,480
only because of course and you have all

433
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,069
these different options and this one's

434
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,110
actually fairly interesting because you

435
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,210
know it's got settings for motion

436
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,850
sensing it's got settings for vibration

437
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,590
like if physically is moved if it

438
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,030
vibrates if it is got an accelerometer

439
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm guessing it'll start to record and

440
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,240
yeah voice it'll trigger on audio and

441
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,430
that's the interesting one so like if

442
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,750
you have it triggering on audio only and

443
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,760
you have it sitting on a desk somewhere

444
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,950
and a lightning storm happens then you

445
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,030
get two hours of a lightning storm and

446
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,000
you're like cool that spent all my

447
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:35,480
battery wonderful so kind of neat the

448
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,630
batteries not the best but like it'll

449
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,250
get 45 minutes of recording that doesn't

450
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,040
mean 45 minutes of lifetime like if it's

451
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,440
on motion sensing once it accumulates

452
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,790
about 45 minutes of recording time then

453
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,000
it'll the battery will probably go out

454
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:53,050
on you not bad this one is the one I've

455
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,250
probably used the most pretty fun stuff

456
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,199
here's a video of me trying to hide it

457
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:02,230
in a hotel I think this I think this was

458
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,640
t2 in Finland last October this was me

459
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,339
actually I think the picture that I take

460
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,400
in this video is later in the talk but

461
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,589
this is me going around the room putting

462
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,010
cameras places for the purpose of taking

463
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,919
pictures of the cameras for the later

464
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:22,069
portion of the talk so not bad decent

465
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,730
light sensitivity high frame rate this

466
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:29,149
is what you expect to see when the thing

467
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,850
does what it's supposed to do this is

468
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,320
the replacement that I found and the

469
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,090
reason that I linked the Amazon page is

470
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,260
because this thing is so janky Chinese

471
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,750
OEM it doesn't even have an official

472
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,670
model name or number

473
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,290
so if you want to buy it like how do I

474
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,030
tell you that it's interesting this one

475
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,889
is cool because it was like $30 this one

476
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:50,480
is fairly inexpensive yeah there are 40

477
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:53,060
bucks this one was like 90 or something

478
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,510
so as far as pricing goes like this was

479
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:58,700
a $500 camera and is not so good and

480
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,070
these things work every time and they're

481
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,370
like 30 bucks and 80 bucks like there's

482
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,409
no this it's a no-brainer

483
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,879
same idea this one has less features you

484
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,140
can't plug a computer into it and

485
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,700
configure all that stuff like in the

486
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,200
other like the other one this one just

487
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,720
has some switches on the side you can

488
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,150
turn the IR LEDs on or off it purports

489
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,890
to have like 500 minutes of recording

490
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,470
time but I haven't had the time to mess

491
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,690
with it yet I left it on in my hotel

492
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,100
room here and I have not reviewed

493
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,570
anything on it so it could have a bunch

494
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,530
of cool stuff on it it could not I'm not

495
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,330
sure I have to check pretty neat like

496
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,639
that's a you know stay tuned I'll tweet

497
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,820
about it or something this next one this

498
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,980
one's pretty neat this this guy a little

499
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,780
bit larger a little we're getting to the

500
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,980
size where they're starting to become

501
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,330
more and more difficult to actually

502
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,390
conceal because this is kind of like a

503
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,129
hockey puck but this one is kind of

504
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,480
burly this one for all the hardware

505
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,280
people in the crowd it's got these

506
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,680
little rubber grommets and if you open

507
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,879
the grommet there's I Oh pins that you

508
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,710
can attach stuff to so if the camera

509
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,080
detects motion and comes to life it'll

510
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,290
like trigger the pins or go 5 volts high

511
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,210
or you can configure it and I have this

512
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,649
actually built into a Halloween thing

513
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,970
that I made a couple years ago to scare

514
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,640
my friends that are like for some reason

515
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,130
deathly afraid of clowns so I built this

516
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,510
into a scary clown and I put this like

517
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,730
in the little cloak under the clown's

518
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,730
head and I drilled the eyes out and put

519
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:26,840
LEDs in and had a audio like an Arduino

520
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,310
with a speaker and a clip from if

521
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,399
anybody's ever played Bioshock is

522
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:34,070
familiar with the like circus of values

523
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,840
yeah that super loud and the idea was

524
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,340
that if the camera came to life and was

525
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,870
triggered the pins would short that

526
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,040
would tell the Arduino to fire and then

527
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,500
the clown would come to life and I would

528
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,180
have video of my friends facial

529
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,590
expression before they came to my house

530
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,470
to kill me because I scared them on the

531
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:50,090
clown this the the face of this thing

532
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,800
there's a little rectangle here this is

533
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,970
one of those infrared motion detectors

534
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,590
that you can turn on or off which is

535
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,690
pretty cool and all this empty space

536
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,399
will get into these are actually IR LEDs

537
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,890
that are illuminators in here so this

538
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,540
does night-vision which is kind of

539
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,650
however it's a little bit bigger a

540
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,990
little bit heavier it has a lot more

541
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,130
battery that's the heft but the

542
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,250
interesting component with this one is

543
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,140
that it doesn't turn the IR LEDs on when

544
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,720
it detects the motion it just keeps them

545
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:18,460
on all the time which murders the

546
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:20,860
battery so interest like janky Chinese

547
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,020
OEM but on the higher end of JK Chinese

548
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,850
OEM these and and and again there's no

549
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,950
there isn't a switch on this one to

550
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,540
control the IR LEDs you got to plug the

551
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,840
stupid app into it and configure it that

552
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,510
way

553
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,459
it's a fun times and these are the extra

554
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,470
options for that bigger version of the

555
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,030
camera so you the PIR trigger is that

556
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,660
little I infrared sensor I mentioned

557
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,309
same idea voice and then you got your

558
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,440
external trigger and your aux trigger

559
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:46,750
out so there's a second set of pins and

560
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,490
you can actually have something tell the

561
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,960
camera to turn on and vice versa you can

562
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,240
have the camera tell something else to

563
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,590
turn on so kind of handy and you can use

564
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,090
it in other applications just kind of

565
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:59,320
fun so here's a video of that I don't

566
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,149
have the audio attached to the laptop

567
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,379
but there's like a buzzing noise that

568
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,059
you can hear and everything is kind of

569
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,920
purple and the reason everything is kind

570
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:09,280
of purple is because the IR LED is on

571
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,720
and again this is another picture that I

572
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,170
took that you will probably see the

573
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,820
picture of later and I think this was I

574
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:19,320
think this was NBT Con in San Francisco

575
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,629
a couple of years ago or maybe last year

576
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,928
yeah so this is a what you get out of

577
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,610
the thing this is me hiding it on a on a

578
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,700
phone

579
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,620
interesting stuff not bad it's a fun

580
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,540
camera I've deployed it before and like

581
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,620
I've had housekeeping staff come in to a

582
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:41,920
two of the room and saying in Spanish oh

583
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,419
look there's a camera so they want one

584
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,590
of the two most interesting things that

585
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,640
I've ever caught so I guess I'm not

586
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,959
interesting enough for people to like

587
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,780
sneak into my room but I guess if I was

588
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,910
then maybe I had bigger problems this

589
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,129
guy this is an interesting one this is

590
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,650
the the biggest of the bunch is kind of

591
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,050
beefy this one is one of the most

592
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,210
interesting cameras because it's

593
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,340
battery-powered B it has that deal where

594
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,110
there's a microphone and a speaker so

595
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,459
like you can like push a button on the

596
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,379
app on your phone and shout on to it and

597
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,900
like you the little tiny voice come out

598
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,030
the back this thing has a camera element

599
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,450
in the front that will move 180 degrees

600
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,010
and you

601
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,320
can remotely control it through the app

602
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,760
over the internet on your phone so you

603
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,110
can say like if somebody's in your hotel

604
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,419
room if you're monitoring an area you

605
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:24,070
can with your thumb pan across the app

606
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:27,610
and it'll actually move the camera

607
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,439
element pretty neat lots of battery that

608
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,449
thing a lasts for like two days that's a

609
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,889
$600 camera which is egregious and

610
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,090
staggeringly expensive for what it is

611
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:35,529
but we'll get into it there's a website

612
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,500
that sells these things that targets

613
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:39,730
like law enforcement people and of

614
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,870
course because they're targeting law

615
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,950
enforcement people they imagine that

616
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,559
those people just have buckets and

617
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,179
buckets of money so this is sort of what

618
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,860
you see this is me I think this was key

619
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:50,500
B con yeah key week on this is in New

620
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,740
Zealand me leaving my hotel room and

621
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,120
that thing capturing the the me leaving

622
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,710
and then on the right there's that's the

623
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,969
app I'm talking about you can like drag

624
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,870
your thumb around and it moves the thing

625
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,649
it's pretty neat you can adjust like

626
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,120
picture settings and things like that

627
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,850
you can flip it and rotate it so if you

628
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,959
need to like stand it on its side or

629
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,340
glue it to the bottom of a table or

630
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,809
something like that to hide it like you

631
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,519
can you have some options they were just

632
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:14,200
kind of cool so getting into like the

633
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,549
placement of these things because now

634
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,990
you know what they look like they're all

635
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:19,120
black they're big in their square and

636
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,320
now you've seen them now everyone is

637
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,510
gonna be able to recognize well that's a

638
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,639
hidden camera and it's a janky one like

639
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,289
I am NOT an intelligence agency I don't

640
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:27,639
have access to the ant catalog I don't

641
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:29,110
have like a whole fuzz farm or a whole

642
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,090
team of people developing stuff for me

643
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,969
I'm I'm just a dinky tiny person and I

644
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,799
have to buy my spy crap on Amazon so or

645
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,269
brickHouse Security which man when we

646
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:41,289
get to I hope you actually have drinks

647
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:43,600
so speaking to where to place these

648
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,370
things in a hotel room that is mostly

649
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,918
white in San Francisco where on earth

650
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,018
can you put one of these cameras well I

651
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,059
don't have a whole lot of time so I'll

652
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,279
go through this very quickly but I've

653
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,678
hidden it in the shadow underneath the

654
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,960
table fairly decent but when you get too

655
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,830
close like if they go looking it's not

656
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,630
super sneaky to that end like maybe you

657
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,158
have to get creative maybe putting it in

658
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,870
just an oak or a cranny or putting it on

659
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,539
something in the room isn't the best

660
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,239
because the room just isn't made for

661
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:16,000
being able to hide this giant thing the

662
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,669
big black shiny box so maybe you know

663
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,799
you hide it somewhere a little bit more

664
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:23,260
clever like gaff taping it to the bottom

665
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,730
of a table which to that end if you're

666
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,000
not traveling with a roll of gaffers

667
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,500
tape

668
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,040
you should probably travel with a roll

669
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,480
of gaffer

670
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,610
because you can do weird things like

671
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,260
gluing a wireless at a wireless

672
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,760
interface with an antenna to the outside

673
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,250
of your hotel room window and aiming it

674
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,679
at a customer or other fun ridiculous

675
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,880
things like this like gluing a table to

676
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,740
the bar or blue I'm sorry

677
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,309
yet gluing a table to the top of a

678
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,870
camera or vice versa right so to that

679
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:47,980
end also here's one this one was I

680
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,299
thought I thought this one was very

681
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,940
clever I was proud of this one where's

682
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,559
the camera here you're looking at snow

683
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,610
there's no gaffers tape I can't hide it

684
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,410
aha interesting an actual practical

685
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,510
application for this tiny little camera

686
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,549
just we have a two hour window in which

687
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,900
we we in which we want the shenanigans

688
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:09,100
to happen so interesting thing there

689
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,200
another one there's another same hotel

690
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,059
room where did I put the camera it's

691
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,510
hiding can you see it

692
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,440
maybe I stuck it behind the phone so

693
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,700
yeah I got it you gotta get a little

694
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,960
clever with these sorts of things and

695
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,679
you have to like flex your camouflage

696
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,820
muscles in this case I actually this one

697
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,200
should be familiar because this was in

698
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,470
one of the videos I actually put the

699
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,450
camera right on top of the phone but

700
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,980
from like five paces away you'd never

701
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,200
know you have to be looking for it right

702
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,570
it's just right in the open unless

703
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,590
you're looking with a mobile phone

704
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:41,200
because one of the things that you can

705
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,240
do to detect if there is like janky

706
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,340
Chinese OEM cameras somebody bought off

707
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,960
I'm like an air B&B for example like

708
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,668
sneaky cameras whatever you aim your

709
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,780
phone at it if you aim your phone at it

710
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:53,500
you're like hey look infrared

711
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:57,610
illuminators it's plain as day but yeah

712
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,919
it'll murder your battery so what did I

713
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,780
do here it becomes obvious cuz like you

714
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,120
can see it on the phone why is the phone

715
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,530
emitting a light like why is the phone

716
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,439
in the hotel room emitting infrared

717
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,970
light that's probably a dead giveaway so

718
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,490
to that end like where can you hide

719
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,910
these things in this case I hid one up

720
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,799
there which that's not bad it might fall

721
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,299
if somebody goes into your room they

722
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,580
won't see it it'll get the back of their

723
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:23,620
head which may not be the best but if

724
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,540
they're leaving they might and the other

725
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,639
risk that you face with these cameras is

726
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,260
if somebody sees them because a lot of

727
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,630
these are not networked they could just

728
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,860
take them and now somebody's been in

729
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,350
your hotel room and now they've stolen

730
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,299
your camera and you're like well crap so

731
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:39,399
there's that to consider in this case

732
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:40,250
this one is fairly obvious it's right

733
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,450
there

734
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,700
so good this that there's a practical

735
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,200
application of the little of DIY version

736
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,100
of the camera which is kind of cool

737
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,870
here's my ultra covert job of hiding it

738
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,699
on the back of the hotel room door with

739
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,310
a bunch of gaffers tape and running a

740
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,720
USB line across the open doorway to a

741
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,040
table where I have a big battery pack

742
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,350
that I'm sure nobody will notice if they

743
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,510
open as it falls on the floor and lands

744
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,179
and slides totally covert super secret

745
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,650
there's that la mate PV 500 W that's

746
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,330
gaff taped to the back of the thing

747
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,640
which is a little bit better because it

748
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,990
has its own battery but again it doesn't

749
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,700
really do motion sensing and it doesn't

750
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,380
talk to the internet so you would have

751
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,790
to go retrieve the video off the thing

752
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,860
when you're done with it which may not

753
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,770
be the best and to that end now that

754
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:27,379
I've shown you some examples of where to

755
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,600
put cameras I will show you where not to

756
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,250
put cameras in this case it is very

757
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,020
obvious that that is a thing because

758
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,930
when you look at that that looks

759
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,490
horrible and out of place putting it in

760
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,890
plain sight and not doing a good job

761
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,920
also just know you're not doing it

762
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,640
correctly now you're just being stupid

763
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,310
just stop it

764
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,440
that one also not so good like why are

765
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,490
there and of envelopes hovering above

766
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,160
the surface that they're sitting on

767
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,020
that's super obvious that one's actually

768
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,060
not bad black on black on black you

769
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,889
might be able to get away with that

770
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,720
no what are you doing stop it no don't

771
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,360
hide your $500 camera in the coffee

772
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,430
machine you're not gonna have a good

773
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,550
time especially if they decide to run

774
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,900
the coffee machine deciding to put the

775
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,940
screw attachment on it to disguise that

776
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,960
of the screw is also not going to help

777
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,220
you in this scenario stop just just know

778
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,280
also if you want to denial-of-service

779
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,560
yourself get a hotel room right in front

780
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,090
of the elevator doors and a deploy your

781
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,350
camera that does talk the internet and

782
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,449
does do motion sensing in front of the

783
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,280
doors and then spend literally the next

784
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,260
three hours getting your phone buzz to

785
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,700
every 10 seconds because every time the

786
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,110
elevator doors move or every time

787
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,370
somebody walks by your hotel room door

788
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,760
that thing will fire and your phone will

789
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,800
get blooped and it will send you a photo

790
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,140
and to that end the insanity continues

791
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,270
because they will also sell you a six

792
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,230
hundred and forty nine dollar

793
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,790
surveillance bucket

794
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:52,050
I didn't know you could buy a

795
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:53,490
surveillance bucket but great supposedly

796
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,370
the use case scenario for your

797
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,960
surveillance bucket is to put in like a

798
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,560
construction site to see if people are

799
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,080
stealing things but like you can get

800
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,929
this one for 30 bucks and do the same

801
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,330
thing like okay yeah and I'm fairly

802
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,850
certain that that it's a security bucket

803
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,560
has one of these in it and this was like

804
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,879
a hundred dollars or a hundred and fifty

805
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,440
dollars or something like that so I

806
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,060
don't know I I guess that's like full of

807
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,100
lead acid batteries too so I imagine

808
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,240
getting that delivered and if that's not

809
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,610
interesting enough you can also have a

810
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,320
surveillance rock here's a rock it's a

811
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,300
five hundred dollar rock and with a

812
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,800
camera in it and I'm sure it's certainly

813
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,379
just one of these that's embedded in the

814
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,940
thing so there's the thing to remember

815
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,440
about these products is that they exist

816
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,610
because there's a market for them they

817
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,950
wouldn't make these things that people

818
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,990
didn't buy them so if the surveillance

819
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,610
rock isn't good enough and you're you

820
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,310
want to surveil a bunch of nerds maybe

821
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,949
you get a $300 surveillance Monster

822
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:48,300
Energy Drink same sort of idea it's just

823
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,730
a one of these little cameras and the

824
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,159
battery packed into a can but yeah 300

825
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,540
bucks for my and then if that's not good

826
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,460
enough they actually make one that's a

827
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,930
bottle of Mountain Dew and the mountain

828
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,190
dew like there's liquid on the top and

829
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,750
the bottom so that that actually looks

830
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,000
like it's a bottle of Mountain Dew same

831
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,480
sort of a yeah 300 all about money yeah

832
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,670
yeah not so good

833
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,840
I want one thought as they were just

834
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,690
doing it to see who would buy it

835
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,830
another is whatever but I'm not spending

836
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,830
six hundred and fifty dollars on a

837
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,149
camera bucket so to that end for a lot

838
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,639
of these things to work you have to end

839
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,840
you have to deploy a network you have to

840
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,610
have a network for these things to talk

841
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,649
to so before I bought my GLI net slate

842
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,590
router which is fantastic I was using a

843
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,030
hack five pineapple Nano and that thing

844
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,800
has multiple wireless interfaces one

845
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,500
talks to the hotel captive portal the

846
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,780
other one talks to your stuff and your

847
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,790
network comes to life and you can you

848
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,670
can do things but the drawback with the

849
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,590
the Nano is it only talks 2.4 gigahertz

850
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,750
so if the hotel Wi-Fi network that

851
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:47,610
you're attaching to does doesn't do 2 4

852
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:52,320
which is actually starting to happen

853
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:54,389
because it's 2019 or or be you need more

854
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,070
bandwidth this thing is not the fastest

855
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,930
in the world and if you want to stream

856
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,189
video you can knock this thing over and

857
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,760
it will break and things I got so I

858
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,050
spent

859
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,900
sixty-five dollars and bought this guy

860
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,550
and this is ridiculous leave it like for

861
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,270
any of you any Wi-Fi hackers in the room

862
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:11,700
this thing has to a throws chips a 2.45

863
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:16,020
gig interface it runs open wrt out of

864
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,180
the box and it's got a ridiculous amount

865
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,710
of power and utility it's got three gig

866
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,660
interfaces and it's designed to have

867
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,470
like a 4G modem plugged into its USB

868
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:28,740
port so very very awesome this is like

869
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:32,040
my new favorite and this is the way that

870
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:36,200
I architect my hotel or travel wireless

871
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,850
network so I have my various bizarre

872
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,040
trinkets attached to my mitten based

873
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,889
networking device talking to the shitty

874
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,720
hotel captive Wi-Fi or my phone and then

875
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,910
the obvious Bechet insanity that is the

876
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,050
internet to complete our hilarious

877
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,710
infrastructure for surveilling your own

878
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:58,050
hotel room on on a budget so that being

879
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,340
the calf or that being the case there is

880
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,230
a little bit of OPSEC that you have to

881
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,459
consider with regards to deploying this

882
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,570
equipment like I said if somebody

883
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,740
actually does gain access to your room

884
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,419
and they see one of these cameras they

885
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,100
can just take it and walk away and then

886
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,060
your your bone now you know that there

887
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,030
was somebody in your room but you have

888
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,950
no idea what they did or watch your

889
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:17,610
background because pertaining to certain

890
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,810
laws depending on who gets filmed one

891
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,159
thing to consider is that if you do

892
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,649
catch a bunch of stuff on your camera

893
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,480
then it's sort of unenforceable because

894
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,100
unless you share the video that nobody

895
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,620
knows you have the video so that's that

896
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,459
to consider but Treach you need to check

897
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,169
your placement and if you're gonna

898
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,610
deploy cameras deploy more than one and

899
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,080
you want aim them kind of at each other

900
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,909
you want the fire sectors of the cameras

901
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,350
to include the other cameras so if one

902
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,150
camera fires you have checked the video

903
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,649
on all of them because if somebody gains

904
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:42,660
access to your hotel room and steals one

905
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,850
of your cameras maybe another camera

906
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,200
caught them so it's like triple and

907
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,830
quadruple redundancy so that's something

908
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,540
to consider imagine like a top-down

909
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,820
coverage map you want to look at like a

910
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,230
floor plan and decide - how - it's

911
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,530
fairly easy in a hotel room because I

912
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,450
tend to be a square but yeah and again

913
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,620
you have one with one camera trips you

914
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,380
have to review the video for all of them

915
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:05,850
then I have a sort of wish list because

916
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,100
having done this a lot I have I'm

917
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,100
demanding I'm a demanding whiny baby

918
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,070
about this stuff and I would love at for

919
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,870
the cameras that talk to the Internet

920
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,759
to have like an actual interface that

921
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,018
can aim a web browser at because it

922
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:20,240
would be really nice then I have to plug

923
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,340
a Windows box in and like since I run a

924
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,730
Mac I can't plug a Windows box in I have

925
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,259
to spin up a VM to use that silly app to

926
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:31,159
talk to the camera and it's a bizarre

927
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:32,480
obtuse thing but p2p also seems pretty

928
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,460
shady the way that these things work is

929
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,500
like they talk p2p out to something on

930
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,880
the internet and then your phone and I'm

931
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,259
sure that there's some exploitable

932
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,429
nonsense that can go on there I have not

933
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,019
taken the time to look into that but I'm

934
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:45,259
sure that if I looked it just be bananas

935
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:47,570
ridiculous but yeah more polish would be

936
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:49,370
really nice and maybe a camera like I if

937
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,019
I had a wish list I would add the

938
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,758
ability to have like GPS in the camera

939
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:54,379
which you would think that's bizarre

940
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,750
but I would like to know if my camera

941
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:58,129
gets up and walks away so if the camera

942
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,139
gets up and walks away I would like it

943
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:01,969
to like maybe catch fire or something I

944
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:03,379
don't know that being the case I'm

945
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,940
actually a few minutes over ordinarily I

946
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,529
would do QA but I'm gonna get out of the

947
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,549
way so that the conference organizers

948
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:09,199
should you can do their thing please

949
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,550
look me up or find me somewhere and ask

950
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,319
me questions I'm happy to share the toys

951
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,060
and have you look around thank you very

952
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,489
much for letting me rant about cameras

953
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:20,328
on stage

954
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:20,329
[Applause]
