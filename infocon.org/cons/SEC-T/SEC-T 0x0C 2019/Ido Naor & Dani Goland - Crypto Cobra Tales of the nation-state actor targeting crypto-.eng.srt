1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,770
hello everyone thank you for having us

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:13,399
again in Sweden as Mattias said my name

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,308
is IDO and here with me is Danny a

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,500
little bit about the the presentation

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,120
that we're going to do today we're going

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,170
to talk about the North Korean threat

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:26,590
actor and how they shift from I mean

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,900
they still are targeting financial

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,340
institutions but also found a big trend

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,620
around cryptocurrency you're probably

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,519
heard about it and we're going to cover

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:41,149
a lot of it and also have a small debate

13
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:44,269
between the two of us so a little bit

14
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,999
about us as we set our names but we are

15
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:50,149
also the founders of virus Bay is anyone

16
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:53,210
familiar with this name virus Bay Wow

17
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,889
amazing last year it's like everyone

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,739
from everyone is familiar with virus Bay

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:01:03,859
one people one person is like and those

20
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:06,560
are friend from Israel yeah so I'm a

21
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:09,289
researcher the a team called the great

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,789
global research and analysis team forty

23
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:13,850
people around the world part of

24
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:17,659
Kaspersky Lab hunting for the major

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,479
threat actors and interesting campaigns

26
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,719
I'm CTO and alpha financial systems were

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,299
company does different financial

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:28,969
instruments for low liquidity markets

29
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:31,130
I've also an alumni and a lecturer in a

30
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:34,369
college called college of management in

31
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:36,219
Israel one of the biggest I was a

32
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:41,570
student of Berkeley on a guy apparently

33
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:44,119
driving here I have a father of three

34
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,600
daughters and then is active on two in

35
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,460
their 4x4 research it's for research so

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,630
we do have we do have common grounds

37
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,199
there

38
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,548
I mean his babies are unknown like we

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,429
don't know where they are specifically

40
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,969
but he got some and we're both from

41
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:05,030
Israel so let's begin with the talk a

42
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,149
little recap about about the crypto

43
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,960
hacks so we know they started around

44
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:14,300
2011 and there was a lot of major ones

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,730
listed here before you and also we have

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,620
those in red who are

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,720
tribute to the apt actor we are going to

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,690
talk about today their name is Lazarus

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,190
hidden Cobra and other type of names

50
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,010
we're going to focus on a unit called

51
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,709
apt 38 or blue north as they're called

52
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,730
what the ones who are actually after

53
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:35,049
financial gain

54
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:37,420
so in 2019 they didn't left out the

55
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:39,069
cryptocurrency we have the bit hum I

56
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,849
don't know if you're familiar with that

57
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:48,640
story another keeper hack that they were

58
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:51,420
involved in this recent year all right

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,208
I'll take that all right

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,440
so pretty recently we had a debate we

61
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,140
were talking about we were looking at

62
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,810
all the evidence we have from Lazarus

63
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,170
and blue north and we were thinking okay

64
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:08,109
every year this is getting worse wasn't

65
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,849
being 2020 so in my opinion after

66
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:13,180
looking at all the new regulation coming

67
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,649
out and there was a lot and I will word

68
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,450
that hot today you know the technical

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,579
hat Ito will talk about most of the

70
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,649
samples and evidence we found yeah I'll

71
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:23,230
talk about most of the new regulation

72
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:28,090
around crypto exchanges so you get the

73
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,459
debate will it grow or will it stop so

74
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,760
think yeah so who thinks it will keep

75
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:37,150
getting worse

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,910
people come on power to Lazarus they're

77
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,500
gonna keep attacking crypto currency

78
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:46,870
dude it's an apt it keeps on always find

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,030
always make money okay

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,829
I mean so my region was the harder you

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,620
make it we look I look at it as a

82
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,599
two-stage operation you have to steal

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,389
the money still the bitcoins and then

84
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,709
you have to cash out stealing it will

85
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:01,680
probably stay the same

86
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:05,049
new exploits are discovered every day

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,639
spearfishing always works but cashing

88
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,709
out can get harder if you have a lot of

89
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,299
sanctions if you can't just take a

90
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,970
hundred or a thousand bitcoins and

91
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,129
convert them to US dollars you're kind

92
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,410
of screwed like you stole virtual

93
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:20,349
currency which you can I mean you're not

94
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,440
gonna pay a scientist with between right

95
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,580
if you're North Korea I mean not only

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,389
crypto currency related like the

97
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,719
Bangladesh incident you know 951 million

98
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:33,569
dollars which ended up in what 60 yes

99
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:35,580
you know so I got up in like 20 in their

100
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:37,469
pocket exactly my paint the harder you

101
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,050
make it to cash out the less incentive

102
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:42,240
they have to work that hard to steal the

103
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,860
money and maybe go find new ventures

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,249
I'm just hoping with the debate so we'll

105
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,270
have a few odds you know but so a couple

106
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:52,830
of days ago September 13 the US Treasury

107
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,219
effect the Treasury Office of Foreign

108
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,889
Assets Control put some sanctions on

109
00:04:56,219 --> 00:05:01,319
three North Korean groups Lazarus and

110
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:02,939
Janelle and boo North which we're

111
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,129
talking about today

112
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,319
regular sanctions the if you're

113
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:11,009
affiliated in anywhere in the world or

114
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:14,490
your bank that owns any money to belongs

115
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:17,129
to it they can freeze the assets will we

116
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:20,069
see any impact from it in my opinion we

117
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,039
want but the more interesting thing is

118
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,560
the fast travel rule which came out I

119
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,599
will have a whole slide about it but we

120
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,830
see that crypto exchanges are already

121
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:35,610
starting to delete different coins so ok

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,948
XD listed of their privacy coins so like

123
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,710
Manero and other like coins are more

124
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:42,779
focused on privacy than are untraceable

125
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,210
so when that happens I mean for a group

126
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,580
like Lazarus or Boone or if they wanna

127
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,989
really take the Bitcoin they usually

128
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,899
want to convert it to a different

129
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,270
currency maybe have a product usually a

130
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,759
private coin and one biggest changes

131
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,680
started listening them they can't cash

132
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,819
out they have nowhere to convert it to a

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:07,589
fiat currency give me the clicker

134
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:10,110
Wow okay that's enough you can go let's

135
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:12,210
go down the rabbit hole so before we go

136
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,789
down into technical stuff I was thinking

137
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,438
about doing some small timeline to just

138
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,568
give you an overview of how they are

139
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,479
shifting into cryptocurrency I know it's

140
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,669
not like the entire landscape and there

141
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,669
is not like all the stories but it's

142
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,289
enough what we have here is enough for

143
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,289
you to understand like how they are

144
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,259
rolling their stuff so taking back from

145
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,649
like going back to mid 17 we had like a

146
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:40,169
big casino which you know was spear

147
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,040
fished and at the end of the at the end

148
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,349
of the incident

149
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,910
at the final stages there was a drop of

150
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,180
a tool that called

151
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,540
that his name is manuscript manuscript

152
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,700
is like a takeover a type tool that is

153
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,310
related to Lazarus was attributed to

154
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,270
Lazarus also back in the days and this

155
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,490
is the like the first stage of them

156
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:06,000
attacking places which are basically

157
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,620
online the other one was very

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,250
interesting still not related to

159
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,040
cryptocurrency however the decoy was

160
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,420
related it was a dhikr which had like a

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:21,500
blockchain type venture in the in the

162
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,410
document and it's some sort of a

163
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:29,730
indicator if you if you look from from a

164
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:31,860
bird view then 2018 not related to blue

165
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,830
North but does related to North Korea

166
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,290
was Kim Suki who elevated the North

167
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,200
Korean summits in order to attack one of

168
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:45,600
the crypto currency exchanges and used

169
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:49,050
the same tool menu script afterwards me

170
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,260
the 18th we've seen another another

171
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,720
attack this time was elevating an open

172
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,370
SSL vulnerability the libraries was

173
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,500
actually replaced with the original

174
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,940
libraries which eventually ended up with

175
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,460
the supply chain attack on a crypto

176
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,440
currency dropping another variant of the

177
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,250
manuscript called fault chill also

178
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,460
attributed to Lazarus keeping the going

179
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,650
and there was a major release that we

180
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,969
had and Kaspersky it's called apple

181
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,270
juice you've probably heard about it

182
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:22,500
it's the attack will which involved also

183
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,140
like Mac samples alongside Microsoft

184
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,670
related samples that is because we

185
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,890
believe that Lazarus or apt actors

186
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,680
understood that a lot of these crypto

187
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,799
currency exchange companies are using

188
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:42,120
Mac as well or only Mac's so they

189
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,890
shifted to Mac malware as well and we

190
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,200
can see that the manuscript is still

191
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,260
ongoing although it got a new name with

192
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,360
some extensions that's named threat

193
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,880
needle that's like a like the big

194
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,810
brother of manuscript and as I said two

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,720
of those incidents

196
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,920
and the last one from apple juice and a

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,080
recent one that we were going to talk

198
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:08,400
about in this in this talk are both had

199
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,960
Mac and Windows variants so that's

200
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,790
interesting but let's go deeper into the

201
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,850
rabbit hole as I said we were here end

202
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:20,060
of nineteen and we want to have some

203
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:26,270
sort of decision making between our

204
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:30,869
debating subjects so a quick round of

205
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:37,170
information around apple juice so there

206
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:41,160
was this decoy update of our software

207
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:44,219
which was called Seles limited some sort

208
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,900
of a trading app in this incident we

209
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,140
were called to do an incident response

210
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,360
I've heard the last talk was referring

211
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,480
to Incident Response so part of our

212
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,240
research is also that we found some

213
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,000
major ICS over there encryption keys

214
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,850
which were used in the past and some

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,180
sort of a communication which was very

216
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,410
familiar to us some things to talk about

217
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,859
the communication I don't know if you

218
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:14,969
see it but there is like mime type named

219
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,940
juice which why the name was originally

220
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:22,620
what why the operation named apple juice

221
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:24,810
and over here you have amazing so over

222
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,730
here we have a gif header but basically

223
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,380
this is not a gift okay this is

224
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,360
encrypted content from the victim

225
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,760
machine and was encrypted with the key

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,339
which was behind just a few seconds ago

227
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:42,000
and this was would be sent to the c2 for

228
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:44,700
further investigation default chill the

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,990
sixteen byte key which decrypts the the

230
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:52,110
major DLL and drops the take over to

231
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,070
eventually we found it in that incident

232
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:58,500
as well which you know linked back to

233
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:03,060
Lazarus some more interesting details

234
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,339
were the RCA the ours rc4 key which was

235
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,680
also found in the incident was used in

236
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,209
previous attacks of Lazarus

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:17,579
we tried to hunt down sell us and we

238
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:20,939
ended up finding company with with an

239
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:24,359
address in some field in Netherlands so

240
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:27,300
based on those results we we understood

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,629
that it's a fake company and it's maybe

242
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:37,248
something that we will see again in

243
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:41,100
future in future attacks the fall Chile

244
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:44,939
the for Chile's sample was overlapped

245
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,879
with other samples of Lazarus using same

246
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,339
SI toos from previous attacks also

247
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:55,589
things that helped us understand and of

248
00:11:50,339 --> 00:12:00,329
course the most interesting one was KO

249
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:04,259
KP korean language found also in one of

250
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:06,599
the communication patterns and so this

251
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,059
was in 2018 when we released at the end

252
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,990
of the 2018 and then we had another

253
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:17,699
incident investigated related also to

254
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:21,300
Lazarus the sample themselves we saw we

255
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:25,349
saw starting development around November

256
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,439
of 18 and it was interesting because it

257
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,839
had the same pattern of having Mac and

258
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:32,819
Windows as well another interesting

259
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,079
thing that we saw was the fact that they

260
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:40,199
had two different types of c2 servers

261
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:45,449
and I'll go I'll go into that in just a

262
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:48,329
few minutes they are actually faking

263
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,758
WordPress links to make the traffic look

264
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:53,899
legitimate we'll also see that in a few

265
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,819
seconds and then we found the powershell

266
00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:00,499
which is also a major part of this talk

267
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:03,269
as well and their activity I think that

268
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:08,600
what what they have in mind is actually

269
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,600
moving from you know old-school type

270
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,569
take over to actually using extensive

271
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,329
powershell scripts that can there are

272
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,460
fully fledged with everything you need

273
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,910
in order to take off tokyo take over a

274
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:27,320
victim machine this attack specifically

275
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,350
was on south korean entity however we

276
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,250
know that blue nor office worldwide

277
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,220
because we're just focusing on

278
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:37,430
cryptocurrency here another interesting

279
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,990
part and maybe the last part is the fact

280
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,819
that they are ready for redundancy they

281
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,500
have hot patches for their malware in

282
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,150
cases where the mail won't won't work

283
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,020
the way they want so they have hot

284
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:53,240
patches ready we found them either you

285
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:58,490
know on multi scanners or in the

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:01,490
incident itself so when going down into

287
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,940
the incident itself we saw the macro you

288
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:09,010
can see it here it was very obvious in

289
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:16,420
the awp hwp hun-gu

290
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:19,550
d-- hangeul documents and within that

291
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,680
macro we can see right from the

292
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,140
beginning that there is a condition

293
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,770
there and the condition itself says like

294
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,449
if mac then so we understood that there

295
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:33,319
was supposed to be something else other

296
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,270
than mac and here's the mac and else we

297
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,280
can also see like there is some sort of

298
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,699
an environment which you know is trying

299
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,040
to formulate some PS one which is the

300
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,950
powershell and we could also identify

301
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,689
like the environment with the temp which

302
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,990
is related to windows so we know that

303
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,450
side at the left side is related to mac

304
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,360
while you know the right side is related

305
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,190
to windows and we can see that there are

306
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,040
some differences some interesting

307
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,820
differences so for example we can see

308
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,670
that underneath the the line of if mac

309
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,310
we can see the HTTP going to the c2 to

310
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,979
actually download the sample in case

311
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:16,250
it's a mac and then change or modify the

312
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,850
permissions and install the malicious

313
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,649
app on the machine versus windows where

314
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,220
they leverage the

315
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:29,119
PowerShell to actually evade some

316
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,059
Microsoft protections and execute the

317
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:33,589
PowerShell

318
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,509
if you look for a bird view we can see

319
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,480
that there is a macro weaponized

320
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:41,600
document after that there is an OS

321
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,029
checking and after the always checking

322
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,860
there is a decision-making and there

323
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:48,350
create and execute if it's a power if

324
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,649
it's a Windows or fetch from a remote

325
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:54,879
server which we just saw so if we look

326
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:57,889
at the extensiveness I'd say of the

327
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,829
PowerShell script we can see that they

328
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:02,149
actually took care of everything this

329
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:04,309
parasol script is much longer than what

330
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,559
it's looking here but just to give you

331
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:10,639
an overview of the global variables so

332
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:12,889
the first one is actually 1 or 0 to exit

333
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,529
the malware the other one is just a

334
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,290
buffer for the response coming from the

335
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,319
c2 server a list of the c2 servers and

336
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,248
some global function which was used for

337
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:27,679
the actual takeover if we look at the

338
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:29,629
post over here which is kind of

339
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,079
different from the one we saw on apple

340
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:35,389
juice we still can see some small

341
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:39,109
similarities with the user agent being

342
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:43,850
and hard-coded and the comments that are

343
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:47,600
being sent which are proprietary for for

344
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:50,720
that attack and we can see a yellow the

345
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:59,569
web includes which fake ins or fakes

346
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:01,339
sorry the WordPress if we look at the

347
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:04,428
functionality of the two we talked about

348
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:05,949
the PowerShell so we see that it's kind

349
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,990
of extensive like you can do almost

350
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:10,579
anything like starting from collecting

351
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,309
basic host information to check the

352
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,709
malware status and download and upload

353
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,928
files and execute system commands that's

354
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,760
like the perfect tool well not yet

355
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,899
because they actually improve this but

356
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,939
to be honest from investigating these

357
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:27,948
type of tools we can see you know what's

358
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:31,760
standing on the other side of the river

359
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:33,139
and we will kind of well I won't say

360
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,200
worried because you know that's our job

361
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:37,520
but we're kind of

362
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,230
enthusiasts you know waiting for the

363
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,300
next incident waiting to see how they

364
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,950
will improve their tools waiting to see

365
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,470
what's missing in their toolset

366
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,810
they are gonna shift into I don't know

367
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,930
downloading an additional sample are

368
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,850
they gonna exploit a new CVE or the are

369
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,700
they gonna find a new zero-day and then

370
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,560
you know we're gonna find it in and

371
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,150
understand like why are the shifting

372
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,760
that way are they're shifting to

373
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:05,120
cryptocurrency or it's just a decoy you

374
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,670
know they have an interesting way of

375
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,739
using wipers they're using rent

376
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,080
somewhere for wipers did anyone never

377
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,810
heard about it the only one haven't

378
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,850
heard about the incident in Asia where

379
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:19,399
they attacked the bank and inside one of

380
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,139
the samples they had a ransomware ready

381
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,780
to launch just to wipe everything out

382
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:28,670
before they leave so that's a true story

383
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:32,290
they attempted to to steal $1,000,000

384
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,780
from that bank it was stopped with the

385
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,659
assistance of incident responders over

386
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,820
there however they had the hair mass

387
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,530
ransomware just waiting for them to wipe

388
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,500
everything so it's really interesting to

389
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:50,000
see how these guys are attacking the

390
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,710
victims we set up we said that the there

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,010
is a segregation between the c2 servers

392
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,720
so they have servers which they purchase

393
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,300
just like you and me and they have

394
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,780
compromised web servers just like you

395
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,180
and me

396
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,610
right now you don't compromise servers

397
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,430
for fun okay I was just checking if

398
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,740
you're awake okay so they have both of

399
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:12,260
these and both of these are for for

400
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,350
different reasons so ever and a very

401
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,050
smart reason they don't want to lose

402
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:20,600
their builders so there is a builder

403
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,200
which is an executable file that

404
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,659
generates the samples the samples will

405
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,430
eventually reach the victims the

406
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,160
builders they keep for themselves to

407
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,740
keep generating more malware and these

408
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,410
ones they don't want you to have them or

409
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,850
us I mean we do have them but they don't

410
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:43,700
know so don't say anything Ollie do so

411
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,070
it's it's pretty genius you know just to

412
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,570
have that type of segregation between

413
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,840
the servers

414
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:54,500
and the compromised servers are used for

415
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,340
distribution as I said another thing

416
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,960
well that's just just an example of how

417
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,330
they weaponized the hangeul word

418
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,650
processor like the office equivalent for

419
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:09,730
for Korea so this is one example Luffy's

420
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:13,130
which is a venture blockchain venture

421
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,740
based in China and this was a decoy

422
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,350
document a real one from the scene that

423
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,670
was sent to one of the employees and

424
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,580
when he clicked it it actually

425
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:27,070
downloaded the sample infected the

426
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:30,949
machine and this is another interesting

427
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,919
decoy document of coin information about

428
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,620
a company located in the region that had

429
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:42,940
all their right information in place for

430
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,939
the victim to actually click the macro

431
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,900
in terms of overlap this is something

432
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,660
that we do all the time in order to

433
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,790
understand whether this attack is linked

434
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,530
to other attacks and over here the

435
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:58,760
windows sample was the one that actually

436
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:00,830
helped us to to link everything and I'll

437
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:06,470
show you within a very simplistic way in

438
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,870
just a second but going from down up we

439
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,840
can see the windows sample here for

440
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,810
those of you on other side yeah we can

441
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,480
see here the windows I've never had this

442
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:22,370
when I was a kid my mom didn't allow me

443
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:25,490
so two things one export function okay

444
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:30,110
which is here here you're moving your

445
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:32,000
heads that's crazy I'm kidding so export

446
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,490
function the check self export function

447
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,980
one of the major functions which you

448
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,830
know we found in other related samples

449
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:44,930
of Lazarus and an internal name which

450
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:47,929
names Barrow 64 or 33 32 depends on the

451
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,690
operating system and it linked to other

452
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:54,530
samples which originally came from the

453
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:58,220
hwp the Hangu word processor document

454
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:00,260
which led us to understand that this

455
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,870
Windows executable is X

456
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,090
helping us to connect between previous

457
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:07,489
attacks and the powershell and Mac

458
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,529
malware which we saw in the incident so

459
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,269
we have what what I said was about the

460
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,980
check self in the battle and some

461
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,200
similarities in the communication if you

462
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,179
remember I mentioned and on the other

463
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,980
side we have the same on sting servers

464
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:21,679
and network communication and vector

465
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,190
functions that helps us to overlap

466
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:29,389
everything and to understand that it's

467
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:32,000
similar to other attacks regarding the

468
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:36,620
manuscript the way to detect the

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,899
manuscript dropping from the AWP is in

470
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,500
the following order and malicious AWP

471
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,330
sample hwp sample has the crafted image

472
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,909
to trigger the vulnerability the

473
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:50,629
vulnerability is a known one in a place

474
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:53,299
called the post script so the malicious

475
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:56,330
spot script is executed and it runs the

476
00:22:53,299 --> 00:23:00,110
shellcode once the shellcode is ran and

477
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:02,870
downloads the the payload it will do a

478
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,639
number of routines on that payload but

479
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:08,178
it will eventually drop the manuscript

480
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:10,129
back tour and this is basically a

481
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:13,730
detection system that we have internally

482
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:17,539
just for that incident actually this one

483
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:19,700
is well it's like a few months old but

484
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:23,960
it's already outdated because they are

485
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,610
like shifting to new tools the last

486
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,539
thing we're going to talk about it in

487
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:33,850
another attack which is happened just

488
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:36,889
recently so I told you how they attack

489
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,590
financial institutions and the crypto

490
00:23:36,889 --> 00:23:42,559
currency exchanges so we had a number of

491
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,470
incidents in different countries and we

492
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,269
also had fingerprints in other countries

493
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,450
as well however the links are not very

494
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:54,080
well laid out that we can actually

495
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:57,789
attribute it so we have those on like on

496
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,539
the right hand side that we can be sure

497
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:05,029
that it's related to blue nor off

498
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:06,980
starting from the fact of the PowerShell

499
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,039
that we found this is actually a recycle

500
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,690
from 2018 I don't know if anyone read

501
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:15,960
the vietname insert read

502
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,019
of Red Bank the Chilean bank attack

503
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,629
anyone saw it

504
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:23,629
no one is bored is me no okay

505
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,049
so they published some document

506
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,998
regarding attack from lazaros on a

507
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,190
Chilean bank and we will do like a

508
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:34,200
flashback to that attack so we will see

509
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:38,399
it it's actually interesting like in one

510
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,859
slide this payload that you're looking

511
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:43,199
at is actually containing at

512
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:46,769
base64-encoded it's right here it's a

513
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,409
little blurry but it's a base64 encoded

514
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:51,840
executable and the PowerShell over here

515
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:53,909
is actually part of an open-source tool

516
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,658
called power sploit a very known one and

517
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:59,570
a very similar one to to another tool

518
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:03,629
that allow servers is being used is

519
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:09,899
using and also used in the attack on the

520
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:17,099
on the chilean bank two main techniques

521
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:19,978
that blue north are using first on on

522
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,649
the left on the right sorry on the right

523
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:24,869
is using PowerShell to drop or to hide

524
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:28,080
the malware and then drop it and then

525
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,789
what I was just talking about the fact

526
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,859
of using the power sploit in order to

527
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:35,489
inject the payload into Explorer and

528
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:37,859
then tunnel it to the situ so the

529
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:41,580
technique on the left is the one on on

530
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:45,889
your right sorry is the one who's who it

531
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:50,189
was in using that specific attack and

532
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:53,219
just one or two things about the Red

533
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:57,149
Bank so the Red Bank was an attack that

534
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:00,059
was attributed to blue nor off in Chile

535
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:03,570
it contained the dotnet downloader which

536
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:06,599
you can see on the bottom side this is

537
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,279
actually the dotnet downloader and the

538
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:11,340
attack was actually happening over

539
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:14,429
LinkedIn so the lure the the initial

540
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,978
lure was over LinkedIn an employee of

541
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,509
the company of the of the Bank was lured

542
00:26:16,979 --> 00:26:21,929
by the attackers to actually download

543
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:23,879
some client that will allow him to apply

544
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,549
for for a job

545
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:28,289
and this small client was in the

546
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:33,199
background running this dotnet

547
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:35,759
downloader which actually decrypted the

548
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:38,399
PowerShell agent called power tan bar

549
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:43,739
which is in use by Lazarus and still

550
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:46,738
attacking cryptocurrencies as well we're

551
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:49,559
seeing how Lazarus are using new

552
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:52,709
techniques how they are using PowerShell

553
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:58,199
in order to attack cryptocurrency we're

554
00:26:52,709 --> 00:27:01,199
seeing like a map or like a branches of

555
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:02,940
branches of attacks and on my side of

556
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:05,219
you know going back to the debate I

557
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,879
don't see them stopping anywhere soon I

558
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:10,589
just see them evolving all the time so

559
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:12,809
sanctions regulations I don't know what

560
00:27:10,589 --> 00:27:17,729
I don't think Kim Jong who cares about

561
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:20,129
all that and I think that 2020 will show

562
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:23,579
us new techniques will show us new

563
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:28,978
attack vectors and that's my two cents

564
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:32,339
here back to you Danny all right I think

565
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:34,829
that he cares about money because he

566
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:38,069
needs money so let's do a little bit of

567
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:40,349
a little jargon overview who doesn't

568
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:44,309
know ky C's know your customer it's a

569
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:45,839
set of procedures that some regulations

570
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:47,819
especially in financial institutions

571
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,499
they have to follow when they work with

572
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:51,599
customers whether it's private people or

573
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:53,639
companies so you have your customers

574
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,339
acceptance policy you decide which

575
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,799
customers are part of your customer

576
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:02,009
group who will your accept you have

577
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,469
identification using government IDs you

578
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:07,649
have a bunch of companies doing like

579
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:10,469
verification of documents AML so you

580
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:13,589
have the Financial Action Task Force

581
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:15,569
they give advisories on which transfer

582
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:19,099
you can do business with which ones you

583
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:21,209
can't do business with record-keeping

584
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:23,789
reporting transactions the you think are

585
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:28,379
malicious having your risk controls in

586
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:31,408
place and there's a CF t which is count

587
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:33,448
count combating the financing of terror

588
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,519
which relates to North Korea you have

589
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:37,110
weapons of mass destruction they're

590
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,500
trying to develop so you

591
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,820
want to move money there two types of

592
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,290
exchanges that we're going to talk about

593
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,090
it's a there's a small difference

594
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,580
between the procedures they do

595
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,530
so it's either Fiat - crypto which is

596
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,470
like US dollars euros - crypto

597
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,970
currencies or triplet or crypto so and

598
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,420
they do have different regulations on

599
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,030
them also in the regulatory area our

600
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,970
last talk from London yellow link was

601
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,160
mostly on the inter intra exchange like

602
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,950
inside financial crimes happening aimed

603
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,929
exchanges this is going to be everything

604
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,260
that's outside the exchange when you try

605
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:15,630
to get the money out

606
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:18,870
so why regulation matters we have this

607
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:22,350
nice graph from cipher trace which shows

608
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:24,570
you the red part is the amount of

609
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:29,040
criminal activity which is ransomware

610
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:31,110
malware money flowing into exchange the

611
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,270
top ten exchanges with strong AML

612
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:37,409
procedures you can see it's the priests

613
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:40,500
in line most of it is legit but here you

614
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,809
have the top 10 biggest exchanges the

615
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,380
most volume but with the weakest or no

616
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:49,918
AML you can see how a big part of it is

617
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:54,600
a criminal activity dark web

618
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,520
you have miners but you see that the

619
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,290
legit traffic is way smaller so we see

620
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,049
we do see the growth and you see that

621
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,370
when there is no strong AML procedures

622
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,710
especially in countries that don't

623
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:11,489
enforce it you have a lot more criminal

624
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:12,900
activity going there bit some 2018 we're

625
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,549
talking about it was one of the recent

626
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:22,080
hacks it was attributed to North Korea

627
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:25,080
35 million won which is 31 35 billion

628
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,299
won which is 31 and a half million

629
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,320
dollars have been stolen and if you look

630
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:33,870
at a word that money went most of it got

631
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:38,330
mixed went through a bunch of mixers but

632
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:41,280
it went to you big so why why you big

633
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:44,129
it's a exchange in Russia there's no

634
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,168
regulation no mo procedures you can

635
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,280
withdraw money without even having your

636
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,280
ID stand

637
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:55,169
there's a bunch of prop like they have a

638
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:58,779
lot of payment processor Z and X and

639
00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:00,519
payee you can convert crypto to you as

640
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:04,480
the arugula very easily so it's very

641
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:09,909
easy to cash out and like I said no and

642
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,470
no kyc or AML measures either took some

643
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,869
of my time but we'll try to get this

644
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:17,080
quick new rule by the Financial Action

645
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:18,639
Task Force which basically put

646
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,070
everything that you have on financial

647
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,469
institutions put it on crypto exchanges

648
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,809
if you transfer more than 1,000 dollars

649
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,210
worth of money you need the original

650
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:34,570
name wall address his ID national ID and

651
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:38,169
same goes with whoever's receiving it it

652
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,029
they do put the guidelines out and they

653
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,129
said they gave 12 12 months of the

654
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:45,429
countries that are compliant with the

655
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:51,158
eff ATF so the review said will be in

656
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:53,679
June 2020 AMD five basically a similar

657
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:57,659
version extends AML procedures in

658
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:01,269
European countries to crypto also

659
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,940
restricts a lot of things of based

660
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:07,450
mostly kyc and strong AML and the

661
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:11,980
customers made will also it went into

662
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:14,769
force on July 9 but they gave all the

663
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:20,769
European EU member countries until

664
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:25,029
January 2020 to comply with that so I

665
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:28,299
made my point on why all those hacks end

666
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:31,330
up in exchanges with the poor AML and I

667
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:34,360
gave you just the two major regulatory

668
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:38,320
changes now but all the countries are

669
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:42,428
doing that Japan after the hacks made

670
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,850
very strict regulation and legislation

671
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:48,309
and cryptic exchanges with big fines so

672
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,230
that's why I think it's gonna be way

673
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,899
hard to cash out

674
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,669
either made its point on how easy it is

675
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:55,209
to hack exchanges but that's always been

676
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:58,210
like that

677
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:01,509
and always keep being like that so any

678
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,340
questions well first of all thank you so

679
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:09,099
much IDO and Danny

680
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:09,099
