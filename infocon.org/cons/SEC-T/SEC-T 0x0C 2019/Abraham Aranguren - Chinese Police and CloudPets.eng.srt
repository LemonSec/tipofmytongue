1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:13,019
so let's start I'm the director at seven

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,150
acuity and did some stuff before with

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,680
gear 53 and version one if you are

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,140
familiar with you learn security I also

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,000
wrote a course for them practical web

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,700
defence about hacking and defending web

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,440
applications some previous presentations

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,509
and then some certifications if you are

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,240
interested in that then if you find this

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,710
talk interesting we did previously some

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,410
similar work with another application

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:40,710
mandated in South Korea basically in

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,220
South Korea it was mandated by law that

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,780
you would like every child in the

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,460
country should have should be like

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,380
running an app so that the parents would

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,730
be able to control them and we audited

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,500
that and we found a lot of problems so

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,029
if you find this talk interesting you

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,579
might be interested on that as well so

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,899
this is all like available for free you

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,059
can you can just check it on these our

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:06,180
public Tantus reports for mobile apps so

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,789
in this talk I'm going to cover three

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,590
different mobile applications their

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,080
background first we are going to talk

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,620
about cloud pads then and then two

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,310
Chinese police apps right so the Chinese

29
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:24,420
police apps one is called I job and this

30
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,940
one is to use by police to gather

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,350
information about citizens like on the

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,179
spot like asking them questions on

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,220
filling forms and the other one is more

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,740
like they install an app on your phone

35
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,869
and then get data from it right so I'm

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,229
going to talk about this too as well so

37
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,210
let's start with cloud pets instead of

38
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,130
explaining all like boring stuff like

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,439
you have to press this and all this I'm

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,658
just going to show you our video which

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,658
will make this a little bit easier so

42
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:04,949
[Music]

43
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,839
now with cloud pets there are so many

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,630
ways to send blood through the cloud

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,440
welcome to flood control we have a story

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,530
from death

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,410
spotty many Texans receive a story from

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,260
your dad who's far away for a lullaby

49
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,140
from mom every day send a game to play

50
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:26,670

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:30,209
with Grandma easy as that so much love

52
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,940
with progress for $39.99 plus $6.99

53
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,100
processing and handling each cloud pet

54
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,050
connects to the special free app that

55
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,560
will download to almost any smart device

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,680
so you can send stories games lullabies

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,870
or messages you can call or log on at

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:55,110
clouds at Scone this large device is not

59
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:56,910
included separately this is like a

60
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,590
review that explained for family members

styles to choose from and we've got the

66

teddy bear here each one works with a

67
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,390
free app that lets parents grandparents

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,520
kids and other long-distance family

69
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,750

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,670
voice messages when you purchase a cloud

71
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,100
Pet stuffed animal download the free app

72
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,690
and register the animal then invite

73
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,090
family and friends to download the app

74
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,070
on their end to record and send a

75
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,230
message the child presses the toys right

76
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,560
paw and can't wait to see you when you

77
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,660
come to visit through the app determine

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,940
who to send the message to and then send

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,560
it the recipient can then use his or her

80
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,430
act to listen to the message and send

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,200
back a response when your cloud pet has

82
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,730
received a message it's red heart will

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,630
light up and you can squeeze the toys

84
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,549
left paw to hear the message

85
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,230
the cloud pet will only play one message

86
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,390
at a time but all the messages can be

87
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,100
stored in the app only people who you

88
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,410
have invited can send messages to your

89
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,500
child's cloud pet also a parent can

90
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,030
choose to approve

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,580
message before it gets sent to the

92
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,680
child's cloud pet also through the app

93
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,090
typically games is our cloud pad or here

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,940
at the cloud pet reading stories and

95
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,620
sing lullabies additional app updates

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,930
will deliver more interactive content

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,970
the cloud that requires three double A

98
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,470
batteries which are not included now the

99
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,450
app is a free download from the App

100
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,310
Store and Google Play however it is not

101
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,200
compatible with all iOS and Android

102
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,880
smartphones because it uses Bluetooth

103
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,520
Low Energy technology

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,380
we tried testing it first on an lg g3

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,260
Android smartphone and it was not

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,360
compatible well it did work on an iPhone

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,650
6 and a newer iPad we had some trouble

108
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,419
connecting the app to the cloud pet

109
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,700
we're not sure what the problem was but

110
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,130
eventually it did connect and work so

111
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,360
despite all that this is a cute product

112
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,580
that would be great for long-distance

113
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,660
grandkids and grandparents or kids and

114
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,640
family members to ploy it in the

115
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,440
military it's just too cute and cuddly

116
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,310
way to keep in touch and it's for ages 3

117
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:05,260
and up for where to buy and current

118
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,540
prices visit ttpm as okay so that's in

119
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,770
theory how it is supposed to work right

120
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,680
and we saw that so just to summarize

121
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,080
there's a parent and a child and the

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,000
parent is like far from home and the

123
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,099
idea is they can like send a message

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,500
through the toy to the child and then

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,940
the child can like reply and stuff hug

126
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,640
the toy and all these kind of things

127
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,840
right which in theory is nice but in

128
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,409
practice you are going to see what

129
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,299
happened so yeah that's basically the

130
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,950
idea and the other thing that you heard

131
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:41,380
maybe in the video is that it uses

132
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:43,810
Bluetooth Low Energy right so this is

133
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,600
how it works right like this mobile app

134
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,370
on the parent phone and the parent is

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,900
like far from home so he's away from the

136
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,400
toy so these of course is not using

137
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,909
Bluetooth because for Bluetooth you have

138
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,120
to be close so the way this works is is

139
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,590
like sent the mobile app is sending the

140
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,390
messages and receiving the messages

141
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,359
through the puppet servers and then they

142
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,039
are stored in Amazon s3 which for some

143
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,490
infrastructure or guys among you you

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,450
will be already like oh my god and then

145
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,010
the children the children device so they

146
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,270
should also have like some mobile phone

147
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,419
or something

148
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,909
the app is closer to the toy so it

149
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:26,620
communicates with the toy with Bluetooth

150
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:30,610
Low Energy so what what could possibly

151
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,669
go wrong right with this so the first

152
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,680
thing that happened was and when this

153
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:39,789
like got a lot of media attention was

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,970
that they had Mongo database open to the

155
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:45,669
internet without authentication so you

156
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,560
could I get all the messages from all

157
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:48,849
the parent while the from all the

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,259
parents to all the children like

159
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:53,590
everything like the whole damn right

160
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:56,410
they got three ransom request they were

161
00:06:53,590 --> 00:07:00,340
indexed by shodhan almost 1 million

162
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,070
users at risk and then the funny thing

163
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,169
is like the vendor was like always you

164
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,969
know this like vendor thing like oh we

165
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,419
never found any evidence and things like

166
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:15,070
this right yeah so this was funny this

167
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:18,219
is a screenshot from Troy's hands blog

168
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:21,330
post about this about the data is dumped

169
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,310
they were like emails password hashes

170
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,198
the hashes to be honest were in be great

171
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,389
but because there was no password

172
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,560
strength enforcement you could still

173
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,720
like crack some passwords so yeah they

174
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,320
got the phrase ransom and these were

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,539
like some security researcher was like

176
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,789
tweeting about this and this was like

177
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,099
the initial timeline right like first

178
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:47,050
actually before they got hacked there

179
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,550
was a security researcher trying who

180
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,490
found this and was trying to contact

181
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,110
them like through who is records like

182
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,699
every email address he could find a he

183
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:58,900
tried like several ways to contact them

184
00:07:54,699 --> 00:08:01,870
and and they didn't reply and then after

185
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,359
that they got the ransom from the real

186
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,449
bad guys right and then another ransom

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,960
afterwards and then on the 13th of

188
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:14,380
January 2017 they like remove the

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,650
database from from the internet right so

190
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,509
that's the server side of the story now

191
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,789
what happens with the toy right because

192
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,969
the toy uses Bluetooth low-energy so

193
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,250
what could be going on there so there

194
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,320
was this guy called Paul's Paul stones

195
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,990
Paul stone and he

196
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,929
actually reviewed the toy in out of that

197
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,250
and he found like they were like all the

198
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,339
Bluetooth security features were not

199
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,169
used there was no authentication in the

200
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,190
pairing between the device and the on

201
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:47,740
the phone so this is really scary like

202
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,690
anybody can connect to the toy as long

203
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,210
as it's switched on right that's all you

204
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,830
need whether that it's switched on and

205
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:58,870
also he found that you could get

206
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,670
unencrypted firmware upgrades so you

207
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,260
could like as it's trying to upgrade you

208
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,360
could like modify their firmware and hug

209
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:16,210
that the toy itself so let's look at his

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:19,060
demo which I have here he's connecting

211
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,200
to the toy as you can see there's no

212
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,630
manual interaction

213
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,579
he's all through the phone so anybody

214
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,930
from the street could do this right like

215
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:32,089
connect to the toy he's uploading their

216
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,709
audio he's like playing any audio he

217
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:40,810
wants on the toy right so like a

218
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:40,810
stranger just I connect to the toy

219
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,449
then I can make the toy start to record

220
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,840
my voice and then I can fetch the

221
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,840
recording

222
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:03,870
and then play it back then I can make it

223
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:09,370
away don't you approve my boy yeah

224
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,839
so yeah you can use the toy to play any

225
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,910
audio you want without authentication

226
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,279
and you can use the toy as a spy device

227
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,730
that you could like for example the

228
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,260
neighbor apps you know one floor up or

229
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,120
whatever like could connect to the toy

230
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,149
and listen what you're doing at home or

231
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,850
play whatever sound to the child like I

232
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,529
opened the door so like a bad guy gets

233
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,760
in the house or something like try to

234
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:35,200
fool the child right so they were like a

235
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,319
lot of write-ups about the lack of

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,200
security of these a lot of attempts to

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,310
get spiral spiral toys with the company

238
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,850
behind all this to fix it they did not

239
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,859
reply to data breach emails and I mean

240
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:56,440
not very they were not very cooperative

241
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:58,420
right so after all this they were like

242
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,300
all these reports the vendor and and

243
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,060
then mod Scylla asks us like we want you

244
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,640
to check if after all this time like one

245
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,529
year later if the toys are safe now

246
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,300
because the vendor had arguably said

247
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,689
that they all the issues were fixed so

248
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,689
we were asked to check it so because I

249
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,899
mean Viking land and I like like all the

250
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,430
Viking stuff I decided to give some

251
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:23,290
props to Jesper I'm not sure if he's

252
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,930
here who worked with me on this project

253
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:30,399
and that's just prayer that's myself so

254
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,430
just were looked more at the hardware

255
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,560
stuff so he like open the guts of the

256
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,519
thing and he confirmed that the firmware

257
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,109
upgrade was still not fixed

258
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,649
yeah what could possibly go wrong right

259
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,170
so the first thing we found was that as

260
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:50,170
you trying to use the app when you try

261
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,410
to use the help it goes to a clear text

262
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,660
HTTP URL which is called tor to give you

263
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,250
I help and this domain is currently on

264
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,990
sale still on sale this morning I

265
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:03,610
checked it again to record the demo and

266
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:06,730
still on sale so it's a bit funny yeah

267
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,710
and and it's over clear text HTTP so

268
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,300
even if it wasn't you could see

269
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,320
like money in the middle and display

270
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:18,430
anything you want right so that's more

271
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:30,430
or less how it looks yeah let me show

272
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:33,550
you the demo from this morning so yeah

273
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:40,510
and then you click on tutorial and you

274
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:42,069
can see the clear text HTTP you I know

275
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,000
it's not you cannot see it so you can

276
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:48,460
see it's a clear text 60p URL right and

277
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800
and yeah and you can see here like the

278
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,110
domain may be for sale click here for

279
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,270
more information so domain for sale and

280
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,700
clear text HTTP so you get the best of

281
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:59,740
both worlds right so if you got mine in

282
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,820
the middle you can hack it if you don't

283
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,190
have mine in the middle you can still

284
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,440
own the domain and still get them and

285
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:10,270
here you can put like some fake login

286
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:14,100
page or something right so yeah so

287
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,100
that's one of the things we found and

288
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,650
another thing was that using the the

289
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,949
Popol stones work right like the demo I

290
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,260
showed before he he didn't make it

291
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,010
public the listening one but he made

292
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,620
public the one that can play he is

293
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,840
Nikhil a destroy message on the toy so

294
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,120
we use that because it was already there

295
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,980
and it worked perfectly even after

296
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,870
upgrading the toy because when you

297
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,460
started the toy it tries to get updates

298
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,950
and stuff so we let it update and

299
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,620
everything just to confirm if it was

300
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,020
fixed or not and everything still work

301
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,150
so this was all like not fixed like you

302
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,460
can't connect to the toy and use it as a

303
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,480
spy device or push any audio you want

304
00:13:54,460 --> 00:14:00,100
and still what's working

305
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,040
still no firmware protections in place

306
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:06,400
so you can still like push any filmer

307
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,260
you want and it's not verifying it's not

308
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,270
like signing or anything it's just doing

309
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:15,189
us your see checksum and that's it right

310
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:17,939
so it's not a very good check yeah and

311
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:21,460
the other thing is they were still using

312
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,589
Amazon s3 so

313
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,560
all their messages are there and as long

314
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:27,940
as you know the location I'm based on

315
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,770
all you've seen before you can probably

316
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,830
guess a bit more but yeah it's no

317
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:39,970
there's no authentication right so in

318
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:42,220
summary you can store and replay for its

319
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,020
messages with these toys they suppose

320
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,339
the personal information of more almost

321
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:52,660
a million customers yeah potential spy

322
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:55,540
devices Mozilla asked for a retest we

323
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,550
found they didn't fix much then they

324
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,899
coordinated with Amazon and everybody

325
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,640
else they did all the hard work and they

326
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,970
actually removed the toys from the shops

327
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,670
so I think that a good thing that you

328
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,320
know sometimes in the security community

329
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,270
you see how you can get away with

330
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
getting hacked and not caring about

331
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,660
security and nothing happens and then

332
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,969
even the shares go up because you are

333
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,529
more known whatever so in this case you

334
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,970
can see like not taking security

335
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,970
seriously actually resulted in the

336
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,720
company going bust I think they are

337
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:30,600
broke now so yeah so is removed so now

338
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:33,220
let's talk about the Chinese apps so

339
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:38,980
yeah there's the two hours right there's

340
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:42,010
the I job which is the one that police

341
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,350
people will use like for example you're

342
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,000
crossing the border or they see you

343
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,589
doing something suspicious on the street

344
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,089
or something like this then they would

345
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,370
ask you some questions and then they

346
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:54,700
would feel some questionnaire so this is

347
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,339
the I job one and then they'd be x b XA

348
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,020
q1 it's more like they install it on the

349
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,940
phone and then get all your contacts

350
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,140
messages and everything and try to see

351
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,820
your threat level right so the

352
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,339
background of this is that the chinese

353
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,130
government uses these apps to evaluate

354
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,320
the threat level of the minority Muslim

355
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:15,910
population in a region in a region that

356
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,600
I'm not really sure how to pronounce

357
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:22,180
something like shinyang and Human Rights

358
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,820
Watch requested a project funded by the

359
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,649
open technology fund for this to

360
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:32,529
investigate the potential violation of

361
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:35,290
Human Rights so this is the the name of

362
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,649
the thing so integrated integrated joint

363
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,559
of

364
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,240
relations platform so this is a system

365
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,879
that the Chinese put together to collect

366
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,559
data on the Muslim population of King

367
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,740
yang to determine their level of threat

368
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,389
right so this is the idea and because I

369
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,579
know I'm not going to get the politics

370
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:54,639
right I'm going to let the human rights

371
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:56,019
activist to explain this because we just

372
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,449
did the technical stuff and they did

373
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,850
actually all the hard working including

374
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:04,178
risking their own lives to do all this

375
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:11,260
so credit goes to them and I prefer that

376
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:12,850
they explain it because I'm sure I used

377
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,730
to be one of those people like I got

378
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:17,918
nothing to hide I'm just a student but I

379
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,649
was very wrong they're targeting

380
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,250
everyone as long as you've gone out of

381
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:27,158
your house you're being surveilled in

382
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,409
Xinjiang in northwestern China 13

383
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:31,750
million Turkic Muslims are already

384
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:33,210
enduring extraordinary suppression at

385
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,350
the hands of the Chinese government

386
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,390
authorities there are building a

387
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,260
surveillance state to be able to track

388
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,260
their every move

389
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,970
across the northwestern province of

390
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,880
Xinjiang an estimated 1 million Chinese

391
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,070
Muslims had vanished into a vast network

392
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,010
of detention centers for what China

393
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,480
calls re-education the region is now

394
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,200
under what's probably the most intense

395
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,550
government surveillance in the world

396
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,800
every 200 metres would have a police

397
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,510
checkpoint and then on top of that there

398
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,960
are all these checkpoints at public

399
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,150
places wherever you go if you're Weger

400
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,820
they stop you they would just say

401
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,800
where's your ID I want to check your ID

402
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,560
they'll punch in the ID number and then

403
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,240
they would see everything about you one

404
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,909
tool at the heart of Xinjiang

405
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,910
surveillance system is the IJ o P or the

406
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:27,670
integrated joint operations platform the

407
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,800
I GOP has an app that's used by police

408
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,780
and government officials to track

409
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,149
extraordinary amounts of personal

410
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,770
information about individuals ranging

411
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,560
from their religious habits to their

412
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,629
blood type human rights watch got a hold

413
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,940
of a copy of the app and used a

414
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,950
technique called reverse engineering to

415
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,080
look at the source code basically the

416
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,630
design of the app this is what it looks

417
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,580
like woman off ok so I'm just going to

418
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,470
stop it here because then I don't have

419
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:57,340
to stop it later to explain something

420
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,630
else so basically they gave us the app

421
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,370
and we did all the reverse engineering

422
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,960
all the technical stuff they they were

423
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,479
the human right activist so they were

424
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,090
not like super technical and one of the

425
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,230
things that I will explain a bit more

426
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:13,209
later that I did on this test was they

427
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,180
they have a phone but it was like not

428
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,960
routed to test this and because this is

429
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:22,420
an app that police officers used to log

430
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,180
into some police server and upload all

431
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,340
the information the app was only showing

432
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,460
a login screen right we didn't know like

433
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,500
what's after and even when we like

434
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,450
reviewed the code and everything it's

435
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,940
all in Chinese and Google Translate is

436
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,490
not perfect so we had we needed to give

437
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,260
the human right activists a way to

438
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:47,350
review the screens without being logged

439
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:51,310
in right so to do this I modified that

440
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,699
so all the activities of the mobile

441
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,190
application would be

442
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,260
exported because normally if you are

443
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,700
route or if the phone is rooted or you

444
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,590
are running a DPS route you can invoke

445
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,170
any activity even if it is not exported

446
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,909
on Android but if the phone is not

447
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,520
rooted ADB doesn't run as root and you

448
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:10,520
won't be able to invoke any activity

449
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,270
that is not exported so long story short

450
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,400
I modified the app so the human right

451
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,500
activist would be able to see all these

452
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,630
screens and then they will make the

453
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,880
decision okay this is really bad or it's

454
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,470
really not right because I mean that

455
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,120
judgment it was more for them than for

456
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,000
us because it was like non technical we

457
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:32,360
just did the technical stuff right so

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,210
this was like coordinated work with them

459
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,969
and yeah that's one of the things and

460
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,100
the other thing I did on this test as

461
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,600
well was to translate the app because of

462
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,000
course it was in Chinese so we don't

463
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,850
understand much or what to tell you or

464
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,760
anything so we translated the app but

465
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,500
all these demos that you see now this is

466
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,180
from the work that we did so that they

467
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,920
could invoke the activities and another

468
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,550
thing that I wanted to say is that I

469
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:02,930
gave them like a bunch of adb commands

470
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:05,120
so with adb in android you can like send

471
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:07,520
commands to invoke any activity so I

472
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,500
gave them commands for to invoke all the

473
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,200
activities like ice cryptid this and

474
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,150
then they would be able like to using a

475
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,500
script to to call all the activities and

476
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,380
more efficiently because they were like

477
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,180
a lot of like every authenticated screen

478
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,190
had a had an activity right so there

479
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,560
were there were too many so with this

480
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,450
day they were able to more efficiently

481
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,919
review the screens so when you're

482
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,690
looking at these screens just remember

483
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,400
that we did the part that maybe is

484
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,020
possible like they would be able to see

485
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,820
the screens and made a decision if it

486
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,760
was really bad or not Sur pulls up an

487
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,909
individual's profile they enter the

488
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,379
person's name ID number ethnicity and

489
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,120
then the officer takes a photo of the

490
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:48,950
person's ID card to see if that matches

491
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,449
the person's face as you scroll you see

492
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,970
more information is being collected from

493
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,850
the person including their address how

494
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,970
tall they are their blood type their

495
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:01,459
educational level their occupation their

496
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,330
political affiliation information about

497
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:08,059
their car license plate driver's name

498
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,610
driver's ID card number on its surface

499
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:13,580
most of this information looks like

500
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,549
standard fare for police but as we dig

501
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:20,239
deeper into the app we can see that

502
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:23,720
ordinary routine legal behavior is being

503
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:25,340
treated by authorities as suspect this

504
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,529
is what it looks like when the I GOP

505
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,499
system has flagged someone whose phone

506
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,330
number the system has lost track of the

507
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:33,710
I GOP system sends an alert to

508
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,749
government officials to go and

509
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,850
investigate the reason why that phone

510
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,379
number has gone missing and know if this

511
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,658
person is suspicious and requires

512
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:45,049
further investigation or here's another

513
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:46,609
example this is a report that the ID GOP

514
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,739
system sends to government officials

515
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:52,070
about someone who used an unusual amount

516
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:53,659
of electricity the report includes the

517
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,340
date in which the unusual amount of

518
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,950
electricity used was logged by the

519
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,529
system how much electricity was used

520
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,409
what was the meter reading and what is

521
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:05,029
the usual range of electricity used then

522
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:08,119
the government official is required to

523
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:09,739
go and investigate this person if you

524
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:12,259
use whatsapp or viber

525
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:14,840
or telegram that might be considered

526
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,759
suspicious if you go at the back door of

527
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,220
your house instead of the front the

528
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,440
police might turn up to investigate the

529
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,960
list goes on the information from the

530
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,700
app feeds into a central system and

531
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,549
combines with information from other

532
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,529
surveillance systems including CCTV

533
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:34,820
cameras that rely on facial recognition

534
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:36,019
software and even Wi-Fi sniffers that

535
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,480
are used as people walk through

536
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:42,320
checkpoints to pull information off

537
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,080
their phones the I GOP system aggregates

538
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,960
all this data about people flags those

539
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,749
it deems suspicious and sends alerts to

540
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,570
nearby officials these dubious criteria

541
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:56,179
are being used to identify large numbers

542
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,030
of people many of whom are then far

543
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:01,530
materially locked up

544
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,750
in total I spent about a month in

545
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,399
different jails I wasn't officially

546
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,440
accused of anything or charged with

547
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,720
anything the official paperwork said

548
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,790
something like I was arrested under the

549
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,340
suspicion of disrupting the societal

550
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,470
order and after that I was basically

551
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,959
under house arrest because they marked

552
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,630
my ID card it's time for the Chinese

553
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
government to stop persecuting perfectly

554
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,560
legal behavior it's time for the Chinese

555
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,140
government to end its repression of

556
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,790
turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and it's time

557
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:38,310
for it to dismantle this surveillance

558
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:40,889
state that's the human rights activists

559
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:45,149
explanation so that's the politics out

560
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:47,160
of the way so yeah these it was

561
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,350
developed by this Chinese electronic

562
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,930
technology group corporation a

563
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:55,949
state-owned military contractor set up

564
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:58,020
in 2017 and yeah they're mostly focused

565
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,630
on artificial intelligence big data so

566
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,400
it seems to make sense that they might

567
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,900
be like a good choice for this kind of

568
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,220
data gathering stuff and yeah it was

569
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,400
supposedly compromising the human rights

570
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:14,370
of the minority Chinese population so we

571
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,710
had to figure this out so the first

572
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:19,530
problem and we had this with Mercer if

573
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:21,300
as well as Marshall was in Korea so it

574
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,030
was all in Korean and we had to

575
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,090
translate it so this was the same thing

576
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:29,610
with apk tools as decompile then look

577
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,959
for strings.xml we will translate it and

578
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,240
then with apktool

579
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,420
again you just build a apk back in sign

580
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,690
and install love apktool

581
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,250
and yeah you it's really not like a

582
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,400
proper translation it's like broken

583
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:47,010
English but for for us non non kind of

584
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,200
Chinese it's this RINO Chinese Cantonese

585
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,879
or Mandarin right but for those of us

586
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,730
that don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin

587
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,240
or any of those like Chinese languages

588
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,980
they broken English up version is like

589
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,960
way better than all these like symbols

590
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,480
right like at least you know like more

591
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,560
or less what it might be about now

592
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,110
another thing was just in case you know

593
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,580
just a tap tour so if you're like

594
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,719
checking an app that you don't really

595
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,389
know

596
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,549
just when you mine in the middle just

597
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:20,070
said the tourists are not bound proxy to

598
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:23,429
burp and you can still like inspect the

599
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,780
traffic but you know if anything if they

600
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,150
go after you or whatever

601
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,570
you have some peace of mind that you

602
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,820
know they won't hopefully you know your

603
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,820
your IP right so that's another thing

604
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,379
that we did and then the issue that I

605
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,908
was explaining before during the demo

606
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,100
right like what's after the login

607
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:42,900
because we were given this app that was

608
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,059
leaked from from the police but they

609
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,460
didn't know I mean we can't login

610
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:50,129
because we don't have login to login to

611
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,740
the police systems in China right and

612
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,870
and that would be like crossing a line

613
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,169
as well even if we like have some time

614
00:26:54,870 --> 00:27:01,949
or something so we need like a way to

615
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:04,380
show to show what's after the login

616
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,720
right so that's what we did just again

617
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,200
with apktool but in this case changing

618
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,730
the Android manifest export all the app

619
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,090
activities just changing the manifest

620
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:18,539
exported to true and then just build it

621
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:21,720
again and also like with I automate this

622
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:24,020
a bit with a script to give them the adb

623
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,950
commands so that they can invoke the

624
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,480
activities because they were not very

625
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,179
technical and then with this they were

626
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,120
able to look at the screens right

627
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,190
because we will look at the screen but

628
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,199
we don't have like the human right

629
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,809
activist background to decide if that

630
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,460
spring is bad or not right and they they

631
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,990
did so that's why we need that now in

632
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,039
this report this is not really a

633
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:51,900
painters report this our kind of

634
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,500
analysis report right because we're like

635
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,240
trying to find evidence of activities

636
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,159
right like the goal of the test in this

637
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,980
case was not to find security

638
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:05,190
vulnerabilities it was to find what are

639
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,070
they doing with this application so this

640
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:12,049
is why the severity is not like high low

641
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:15,299
medium critical is like proven unclear

642
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:19,440
you know this kind of language right so

643
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:23,190
in this case blood type and political

644
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,000
views this was proven this was clear I

645
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:31,640
this our field for it on the form so we

646
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,760
it's carry snow not speculation and and

647
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,370
yeah like they assumed the assumed goal

648
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,490
of the app was math-amazing a massive

649
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,800
data collection to mine and gather data

650
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,540
about individuals and we were like

651
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,690
trying to find like what kind of

652
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,250
indicators are there in the app right so

653
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,780
we were looking for the technical

654
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:56,690
evidence of these potential issues right

655
00:28:52,780 --> 00:29:01,250
so so yeah we found some evidence of

656
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,950
this and then you have here like even

657
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,350
like hide the blood type or like all

658
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:10,910
these ones they're like in the app right

659
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:12,800
interestingly it's in English so yeah so

660
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:16,790
this is of course all the compiled code

661
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,290
this this the this is the app as you can

662
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,980
see like the translation is not perfect

663
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:25,659
but at least like height blood type and

664
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:29,090
all other things were translated fine

665
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,520
and then the electricity consumption I

666
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,159
found interesting right because maybe

667
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,620
they're thinking is like if electricity

668
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,570
consumption goes up like a lot in a

669
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,429
house then maybe that guy is like doing

670
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,720
something weird right I like building a

671
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,970
bomb or something maybe that's the logic

672
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,380
I don't know probably should be

673
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,290
something along those lines right like

674
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,870
if if somebody's electricity consumption

675
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,190
triples all of a sudden like what is

676
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:57,949
that person doing right maybe that's

677
00:29:52,190 --> 00:30:03,170
where the reasoning for this so so yeah

678
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:05,960
I think their thinking is probably like

679
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:08,570
with all these like radical Islamic

680
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,840
terrorism maybe they're trying to like

681
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,730
spot if somebody's like doing something

682
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,620
funny right

683
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,780
so they were checking like if there's

684
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:23,659
something abnormal about the electricity

685
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:25,220
use and they were also I mean this is

686
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,850
all like a little bit of an invasion of

687
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,450
privacy of course but I think that's

688
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:34,159
they're thinking it's my guess right

689
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:38,840
yeah and then it's like employing a

690
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,740
database that aggregates a variety of

691
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,928
data about the

692
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,309
dividuals and well the Chinese are known

693
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:44,929
to do all these like facial recognition

694
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:50,570
they have like cameras all over the

695
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:52,010
country as well and yeah so so there's

696
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:55,040
some assumptions in this it's not like

697
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,470
all super clear but more or less we

698
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,750
found that a police officer can file a

699
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,540
report to investigate the occurrence of

700
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:05,179
unusual power consumption and they can

701
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,450
do so for any given date and mark any

702
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:11,530
reasons for for the same right so these

703
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:15,920
types the ground to additional

704
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:18,370
investigation by the other agency and on

705
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,940
the end then there's like some

706
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:24,939
mitigation in case of false positives

707
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:30,650
and a justification by law enforcement

708
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:33,559
right so so yeah that's the electricity

709
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,960
stuff and then here you can see like all

710
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,059
the all the fields for this that we

711
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,800
found in the in the app so it's pretty

712
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:46,700
evident that they are checking this

713
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,830
another thing that we found was the

714
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,220
tools that they use and process right an

715
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,800
option under electronic appears to refer

716
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,020
to problematic tools and tools that may

717
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,889
be implemented to make explosives so

718
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:04,790
they seem to be tracking this as well

719
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:06,770
and they identified that officers were

720
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,059
capable of saving and submit a report to

721
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,550
the headquarters

722
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:13,460
I would explosive materials and tools

723
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,260
right so an officer can ask for

724
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,410
investigation of the matter and then

725
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:20,540
this investigation could be handled over

726
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:24,410
and carried on by the Public Security

727
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:29,480
Agency so this is the this is the

728
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:32,929
activity itself and it's it's pretty

729
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:37,250
like clear as well like this there's

730
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:39,380
some clear evidence about this and and

731
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,350
yeah there's like different so the app

732
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,320
is just one of the parts of the system

733
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,270
right we looked at the app itself on

734
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,428
this there's also a CCTV cameras with

735
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,330
facial recognition this Wi-Fi sniffers

736
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,700
that

737
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,449
the human activist was talking about in

738
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:01,080
the video the Wi-Fi sniffers will

739
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,880
probably be tracking the MAC address of

740
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,370
the phone to correlate it with all the

741
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,650
data and then they correlate all this

742
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:11,370
with lie simply license plates citizen

743
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:13,620
ID card numbers then there's also like

744
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:18,300
car ownership health insurance like all

745
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:22,080
these things we found as well so so yeah

746
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:27,629
this there are a few checks then there's

747
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,280
no effective privacy like this it's not

748
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,160
like Europe right like with all these

749
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,050
like data protection laws that we have

750
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,920
here I think so it'll be a little bit

751
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:39,600
different over there and yeah there's

752
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,950
not really a lot of information about

753
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,510
what they are doing and there's no

754
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,210
formal system to find out what

755
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:49,410
information is held about them but that

756
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:51,690
is more or less the status of this so

757
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:58,320
these are the they sniff the Wi-Fi

758
00:33:51,690 --> 00:34:02,490
sniffers that we saw before and yeah and

759
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,250
then it's like unclear how these things

760
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,590
are related and how like the databases

761
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,730
and everything else is is connected

762
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,159
right now because we just looked at the

763
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,580
app but the like big data picture of all

764
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,290
this is like difficult like we are not

765
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,299
inside of the Chinese government systems

766
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,800
to know how they correlate all this

767
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,060
right like we can only make guesses

768
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,760
based on the based on the app and yeah

769
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,830
this the human right activists argue

770
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,960
that these are intruding on the privacy

771
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:35,610
of citizens and yeah putting at risk

772
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,980
people have been presumed innocent on

773
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:42,810
all this right so in summary we found

774
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,810
the concerns expressed by Human Rights

775
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:51,270
Watch were valid and the analysis was

776
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:54,299
funded by the open Technology Fund yeah

777
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:56,219
and we actually did a lot of close

778
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,200
collaboration with with the Human Rights

779
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,939
Watch team because of course this

780
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
required them to tell like if something

781
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,640
is bad or not which we didn't know we

782
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,910
just did the technical part

783
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,089
yeah potential violation of Human Rights

784
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,379
other things from the conclusion is like

785
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:14,240
evident and undeniable that the app is

786
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,579
capable of connect collecting and

787
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,578
managing vast amounts of specific data

788
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:25,939
yeah and according to the European

789
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:29,150
Convention of Human Rights this this

790
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,339
would be like a human right violation

791
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,519
right according like to this kind of

792
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:36,500
classification of things and yeah that's

793
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,390
what I said before about the different

794
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:44,019
severities is not high medium low is

795
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:47,180
like proven and proven on all this so

796
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:50,569
yeah this is a picture of that and then

797
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,390
let me talk quickly about the other app

798
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:55,339
so this I'm in the act the app I talked

799
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,348
about before is like data collection

800
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:58,430
like pull you stop you and fill a form

801
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,039
and things like this

802
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,660
and this is more kind of invasive right

803
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,730
because in this case they're actually

804
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,259
installing an app on your phone so they

805
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,759
are like stopping you on the street and

806
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:11,299
installing an app on your phone and then

807
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:13,910
this app gets like all your contacts all

808
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:18,910
your messages and all this so I think

809
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:22,129
this is our more clear a kind of privacy

810
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:26,480
concern I've done than the previous one

811
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,430
right so yeah we reverse the app so you

812
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,220
could argue is white box methodology

813
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,730
because we had even though it was

814
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:37,669
decompiled we had the source code and

815
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:39,950
yeah we reviewed that and it was similar

816
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:44,119
right like they gave us an app and then

817
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:45,828
we had to check like what was it

818
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:48,259
checking and in this case it was

819
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:49,400
checking for example which apps are

820
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:53,859
installed on the phone

821
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:57,289
it was checking all the things right and

822
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:59,359
let me see so yeah what did they seek

823
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:01,759
right so they were looking for extremist

824
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,269
Islamic content any kind of material on

825
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:11,690
slam academic books on Islam copies of

826
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:16,459
the Quran Japanese metal music and

827
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:17,270
radical propaganda so so yeah this was

828
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,470
also by the

829
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:23,960
in technology fun and yeah we did a

830
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:26,299
source code hold it and yeah the app is

831
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,580
in of course available to go from Google

832
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,740
Play or anything like this this like the

833
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,900
previous one it was like a leaked app in

834
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,029
some way by the human rights activists

835
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,560
they gave us the app and then we took it

836
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:45,020
from there

837
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:46,610
so you see minutes so yeah the research

838
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,640
was carried out as delicately as

839
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:51,440
possible meaning that we were trying to

840
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,900
be a little bit stealthy like that we

841
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,330
would not like hammer their servers or

842
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,510
scan anything but try to do like

843
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,830
everything locally and without like

844
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,720
raising suspicion

845
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,370
by authorities or anything like this

846
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,620
right like like focusing on the app

847
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:09,170
itself

848
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:13,910
yeah so some of the issues found a

849
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:16,910
collection of I'm a MC Wi-Fi mark

850
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:19,149
Bluetooth Mac other information about

851
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,980
Android text messages sent and received

852
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:25,820
list of contacts calendar entries

853
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:28,790
country codes and call history so pretty

854
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,910
much everything that can tell a lot

855
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,800
about yourself right and then of the

856
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,740
things

857
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,970
yeah like hardware usage all app usage

858
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,520
details and the md5 hash of the app

859
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:52,160
current contact details and then looking

860
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:53,720
for through the SD card we also found we

861
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,759
also found this get view account

862
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,430
application that would help access the

863
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,760
phone numbers and email addresses right

864
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,890
so yeah so all personal information was

865
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,500
at risk and then this is like they get

866
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:11,810
via counting so then this was really

867
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,720
funny like because like a government

868
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,100
level application that is like sending

869
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,899
it's like gathering all the data and

870
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,060
then it sending it in clear text HTTP to

871
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,370
server in their network even though it's

872
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:24,430
a server in a local address but come on

873
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,910
like HTTP

874
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:31,989
it was a little with yeah funny so yeah

875
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,160
zip file sent overtly the HTTP so that's

876
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:34,539
what the app is doing right now he's

877
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,249
gathering all the information then it

878
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:40,359
creates a zip file and then it sends it

879
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:46,058
to this server in the in the in the

880
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:47,950
police network right by some so the way

881
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,869
this from what we looked at the app the

882
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,839
way this works is they install the app

883
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:55,479
on the on the phone the app is connected

884
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,828
to a Wi-Fi server that they control and

885
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,538
then they are collects all the

886
00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:00,789
information sends it to the wire to the

887
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,410
server in their Wi-Fi network it's

888
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:06,400
probably something they have on the car

889
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:09,009
or something and then they they have the

890
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,039
data right so from what we saw in the

891
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:15,749
app that's what they were doing so yeah

892
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,749
there's an indication of a Wi-Fi server

893
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:20,799
the app doesn't contain a feature that

894
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:23,950
supports an open hotspot so this should

895
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:25,509
be in your opinion some server on the on

896
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,549
the Wi-Fi network that the police

897
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:34,989
connect to and then are able to gather

898
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:37,719
this yeah so that's pretty much it then

899
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:40,089
they like to store stuff on the SD cards

900
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:42,279
I don't know why the SD card if you are

901
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:45,069
not very familiar it's an insecure

902
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:47,079
location to store sensitive stuff

903
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:50,019
because like all the apps can read from

904
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:51,489
there and you can like even without

905
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:53,379
knowing how to unlock the phone you can

906
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:57,279
extract the SD card in some phones and

907
00:40:53,380 --> 00:41:02,009
read everything in there so so yeah they

908
00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:04,869
they do this they we also found like

909
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:07,390
they had something that keeps the SSL

910
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:10,029
validation it's funny that when we did

911
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,430
the South Korea one it was also a

912
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:14,859
similar issue like there was a host

913
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:16,899
allow all hostname verifier so on top of

914
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:18,999
using clear text HTTP they also have

915
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:24,309
code to ignore like SSL warnings and

916
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:26,468
stuff yeah and then we found in this

917
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:29,680
case much more clearly than the previous

918
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:33,999
one that the concerns by the human right

919
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:37,529
activists were valid there are potential

920
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:39,149
violations of human rights yeah

921
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:41,130
evident and undeniable that the

922
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:43,099
application is capable of collecting and

923
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,509
managing vast amounts of specific data

924
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:47,729
it is certain that the gather material

925
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:50,489
can become a basis for further action

926
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:53,308
and according to the European Convention

927
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:55,249
of Human Rights which is the standard

928
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:57,660
against which these things are measured

929
00:41:55,249 --> 00:42:01,618
the above practice can be considered a

930
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:04,229
human rights violation so yeah the

931
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,269
plethora of information gathering

932
00:42:04,229 --> 00:42:08,249
executed by the ABA's we saw at the

933
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:11,819
beginning like all these contacts

934
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:14,368
messages lie everything and the

935
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:17,220
transmission of all this data to a local

936
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:20,869
police file server and we already saw

937
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:24,899
the demo before so in conclusion we

938
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:28,680
looked at three apps cloud plates I job

939
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:32,099
and BX aq the last two being potential

940
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,019
violation of human rights and Human

941
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:38,999
Rights Watch raise concern about the

942
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:41,339
Chinese ones and yeah and of course all

943
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:44,279
the analysis here was like technically

944
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,779
driven we are not like human right

945
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:47,460
activists or anything so we are not

946
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:49,920
getting into the politics we just like

947
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,289
helping the human right activists to

948
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,900
with what they needed but I'm not like

949
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,950
really sure about the political

950
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,930
background all this and this is why I

951
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:02,160
play the video letting the human right

952
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:04,979
activist speak because I am not yeah I'm

953
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,839
not sure about this if if you are into

954
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:08,160
hacking mobile apps we have a training

955
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,690
next week in Amsterdam

956
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,450
and in India if you are watching this

957
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,769
online and another one in Texas and if

958
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,189
you cannot make it there will be some

959
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:19,890
training portal you can if you want to

960
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,940
connect or ask me anything

961
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:26,700
go ahead that's it so more or less 45

962
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,950
minutes as I was told I should use so

963
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,430
any questions thank you first of all big

964
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,430
round of applause

965
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,660
yeah not to be overly political right

966
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:48,040
how well would you say that the I job

967
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:50,500
app was written how well yeah University

968
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,480
you looked at the cold it's like oh my

969
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:55,569
god it looked a little bit shitty right

970
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,400
like like you see like all these like

971
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,440
clear text HTTP like you would think

972
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,720
like government's would do things much

973
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,010
better and this right darlin status

974
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,129
being an i assumption right at least

975
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:09,040
like you you expect like government

976
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:10,480
close to unlimited resources access to

977
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,390
best the best developers in the world

978
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,250
like in theory right like it's like much

979
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,670
stronger than any company in theory

980
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:20,290
right like a government so without

981
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,720
thinking I would expect like much better

982
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,000
than than this but we saw this pattern

983
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,310
as well one day South Korea won right

984
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,869
like they mandated a nap in the whole

985
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,420
country and it was as well using clear

986
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:32,890
text HDPE first and we reported this and

987
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:36,369
in the second test they were using as a

988
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:39,129
cell but ignoring SSL warning so almost

989
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:41,589
the same thing so I don't know maybe

990
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,180
part of the thing is the reason is it's

991
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:45,130
an internal server so they don't really

992
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,540
see it as a threat like if something in

993
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,770
the internal network of police and if

994
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,680
somebody is doing man in the middle

995
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,810
there they have bigger problems maybe

996
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,310
that's their reasoning but you found you

997
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,779
found one ur abilities in the second app

998
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:59,920
be or was it be X cube yeah but you

999
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,630
didn't you didn't find the

1000
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,109
vulnerabilities in the first AI job

1001
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,640
phone mmm we're not looking for

1002
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:10,078
vulnerabilities we were looking for

1003
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,089
evidence of what the human rights

1004
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,680
activists were looking for so that was

1005
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:17,560
like because the app was huge like it

1006
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,419
was I don't know like only for the

1007
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,220
activities like the I don't know I don't

1008
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:25,079
remember right but just to say a number

1009
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,129
it was more than 100 screens his new job

1010
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,560
and the goal was not to find

1011
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,200
vulnerabilities it was to find evidence

1012
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:35,440
of what is this up doing what data are

1013
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,540
they collecting and basically the human

1014
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,380
right activist sent us a question a list

1015
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,579
of questions like we want you to we want

1016
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,960
you to answer these questions like what

1017
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:45,490
data they collecting what

1018
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,830
doing with this data where are they

1019
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,209
sending it to and we had to look at the

1020
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:52,180
app and answer those questions it was

1021
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:54,099
not like a normal pen test and this is

1022
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:58,740
why I'm saying like it was all like

1023
00:45:54,099 --> 00:46:02,320
proven or unclear yeah and this another

1024
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:05,169
hot coming as well can't talk about it

1025
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,270
yet but I'm not I'm not insinuating

1026
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,410
anything but I'm thinking that finding

1027
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,300
vulnerable listen this could be

1028
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:14,109
interesting yeah yeah so where can we

1029
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,609
download it if somebody comes to the

1030
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:19,779
training they will I will share it with

1031
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:21,819
them but it's not it's not public maybe

1032
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,619
it's online I don't know because it made

1033
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,230
me think about this responsible

1034
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:30,119
disclosure yeah irresponsible disclosure

1035
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,119
isn't it irresponsible to not disclose

1036
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,260
that's hypothetical question I think

1037
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,540
maybe maybe some people would be

1038
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,089
thinking all right I didn't look so I

1039
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,279
wouldn't say I mean I'm not a I'm not a

1040
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:44,349
backpack kind of person but you know you

1041
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,270
can make a buck down it maybe somebody

1042
00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:51,160
could yeah maybe but yeah we didn't it

1043
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,950
was not the goal of the audits oh no no

1044
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,170
no I get it I'm just sure those

1045
00:46:52,950 --> 00:47:00,250
activists that would like to yeah

1046
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:02,920
a crack at it probably yeah why not also

1047
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,200
about the the go back to the oh and

1048
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,930
there I hope one I forgot to say like

1049
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,419
this some concerns that they are using

1050
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,640
this up as well to with tourists that

1051
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,960
cross the border like both apps the I

1052
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,160
hope one and the Hyundai ba b XA q1 like

1053
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,140
if you are curious and you get into

1054
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,549
China they might like install the app on

1055
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,049
your phone and and all this kind of

1056
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,210
stuff on your phone even if you're just

1057
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,800
a tourist you're not Muslim or you're

1058
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,720
not Chinese or you don't live there to

1059
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,040
just visiting they are going or listen

1060
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,740
to the Japanese now yeah always be weary

1061
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,779
of those this is going back to the cloud

1062
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,868
first thing it's it is it impossible to

1063
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,520
find them now I don't know I we were

1064
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,290
just given the app so I didn't I never

1065
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,910
have to because they're there commercial

1066
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,650
didn't make me want to buy it but your

1067
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,470
commercial for them made me want to buy

1068
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,690
one which is a shame that we don't have

1069
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,859
we don't have more of them or we don't

1070
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:57,700
have any of them in our gadget shop

1071
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:04,450
those are selling points those are

1072
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:05,589
features yeah all right with a lot of

1073
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,629
people in the audience I'm sure there's

1074
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:10,480
more questions from the audience

1075
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,790
so we have mic runners and this question

1076
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,960
here hi

1077
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,290
okay great talk by the way thank you

1078
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,700
very much thank you what was the Android

1079
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,710
emulator you used to do the reverse

1080
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,799
thing or to do that the live demo like

1081
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:26,350
when you push it through the I like to

1082
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,450
use genymotion okay it's just a personal

1083
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:31,120
preference like some people prefer to

1084
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,379
use the official one but I always used

1085
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,040
any motions all the time

1086
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:40,690
thank you very much and I used a paid

1087
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:44,020
version if you are interested more hands

1088
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,660
in the air just because of the ability

1089
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,490
to have a brits adapter sometimes is

1090
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,299
handy like you have it on same network

1091
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:54,700
as a host and you can like FTP like or

1092
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:58,180
you know read files over SSH more

1093
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:00,270
conveniently it's personal preference so

1094
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,980
you can do it in many ways

1095
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:07,240
any more questions is it harder to ask

1096
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,570
questions when there are more people in

1097
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:15,970
the room are you waiting till after the

1098
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:17,400
talk to ask him personally questions all

1099
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,529
right do we have questions from online

1100
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,150
no we don't but this is a friendly

1101
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,980
reminder that if you don't want to raise

1102
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,840
your hand in front of room of 800 people

1103
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:30,030
you can submit them on Twitter

1104
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:35,080
oh come on over here hi Cristiano via

1105
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:39,220
aren't those apps are all faceted office

1106
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:42,220
like you know you used apk tools yeah to

1107
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,830
decrypt it aren't dot office credit code

1108
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,830
is a plain text I have the code I have

1109
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:52,830
seen his plain text right yeah yeah it

1110
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:55,660
was not very strongly obfuscated we

1111
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:57,520
apktool only gives you the smelly code

1112
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,170
and to look more at Java you would be

1113
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,680
using other like more advanced the

1114
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:06,280
compiler that give you the Java like pry

1115
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,810
con or this normally when there's some

1116
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,620
strong a few station

1117
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:13,810
I find that J DX tends to work better

1118
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:15,700
I'm not sure why but it gives you more

1119
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,160
Java files than the others most of the

1120
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,470
time so another thing you can do is like

1121
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,799
ran several decompilers like some tools

1122
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:26,560
do this as well and then try to see you

1123
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,060
know try to get the Java files that

1124
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,770
won't even get from the other and

1125
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,630
without try to complete the picture it

1126
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,250
depends because different compilers

1127
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:38,380
break break in different ways because

1128
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:42,340
they're using like all these anti anti

1129
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:45,220
reversing tools and stuff to break the

1130
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,890
decompilers so sometimes you have to try

1131
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,620
several but most of the time JDX I find

1132
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:53,470
tends to work pretty well and regarding

1133
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,819
that electricity tracking Chinese

1134
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,980
government used that electricity

1135
00:50:54,820 --> 00:51:00,310
tracking to track down who is using

1136
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:04,120
crypto miners rig so like you know if

1137
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,770
you are from some clan who may abuse the

1138
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:10,839
system so you are looking for money and

1139
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:15,009
crypto miner is you know you are mining

1140
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:18,430
Bitcoin and also they try to track the

1141
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:20,860
crypto miners who is mining bitcoin and

1142
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:24,129
litecoin and all right so they look for

1143
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,270
electricity uses for that reason so

1144
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:32,110
they're not looking for basement

1145
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:36,009
greenhouses thank you all right more

1146
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:39,640
questions are you gonna be interviewed

1147
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:41,110
by security podcasts after this so let I

1148
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:44,020
mean if anybody wants to ask me

1149
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:46,960
