00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,890
on Friday so right yeah there was a

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,719
short notice

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,510
a rearrangement where I had to give it

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:49,969
one day earlier so I had to push

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:52,789
accordingly yeah yeah that's what coffee

20
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,859
is for right that's true so the talk was

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,269
bad

22
00:00:53,859 --> 00:01:01,209
hacking cloud pets but also about

23
00:00:56,269 --> 00:01:06,969
Chinese surveillance yeah so too quick

24
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:10,610
yeah but them were funded by different

25
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:12,949
open funds yeah two of them were funded

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,920
by open Technology Fund yeah

27
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:20,659
and one of them was funded by Mozilla

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,770
yeah and both and Human Rights what's a

29
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:28,159
Human Rights Watch was behind the

30
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,509
tiniest ones yeah yeah and so so all

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,380
three of them were sort of the community

32
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,159
funding the efforts to make the world a

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,039
better place

34
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,700
yes you could say that yeah yep so do

35
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:46,310
you find that that's common thing for

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:50,049
for the kind of assignments that you get

37
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:53,869
or is that becoming more and more common

38
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:56,990
I'm not sure but we have gotten a lot of

39
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,549
work like this over the years like a lot

40
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,039
of open source projects that apply to

41
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:04,249
the open technology fund to get a pen

42
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,549
test we got a lot of tests like this so

43
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,740
it's been something we've done a lot of

44
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,810
another kind of similar app that we

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,700
looked at back in the day was smart

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,290
sheriff in South Korea hmm which was

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,200
like this app that

48
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,849
south korean government by law order

49
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,060
that every child in the country has to

50
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,709
have installed well so that their

51
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,379
parents can do better parenting like

52
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:31,090
control like at what hours the child can

53
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,980
use the phone to control for real yeah

54
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,390
that's interesting because i'm not an

55
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,709
expert at south korea matter i don't

56
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:42,768
think of them lying like with china you

57
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:47,480
expect them to not be so friendly to

58
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:50,390
human rights but what's the any back

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,859
grant why south korea wanted that i i'm

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,129
not really sure i mean it's a very

61
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,890
different culture so I just Spanish I'm

62
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:01,120
not Korean so I wouldn't be able to to

63
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:03,649
talk much about the culture and stuff

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,299
but it seems to be something cultural

65
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,829
like they're more they rely more on the

66
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,950
state to protect the people or something

67
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:13,010
like this they seem to have some

68
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,619
reliance on that while I'm personally a

69
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,620
very way of governments and things like

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,569
this but some countries it seems to be

71
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,940
like they trust more like that estate or

72
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,899
something and they trust that the

73
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,040
government is going to do the right

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,660
thing for the people or something

75
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,910
maybe something along those lines but

76
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,650
I'm speculating yeah not sure would you

77
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,260
say that there's a difference between

78
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,269
the South Korean app and Chinese app

79
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,888
which seems to be more geared toward

80
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,380
surveilling a specific part of the

81
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,660
population yeah I mean they have really

82
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,190
nothing to do like one thing like a

83
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,168
South Korean have was more about

84
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,590
protecting the children you know in

85
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:50,799
theory and that was the intention to

86
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,900
avoid that children look at you know

87
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,359
adult content or they use the phone and

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,120
I wanted hours or control what apps they

89
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:02,389
have install things like this so it was

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,970
supposed to protect the people the

91
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:06,980
problem is it was a government contract

92
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,450
so they got the they gave the contract

93
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,448
to the he'll always be there I think

94
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,918
yeah of course they did a crappy job and

95
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:14,599
we found a lot of vulnerabilities on

96
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,630
that app anything you can talk about

97
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,750
yeah it's all public so yeah we can talk

98
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,030
about merciful a few what

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,840
it was really broken like at the

100
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,780
beginning the first in the first round

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,630
it was using clear text HTTP yeah so

102
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,909
like all the traffic in this hub that is

103
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,860
supposed to protect children was in the

104
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,500
clear so if the child or the parent were

105
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,360
in a coffee shop or something you would

106
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
see like as they logging like the

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,140
password and the phone number

108
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,660
personality and yeah not great another

109
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,690
funny finding we had was what we call

110
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,180
the bully the bully API you know like a

111
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,890
bully for those who are not native

112
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,690
English speakers like me maybe they

113
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,210
don't know it's like this kind of guy in

114
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,760
the class that piece screws around with

115
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,020
all the other red tries to make the life

116
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,630
of every other child in the class

117
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,570
miserable so this kind of child had this

118
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:16,190
API with his app that they could call

119
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,650
and you could ask it like hey this is

120
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,200
the name of the the phone number of the

121
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,299
child I want to mess with and then the

122
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,680
API will tell you okay this is the

123
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,780
parent phone number and with that you

124
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,640
can already do a lot of damage yeah but

125
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,590
the other all the only other thing you

126
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,500
needed to login as a parent in the

127
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,020
system was the pin of the parent because

128
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,330
once you have the parent phone number

129
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,729
you only needed the password and then

130
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,859
you were in right which was actually the

131
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:47,530
first version was just a pin four digits

132
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,510
so yeah yeah not a lot of security but

133
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:54,320
the funny thing is it the the API not

134
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,300
only gave you the phone number of the

135
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,919
parent it also gave you the the pin as

136
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,380
well in clear-text

137
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,599
so that's why we called it the bully API

138
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,570
because it gave you like everything

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,280
well like only knowing the phone number

140
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,520
of the child you want mess within the

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,400
class it would give you like the phone

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,930
number and the pin of the parent so you

143
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,450
could logging in the system as the

144
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,460
parent from there you can do like all

145
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,110
kinds of nasty stuff to the tail because

146
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,270
of course the app was to control the

147
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,740
phone usage so you could like for

148
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,919
example say oh this child is not allowed

149
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,599
to use the phone all day or you know or

150
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,930
anything or they cannot use like any of

151
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,000
the cool apps that they like you could

152
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,060
like really mess a lot

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,950
and yeah so we called it a bully API for

154
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,560
this reason it was perfect for bullies

155
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,960
you know well that's that's just

156
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,150
incredibly bad design yeah yeah we think

157
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,280
it's because they probably put some

158
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,929
intern something developing this because

159
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,969
you could see like a lot of code that

160
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,220
looked like copy places from like Stack

161
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,780
Overflow and stuff like this so it

162
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,550
looked like somebody like out of

163
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,200
University or something like this you

164
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,420
know you also said that about the

165
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,830
Chinese app that yeah it wasn't great I

166
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:09,160
was expecting better yeah yeah and the

167
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,289
there was English constant names which

168
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,900
you yeah presumably and there's English

169
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,730
in the coding yeah I think I think that

170
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,620
might be to do because like how do you

171
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,600
write like Chinese characters in a

172
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,300
sequel light database yeah right like

173
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,530
they have to use normal quote unquote

174
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:29,440
connected normal horse characters right

175
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:31,479
they support Unicode no no yeah but I

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,100
don't know for database column names and

177
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:43,630
stuff like this maybe the kanjis would

178
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:45,520
be a little bit messy right but I was

179
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,960
interesting if there was any obvious

180
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,539
signs that he had been development by

181
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,390
non Chinese but it's probably as Chinese

182
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,360
people using English encoding yeah yeah

183
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,940
I think so but we can only speculate

184
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:06,040
yeah I mean that's it's unclear on the

185
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:09,219
app the apps especially the IAP one it

186
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,470
was huge so yeah it's difficult to jump

187
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,660
to conclusions sure that's an entire

188
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,030
system as well based on another yeah

189
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,740
yeah yeah exactly we we just looked at

190
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,260
the app but it turns out they are

191
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,350
correlating these with Wi-Fi sniffers

192
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,510
with face recognition in CCTV and they

193
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,650
are correlating all this data do you

194
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,840
know if the ijp app is only deployed in

195
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,419
the Xinjiang region or if it's more

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,579
widespread that's the assumption but I'm

197
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,309
really not into politics only did the

198
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,729
technical stuff and to be honest I'm not

199
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,708
really sure about what happens in in

200
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,129
China or anything

201
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,589
as a follow-up to that now that you have

202
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:51,749
been publicly talking about your work

203
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,059
with the Human Rights Watch yes and

204
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:56,459
looking at the Chinese surveillance apps

205
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,469
would you would you say that you

206
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,059
consider yourself a target for Chinese

207
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,059
surveillance or would you be comfortable

208
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:05,910
traveling to China now for example I'm

209
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,740
not really sure because we only did the

210
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,949
technical stuff and I don't think they

211
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,069
really care like if like they can

212
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:18,660
perfectly argue that Google and Facebook

213
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:20,099
know a lot about us yeah I mean even I'm

214
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,618
not saying more than they know about

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,389
their citizens but pretty close right

216
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:27,449
like they really know a lot about us

217
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,639
like what we do or aah so the Western

218
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:34,139
world also has its own problems I don't

219
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:37,970
think say the difference is that that

220
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:40,850
information is voluntarily given yeah

221
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,470
rather than force by police

222
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,050
there's a slight difference but yeah but

223
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,429
but you wouldn't have any qualms about

224
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,128
traveling to China even though you've

225
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:57,660
been public about your parts in these

226
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:59,129
investigations mmm but but yeah it may

227
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,120
be it could be a problem but I don't

228
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:02,550
think they really care

229
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,240
well like it's not Porsche to install

230
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,709
the basic new app maybe but I think I

231
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,050
think they don't really care like why

232
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,300
would they care like it's it's really

233
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:16,429
like we're just like a drop in the ocean

234
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,349
is smart it's like a government's

235
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:22,139
against like some techie guy is like

236
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,699
looking at code like sure what right you

237
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:26,490
know we just answering some questions

238
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,079
like the human rights activists asked

239
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,179
like are they collecting this data yes

240
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,549
no we look to the code we say yes no

241
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,889
yeah he's not going to put me in jail I

242
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:37,439
don't think so I mean but presumably by

243
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,420
presumably they they guessed that

244
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,929
eventually someone in the western states

245
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,689
would look at that it's not not so

246
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:47,790
surprising really yeah but maybe but I

247
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:48,929
don't think they would be like so I

248
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,020
don't know maybe I'm like too

249
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,900
benevolently them

250
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,819
maybe the the Human Rights Watch people

251
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:58,250
have more of a reason to yeah I think

252
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,630
they are more in there from line is what

253
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,390
I said in the talk like they were really

254
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,439
they're the people like you know risking

255
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,660
their lives and everything else like

256
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,640
we're just answering questions looking

257
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,370
at : certain questions I don't think we

258
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,660
are really a target it will be more like

259
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,640
the human rights activists that are

260
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,750
taking the risk and doing all the hard

261
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,610
work yeah so I mean some of the viewers

262
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,950
and this will will have seen the talk

263
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:27,020
and some of them will not have seen the

264
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:30,770
talk so basically you you looked at two

265
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,400
different apps for the shinies security

266
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:37,189
state one of them being an ax used by

267
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,180
police on on their phones yeah where

268
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:44,900
they did various things like report

269
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:49,339
blood type and the hi monitor power

270
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,240
usage one theory presented was by one of

271
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,110
the audience was that they watch for

272
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,330
power because it might be related to

273
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,520
Bitcoin mining or something and but

274
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:06,470
apparently the shiny state cares about

275
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,160
how your power changes I think it makes

276
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,730
some sense

277
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,230
like if somebody you know like I'm just

278
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,460
trying to think like them right like

279
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,440
you're going to try to guess what

280
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,760
they're thinking is and I think if

281
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,670
somebody is somebody's doing something

282
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,780
funny in their home like some of these

283
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,000
electricity bill like jumps like

284
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,360
multiplies by four or something yeah

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,880
that might be a miracle legitimate is a

286
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,650
legitimate concern for being like what

287
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,210
what they are - right like I think it's

288
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:37,160
clever I don't know yeah yeah I think it

289
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,990
makes sense like yeah if they don't have

290
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,480
like privacy laws and all this like we

291
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,710
then why not you know like if if they

292
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,600
are into like gathering all these

293
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:49,279
intelligence and if you don't care about

294
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:53,459
em high noise here

295
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,920
so factors because that will probably

296
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,989
spike for people who install a sauna or

297
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,680
something but they don't care that they

298
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:04,010
send police to investigate people yeah

299
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:11,160
yeah they don't have the sort of the

300
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:17,389
respect or care just got interrupted by

301
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:20,790
another podcaster and there was

302
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:24,540
something they forced people to install

303
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:28,290
on their phones the last one day be a bx

304
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,089
aq1 yeah yeah that was well it it I

305
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,800
think it's not really they forced people

306
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,690
to install it is more like you have to

307
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,160
give them your phone unlocked yeah and

308
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,380
then they install the app they grab the

309
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,000
data they they uninstall the app and

310
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,040
they give you the phone back also it's

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,899
like a one-time thing yeah it's it's

312
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
more like that you just handing them

313
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,829
over the phone they gather the data they

314
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,709
care about and then they give you your

315
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:53,060
phone back so one thinks it's collected

316
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:57,779
various things but what about your phone

317
00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:00,300
including what CPU ABI it was running

318
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:02,939
yeah that almost sounds like they're

319
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,219
trying to figure out if you're

320
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,920
vulnerable to exploits in the future or

321
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,480
something maybe but in Android the sly

322
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,660
so many exploits to choose from yeah

323
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,769
just recently we saw the the exploit

324
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,490
change for iOS as well

325
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:33,029
yeah that were used presumably by

326
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:35,040
Chinese government yeah this might be

327
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:37,620
one of the bridges to make sure that you

328
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,060
launched the correct and run exploit

329
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,149
which will actually work on that

330
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:48,469
document it's not an argument against

331
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:51,389
monoculture yeah yeah cool man

332
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,860
that's very interesting and actually one

333
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,660
Kristen about the bx8 queue after you

334
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,310
know how prevalent it is so you have

335
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,060
that to be forced to install on your

336
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,630
phone do you have any idea I was on the

337
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,619
technical team so I'm not really sure

338
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,170
from I think that I think based on what

339
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,650
we heard it seems to be quite widespread

340
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,290
and I think it makes sense like if they

341
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,360
if they don't have privacy laws and they

342
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,150
are into trying to find like potential

343
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,190
like radical Islamic terrorism and they

344
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,840
don't have this loss then why not you

345
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,090
know that might be their thinking you

346
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,720
know yeah probably I mean if I mean it's

347
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,310
the kind of data that the NSA another

348
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,990
like government agencies in the u.s.

349
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,790
were found to be collecting as well like

350
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,890
who talks to who like these are all the

351
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,890
kind of police kind of intelligence they

352
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,530
want so from a police and investigation

353
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,050
point of view I think it makes sense to

354
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:48,260
try I mean it's of course a privacy

355
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,680
concern sure but from the government

356
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,580
point of view and try to stop like

357
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,760
extremists and things like this I think

358
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,140
it makes total sense to to try to see

359
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,450
who talks to who and try to find

360
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,310
anomalies and try to do all this big

361
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,170
data analysis to try it out to me the

362
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,569
whole thing and stop terrorist attack

363
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,860
before it happens I don't think is the

364
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,410
right thing to do right

365
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,540
that's what I understand I mean yeah my

366
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,819
personal opinion is I don't think is

367
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:17,060
right to do this because it's a privacy

368
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,280
concern yeah but I understand why they

369
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,589
are potentially doing it yes because

370
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:24,949
they probably can catch a lot of stuff

371
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,780
like that and we're just stuff that

372
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,940
stuff that you would miss for sure yeah

373
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,550
if you wouldn't do it of course the

374
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,980
trade-off is you are like invading the

375
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,620
privacy of people that's not cool but I

376
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:42,320
understand why if you're that kind of

377
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:44,690
state then you would just have to hope I

378
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,470
guess that they're actually storing the

379
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,990
data securely so that it doesn't end up

380
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,730
even more people

381
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:58,010
yeah they debate database sample like

382
00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:00,520
that would be master was an issue a

383
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:03,980
couple of months ago where some Chinese

384
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,170
monitoring system got really dumb

385
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:10,010
I don't recall exactly what it was but

386
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:12,020
they it was one system which was found

387
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,530
and you could download things from it

388
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,139
well not surprising everything gets high

389
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,930
eventually I guess yeah matter of time

390
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,490
yeah all right Abe thank you very much

391
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,260
for joining us thank you and enjoy the

392
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,380
rest of the conference thank you very

393
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,379
