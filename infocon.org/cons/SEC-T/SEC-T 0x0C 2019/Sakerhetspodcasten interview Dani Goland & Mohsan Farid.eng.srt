1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,840
so hello and welcome to this special

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,390
with second it's podcast on insecty we

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,039
are interviewing some of the speakers on

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,300
on the conference and now we're having

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:23,929
Daniel and back for the second time

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:25,609
today and mohchung free welcome yeah

7
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,409
really nice having you here yeah it was

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:30,769
a cool talk it was a little bit about

9
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:33,100
everything it was some exploitation and

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:36,379
some post exploitation and then some

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,420
hardening and takeaways on how you

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,550
should manage your resources in the

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,910
cloud and how you shouldn't man how you

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:47,360
should enjoy cloud and I think most of

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,760
her so like we actually got to this talk

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,550
he's an internal pentester yeah I'm not

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,000
I've never worked like a tea I did write

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,970
web pen test and a pen testing cloud

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,100
because so as a CTO I work in our

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,250
infrastructure DevOps deficit cops yeah

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,500
and I enjoy having my nights and trying

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,880
to break our own cloud so that's how I

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,920
found a bunch of vulnerabilities all

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,289
right all right tools to like mitigate

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,110
that and then we spoke about it and

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,750
we're like companies are moving these

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,550
days to the cloud yeah sure but then the

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,960
move is not it was actually a question

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,850
from DEFCON we were speaking in that

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,339
from cloud village and someone asked me

31
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,080
like how why is there connection between

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,630
them and then you think about it a

33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,090
company cannot go cloud native in a day

34
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,310
right no no they can be a company or it

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,870
is a progression yeah yeah so while the

36
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,170
progression they'll have some kind of

37
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,630
tunnel yeah between yes we were talking

38
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,549
about let's go through that tunnel let's

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,740
try to because see what we can build out

40
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:48,590
as I feel it's like less mature in terms

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,539
of protection then I mean you've had

42
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,100
both yes and no like if you're if you

43
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,990
really want to protect your stuff in

44
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,759
navy as you can but it's a lot of work

45
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,130
so people tend not to maybe implement

46
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,750
all of it sure but in terms of products

47
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,339
as well like figure out how many parties

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,229
you have four on-premise well yeah

49
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,720
that's that's not sure like for an

50
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:07,039
internal Active Directory topology there

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,919
is a lot of stuff and there's a lot of

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,810
mitigations in place as well but the

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,299
funny part with Windows applications or

54
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,250
the Microsoft realm

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,320
of managing assets in an enterprise

56
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,250
right it's pretty hard because they need

57
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,350
to be backwards culpability issues yeah

58
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,390
you sort of showed a lot of broadcasting

59
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,000
protocols that are easily exploited and

60
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,649
I think the twist where you're talking

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,650
about having a VP C or a site-to-site

62
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,840
VPN to your cloud native environment

63
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,490
that sort of is a really good vector

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,370
because it's really value a it could

65
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,640
happen and also though I notice more

66
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,690
cloud right you got new services a new

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,079
everybody calls every day and like a new

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,230
survey tested but we don't have enough

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
people like security people like going

70
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,950
at all these new services because every

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,230
day I wake up I go to the AWS trance or

72
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,510
something new thing pops up yeah I see a

73
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,340
version two point three point two of a

74
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,320
new API call for something with another

75
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,630
and like another field you know yeah

76
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,940
what happens to be fuzz downfield yeah

77
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,519
does anyone test it nope take all the

78
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,040
minutes it takes time exactly so I feel

79
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,530
that getting dirt loud and we showed you

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,230
like three ways of doing the easiest way

81
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,510
like a distillation attack which is been

82
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,000
available for years but once I got into

83
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,429
the cloud and then he's sorta attacking

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,320
the ad FS proxy yeah and we turned into

85
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,760
the internal I mean there is something

86
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,680
that I don't think anyone's prepared for

87
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,480
no I don't think anyone's prepared for

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,459
is someone coming from their cloud into

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,410
the internal that's sort of it's sort of

90
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,690
a thing now isn't it like in the before

91
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,549
times we we talked about an inside and

92
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,560
an outside of the corporate network and

93
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,630
then we sort of evolved and deploying

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,060
sone concepts right we have different

95
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,220
zones like teams Ed's and whatnot and

96
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,020
then we invented the cloud and then we

97
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,410
sort of reinvented the inside-outside

98
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:00,160
again but with the same problematic

99
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,540
image with corporates and like networks

100
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,090
it needs to be interconnected in a way

101
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,859
so we sort of created a more complex

102
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,320
environment everyone could say right and

103
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,840
that's I think you're talking sort of

104
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,359
summons that up pretty neatly like we

105
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,470
have internal stuff but it's more or

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,680
less reachable from public clouds yeah a

107
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,290
false impression of security with the

108
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,840
cloud gap where people think that

109
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:29,230
their assets in the cloud are completely

110
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,780
isolated from their internal which we

111
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,340
just demonstrated no it's it's not no

112
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,890
and they also think when their own in

113
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,419
ec2 instance that it's protected but

114
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,150
once there's a patch out there's like a

115
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,350
vulnerability its responsibility watch

116
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,880
it if you don't have a marriage service

117
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,060
yeah in the shared model you're all

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,340
responsible for yeah I was emphasizing

119
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,600
how I mean every you do patching

120
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,340
and like weren't like patching

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,990
everything but I was emphasizing how I

122
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,880
think patching is the wrong way to do

123
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,090
this yeah because we're running in VMs

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,610
click recent getting a new image and a

125
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,039
vm is fast it's not like we started a

126
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,750
hundred computers right VMs are fast if

127
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,400
you're eating like docker it's you know

128
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,830
faster yeah thirty minutes are up time

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,900
yeah so just get up the new base image

130
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,880
put a patch in there and then replace

131
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,530
everything so you know that everything

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,969
is running on you but it depends on what

133
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,710
what service you're running if you are

134
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,980
like this hip young company or like I

135
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,750
not look young like you developed DevOps

136
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,120
pipeline so you have everything you have

137
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,400
scriptable infrastructure you have a

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,870
build service like you have circle CR

139
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,609
you have something that's employs code

140
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,590
then I think it will make sense but you

141
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,470
have a lot of big enterprises they're

142
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:41,469
running like fat and thick kind right

143
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:42,730
yeah running bespoke yeah yeah then

144
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,160
they're on the other machine that

145
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,130
machine has an Amazon machine image

146
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,110
yeah sure so but then then it will be

147
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,770
harder to define a docker image and be

148
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,740
harder to I'm not talking about docker

149
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,840
a operating system yeah the Linux you

150
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,460
harden it with one of those there's a

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,960
bunch of ansible oh yeah you mean and

152
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,909
have it does your private ami or

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,539
something yeah what'd you bake your own

154
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,979
AMI

155
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:07,280
yeah every time there's a vulnerability

156
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,419
you don't patch an existing machine you

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,068
bacon you am I

158
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,990
yeah there is Pat I mean I can swap it

159
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,659
yeah right you can yeah we can have your

160
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,300
monolith cuz cuz that sometime you just

161
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,190
swap them yeah and that will be that way

162
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,960
you know the you know patches might fail

163
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,789
yeah right and you have to manage that

164
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,008
yeah but once you bake an ami and it

165
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,440
works and you just swap it on all your

166
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,419
machines yeah it makes sense

167
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,009
it makes sense but a lot like kernel

168
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,409
hardening if you run Linux it's like

169
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,810
really important like really removing

170
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,550
all the bad file permissions that might

171
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,319
exist so that's that makes sense and you

172
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,340
have your base image do it up once and

173
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,710
then roll everything Packer

174
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,340
which gives you a stager it takes you

175
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,068
you say you take like the base a window

176
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,840
image by edible yes it runs it on

177
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:55,819
machine and then you give it a bunch of

178
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,099
stages that you want to do so I put

179
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:01,819
ansible strips through harden the kernel

180
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:04,610
yeah it's just CTL and yeah maybe you do

181
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,009
your chrome works and you do file system

182
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,440
permissions you can do custom scripts

183
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,180
you can do ansible you can do how's

184
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,969
your corpus actually they're doing good

185
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,099
stuff both is a really good product in

186
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:18,380
conjunction with TMS or parameter store

187
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:22,099
or something yes yes you want syllable

188
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,800
jam is what you should do but again also

189
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,169
you have things in in hash Europe that I

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,440
don't like yeah that they give you the

191
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,520
easiness so if you're on console and you

192
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,860
want to do service discovery

193
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,690
yeah they can give you the ec2 service

194
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,639
strawberry yep that means you have to

195
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,949
give describe tags and describe

196
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,110
instances yep to each instance yeah if

197
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,819
you give them an attacker gets in one of

198
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,380
your instances describe instances lets

199
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,389
you read all these are data

200
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,699
yeah well all the end yeah yeah which

201
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:51,380
can contain a lot of stuff yeah so this

202
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,380
is like the easiness they give you yeah

203
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,759
but it comes with a great risk that they

204
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,469
don't specify the doctor but it's the

205
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,849
same with versioning and index and if

206
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,240
you're storing your terraform state

207
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:01,430
files

208
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,930
you know it's unsecured matter you will

209
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,700
have more or less console output you

210
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,310
will have everything

211
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,110
that that terraforming scripted true

212
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,210
yeah so that's that's an important thing

213
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,160
to really take care of as well you don't

214
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,630
want that little thing yeah but the

215
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,580
problem for me they give you the

216
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,010
easiness to do it yeah because to do it

217
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,719
without doing the autodiscover with easy

218
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,300
to yeah it's a pain yeah yeah it's

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,040
harder but if it's doable but it's

220
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,840
harder it's doable yeah but when you

221
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,220
have the ec2 when someone compromises a

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,320
machine and you can read all the user

223
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,400
data from all your machines yeah he will

224
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,460
find something yep

225
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,640
most definitely I think the easiest kind

226
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,470
of a big risk um you shouldn't they

227
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,909
always read the production hardening

228
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,010
guides because they're always at the end

229
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,839
at some point but you need a maturity

230
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,950
level to do that as well as your

231
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,740
components like fixing SMB yeah like

232
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,540
relay attacks like yeah we patched a lot

233
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,640
of stuff but as you said some of the

234
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,099
patches were incomplete right yeah but

235
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,210
we still in my opinion you have to

236
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,740
correct me if I'm wrong but there's

237
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,610
still a lot of companies out there

238
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,580
running SMB one I was gonna say it's

239
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,680
enough to have one old server in an ad

240
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,260
environment and you're basically the

241
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,630
throwing around until them hashes all I

242
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,220
need is one yeah right guy that's again

243
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:24,970
where do you say the version one of was

244
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:27,430
it he says like stop it if you run me me

245
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:31,600
can see it like you almost always find a

246
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,819
digest password even now yeah yeah so I

247
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,550
mean the thing is is the whole like in

248
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,950
my in our talk I showed how I was able

249
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,890
to get 60 shells and 36 yeah it's crazy

250
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,550
but but the reality situation is I just

251
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,870
need one

252
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,370
yeah yeah yeah you know what attacked

253
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,710
the directory environment I just need

254
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,779
one shown and the rest is all gone yeah

255
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:53,170
it's a domino

256
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,300
yeah absolutely and I mean that's it's

257
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,040
that's your that's the trade-off that

258
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,560
you have with Active Directory right you

259
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,410
have that convenience but in the event

260
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,498
that it's compromised then it's all

261
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,809
going and it's sort of like you don't

262
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:10,720
even have to have like really nice

263
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:13,629
credentials anyway because it is uh it's

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,579
based out of reading attributes so every

265
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,889
user needs to be able to read the Active

266
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,729
Directory database right so you know

267
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,499
where to look

268
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,689
so if you compromise one machine you

269
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:25,389
have all the access to actually know

270
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:28,240
where to look next and that's really the

271
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:33,550
neat part so yeah it's a fun with the

272
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,499
neat part for the red team you know he

273
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,359
showed you all the stuff on internals

274
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:41,980
and there's a bunch of companies doing

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,139
internal Penta yeah I have not seen that

276
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,319
many companies doing like AWS Penta

277
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:49,269
right no there's really tryna do it our

278
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,550
company where I work are you a lot of

279
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:54,009
them yeah every week almost I compare

280
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,040
that to like internal yeah yeah not even

281
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:58,449
questions because of that even the

282
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,129
amount of research we have on

283
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,899
vulnerabilities yeah right as low

284
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,000
because if you have like three companies

285
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,319
or like let's say I'm gonna go like 50

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,939
companies in their world versus like

287
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:09,579
thousands doing that yeah yeah and like

288
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:11,889
preempt I don't think they're probably

289
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:14,920
doing internal right I mean most of the

290
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,959
research is about ad or they have a

291
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,490
product but you know how things are

292
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,680
cloud so the amount of research amount

293
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,970
of like manpower and hours that's what

294
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,910
we're getting we're getting a lot of

295
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,069
like abs say more or less implemented

296
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,139
security features like aqua security

297
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:31,229
does a lot of a mice that you can

298
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:34,990
install directly into the cloud yeah

299
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,939
yeah you have you have Falco insisting

300
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,759
they're maybe not the best but they're

301
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:44,349
still there Falco and Cystic okay so

302
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:47,410
it's like well it's not like it's sort

303
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,149
of it's a anomaly detection more or less

304
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,429
we can talk a little bit more about that

305
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,679
off-camera but they're they're they're

306
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:57,699
really they just been accepted into the

307
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,670
CNF non-native foundation and and they

308
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:02,899
argue they they will be good eventually

309
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:05,180
but not I not really mature

310
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,430
probably the cloud native foundation

311
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:11,029
yeah it's not a big problem I'm just

312
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,670
saying the day the acceptance rate right

313
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,709
you draw look at the landscape for every

314
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,899
leg typical there you have like 50

315
00:12:15,709 --> 00:12:20,779
solutions yeah yeah and when you have

316
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,759
that there's 50 solutions with 50

317
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,139
different places to look for new

318
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,069
vulnerabilities because people are

319
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,980
eyeing that yeah right

320
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,628
once you kind of like get closer and

321
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,639
like that's why I like console or like

322
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:34,249
you have console sto and they cling to

323
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,699
right they're like the most most people

324
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:39,350
are running them yeah so you can test

325
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,878
these and you'll find like the

326
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,009
vulnerabilities and fix them but once

327
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,009
you have like a hundred of the like

328
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:48,499
Microsoft's aprox yeah it's very hard to

329
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,899
like look at one of them the the world

330
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:53,179
of kubernetes and orchestrations are at

331
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:55,279
their door and it's getting adopted in a

332
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:58,279
rate that we can't even comprehend so

333
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,249
well I think we will not be out of a job

334
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,990
soon oh yeah yeah the more there is the

335
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:04,879
more I'm gonna look for things right I

336
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,389
they console my next thing will be steel

337
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:11,839
look for how to break that and like you

338
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,540
know every new thing comes out and I'm a

339
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,649
developer so I know that I make

340
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,019
viability my code

341
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,300
yeah so and people found viable in my

342
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:23,149
code and it's fine it's like no one's

343
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:26,449
perfect I think you know people are more

344
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:29,149
concerned about preventing that initial

345
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:30,889
point of compromise but there's really

346
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,929
nothing you can do about that it's

347
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:36,139
inevitable I forget what's a very

348
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:38,029
important and highly like underestimated

349
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,749
as far as the amount of value that it

350
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:44,029
offers is having telemetry like you know

351
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:46,970
like for my particular attack that I

352
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,709
demonstrated yes I use an undetectable

353
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,670
payload you're not able to see the

354
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:56,179
traffic you weren't able to see anything

355
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,809
going across the wire but why were there

356
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:02,119
60 server 60 systems reverse connecting

357
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,860
to me yes so yeah that's that's the

358
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:06,199
thing like you need to have some kind of

359
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,040
man am I normally detection there there

360
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,140
is no reason yeah

361
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,030
there is no reason like this server is

362
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,560
trying to Lagoon every user in the

363
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:21,449
active directory under five minutes

364
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:24,119
right I think you don't even need that

365
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,130
you need like a threshold like you

366
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:34,880
should yeah so you're sort of rate limit

367
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:34,880
everything feels like it's not even

368
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,260
anything it's like a rule that are but

369
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,180
that's a Windows box No

370
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,520
so it's shouts like an old lady so

371
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,410
there's a lot about casting happening

372
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,870
right so if you have one looked at a

373
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,280
peek at Microsoft topology or network

374
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,390
there is a lot of everything is

375
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,280
everything so yeah yeah that's sort of

376
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,900
yeah but I think that's that's a good

377
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,540
takeaway because there there are some

378
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,510
fairly simple metrics that you could

379
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,930
something new no I mean we were doing

380
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,610
this adopt defense-in-depth Yard

381
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,270
privilege or at least privilege policies

382
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,490
so yeah and and so I'd know the things

383
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,470
that you're running don't be crazy

384
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,360
stupid don't be an early adopter of

385
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:26,280
something that you don't know check it

386
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,060
yeah validate or if you're using my shop

387
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,370
if you're if you're taking down PHP to a

388
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:34,170
framework from some guy in Russia maybe

389
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,630
not be the valid source check out the

390
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,120
source where are you pulling supply

391
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,220
chain yeah for sure best when you have

392
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,010
like circle CI which pulls things coming

393
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,260
a get like get the hash and compare it

394
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,210
before you write because if some if

395
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,430
someone gets their key and pushes

396
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,430
something to their brain you're screwed

397
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,410
yeah exact the same thing I would say

398
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,089
like it's with NPM looks like on event

399
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,040
stream which is like it was the most

400
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,110
popular library

401
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,509
it's an NPM and the developer is like a

402
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,759
bender there's like a practice yeah and

403
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:10,560
some dude is like I want it and he put

404
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,610
something that targeted like a specific

405
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,380
coin exchange to like poison to inject

406
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,970
like code and through the mobile app you

407
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,569
know dr. about the same thing they

408
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,610
removed thousands of really really they

409
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,529
were compromised containers that people

410
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,529
use yeah cuz they didn't do their

411
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,660
homework the industry needs to mature

412
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,850
yeah I think one of the biggest issues

413
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,350
with industry right now with I've seen

414
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,500
from my personal experiences that

415
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,019
organizations post pen test they're

416
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,720
gonna say what they always ask me what

417
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,670
products can i buy yeah to prevent this

418
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,069
and I'm like don't worry about your

419
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,560
products put that money in training your

420
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:51,719
people yeah yeah that's a good way good

421
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,268
as the people who deployed yeah

422
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,430
configure it like don't worry about

423
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,899
getting the latest product don't know

424
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,370
don't worry about it and it's a cultural

425
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,740
thing as well like we need to implement

426
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,360
non blame policy that everyone is like

427
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,299
it doesn't matter where you find the

428
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,939
bugs we will help it out each other to

429
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,689
fix it you train every person yeah like

430
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,760
the secretary

431
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,679
you know everyone everybody look at our

432
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,359
talk from before ago but the apt right

433
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,150
yeah yeah beer fishing yeah

434
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,438
they got and they use the MC bypass you

435
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,530
can see in their script how they

436
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,600
bypassed MC was like splitting the

437
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,309
PowerShell command classic way to do it

438
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,349
right now right and it will spearfishing

439
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,049
and spearfishing will always stay so

440
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:33,449
yeah I mean right someone will get

441
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:35,400
foothold somehow yeah you have to expect

442
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:38,340
that yeah it's just a matter of time to

443
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,409
detect it right and how not to constrict

444
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,689
them from moving laterally and what but

445
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,549
yeah and when you yeah sure yeah I think

446
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,890
that's that's a really good note to end

447
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:50,070
this conversation I think we can sit

448
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:55,020
here and talk yeah but the listeners

449
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,970
might might not be so Danny and Mo thank

450
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,320
you so much taking the time to talk to

451
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,559

452
