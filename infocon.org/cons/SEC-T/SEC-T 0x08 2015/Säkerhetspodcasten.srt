1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,759
on their RSS feeds later so give it up
for why is a sexy podcast good morning

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,710
sixty of you guys are feeling better
than I am too much sleep but I hope

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,710
you're ready for this podcast
extravaganza this often is gonna

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,019
introduce the panel under them over and
with me I had yes yes and we have Peter

5
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:33,570
says hi there

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,969
Richard hello there and chantix
something as well as you let us know we

7
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,660
be doing onstage today

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,610
firstly I think that since some of you
actually know who is this second

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,769
broadcasting crew is could skip
introducing ourselves but we need more

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,149
information about Phoenix I think who
are you so I'm going to smoke a

11
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,320
conference yesterday round

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,780
yeah I do a podcast I thought offered
really good intentions of doing the show

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,270
once a week that lasted all of about
three months and then we will read

14
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,160
nickname Phoenix tak whenever it kind of
is our master so yeah we vote in

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,979
tattered new podcast new panels in
interviews and all that good stuff so

16
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,320
last night when we or or perhaps even
yesterday we were planning this we

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,309
thought that perhaps we should involve
the crew the visitors at secretary and

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,440
ask them to ask some questions and we
Twitter hashtag and we got a huge

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:51,649
response huge response to questions but
since we're six of us I think that two

20
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:58,619
questions in 40 minutes deaths that
splendid maybe one too many as in case

21
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,520
we run out of questions you know just
raise your hand will get you a

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,740
microphone and you'll be able to ask
questions like are you guys that

23
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,239
underlie feed you'll have two tweeters
the first question is from marketing

24
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,540
else telling how she named em loudly and
he has a question actually regarding

25
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,230
your presentation

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,980
yesterday the next its host moral moment
what could or should the security

27
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,679
community due to counter the evil uses
of research findings

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,640
well since you're an expert on the
subject what's your opinion because I am

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,988
I right in thinking that the question
says illegal use of research I think we

30
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:57,190
should probably illegal we should become
carpenters and you know the world would

31
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,220
be a safer place it'll be good but yeah
I mean it's an interesting problem right

32
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,870
because technology requires innovation
is part of what we do but yeah when not

33
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,030
always in control of where that
innovation goes so yeah it is down to us

34
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,400
it's down to the down to security
professionals and practitioners to have

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,220
at least some one of control over what
we do it's not just about let's do

36
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,690
something cool because as I said
yesterday were not is not partying in

37
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,109
the desert anymore you know this stuff
to do you know the stuff that we do has

38
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,109
an impact I know that people find
offensive

39
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,790
offensive research

40
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:54,030
research to be sexy and I can understand
their duties as well as you know we have

41
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,709
a real crime victims I ever have a brand
problem in security right where

42
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:06,849
offensive security is cool and defensive
securities bori which is really not the

43
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,369
case is not real you know defenses are
really really cool if we spend as much

44
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,280
time as much resources on defense as we
did on attack the world would be a

45
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,539
better place right you know your group
young mother would be able to use pgp by

46
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:28,090
now so yeah I mean that's why of my
views on Delta beginning views I but

47
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,489
what do you guys think about what we we
actually had an episode about this when

48
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,560
we discuss like the moral issues of
vulnerability research and what might

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,260
that research can be used for and I
think it was kind of a hung jury because

50
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,139
I mean some some of us and ended the
discussion continued after the podcast

51
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,510
where some of us are that it was
completely ok to do sell exploits and

52
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:07,490
and other considered this to be somewhat
immoral because even though they're the

53
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,960
use may be justifiable in

54
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,599
the legal sense because it's used for
countering crime and so on and so forth

55
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,190
I think it was still there there's this
doubt that you know all that all

56
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,919
governments have a common sense and
common sense is not very common

57
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,639
especially not in governments but as
long as our researches open to some

58
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,880
extent we share our results we can
really be expected to to control what

59
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,770
people do with their research I mean
people will be evil whether we like it

60
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,299
or not so we can start researching new
abilities or or not disclose their

61
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,430
findings which is not a good way to go
either know but I still think it's it's

62
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:07,970
it's a matter of being ultra responsible
and culture responsible disclosure yeah

63
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,940
I mean it's it's about giving giving the
industries in time on the other hand you

64
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,500
need to put pressure on them because
otherwise speaking from experience they

65
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,930
won't fix that security vulnerability
I'll try responsibility closure that's a

66
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,180
way for when you come in finding
vulnerabilities and disclosing them to

67
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,210
the vendors but what about exploit
development could you could use a

68
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,799
morally defend exploit development in
any scenario that's a business model

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,480
whatever

70
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,350
let's do it for free let's not talk
about the money you find invulnerability

71
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:54,060
you produce an exploit and then you give
it to someone let's say easy cases like

72
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,840
okay you you give you a clue work for
the government or the law enforcement

73
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,919
the local law enforcement agency and you
develop and exploit for them to be able

74
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,830
to intercept communications from
organized crime that seems like a pretty

75
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:14,520
moral good way to go right so the
interesting part of an employee or

76
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,870
buchanan statement was let's forget
about the money and the problem is is

77
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,090
that money rules the world around you

78
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,810
of course and the people that are
advising governments have a vested

79
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:34,580
interest in advising defensive measures
right that we had you know you take road

80
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:42,150
safety advice from car manufacturers
take security advice from weapon is like

81
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,140
polar bears voting for no carbon
emissions you know they're not gonna

82
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,530
turn around and say the world is safe
you know by the way can we just have the

83
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,150
fifty billion from nothing

84
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,580
yeah yeah when we come to cyber warfare
I'm totally with you but let's go for

85
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,430
easier and more down-to-earth example
like law enforcement agency needing to

86
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,680
22 counted the advanced criminals in our
society

87
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,190
they've always had to have always had
comparison tools of intercepted mouse

88
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,560
different dissented telephone
communications have intercepted wires

89
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,170
radio transmissions that if we look
throughout history we

90
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:26,570
they've been at the forefront of enter
set the intercept is but that's a me and

91
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,520
my guys in the terrorist cells seconds
but costs and reuse my message

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,149
and enjoy one of the small and now they
want to sort of the local law

93
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,089
enforcement wants to get a hold of our
communications and and without a good

94
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,190
tool to crack the latest iPhone they
won't get older if they had to give

95
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,050
Apple a call

96
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,510
yeah let's say Apple is one of the good
guys just for argument's sake so I

97
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,870
worked my angle is is there a valid and
morally OK

98
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,990
scenario where explosive element is ok
for asking if the ends justify the means

99
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:18,800
likes this this is a really loud just
whenever whenever you hear the term you

100
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,609
gotta break some eggs to make a left at
a good sign to turn around and walk away

101
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,510
I yeah

102
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,649
questions just out of curiosity how do
you define morality is that with

103
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,170
Indonesian order or international
because different nations kind of

104
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,380
defined differently

105
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:43,089
yeah yeah that's a very very good
according to think it's more a case to

106
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:52,040
spy on your list so it's entirely up to
you to define what more on this day I i

107
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,160
recognizes is a really complex issue but
for me I'm trying to be to be able to

108
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,709
sort of generally confined space find
some truth I'm trying to look at sort of

109
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,849
a local Swedish problem whether perhaps
this week police would like to

110
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,810
do some civilians of a local criminals
I'm I'm skipping on the cyber and the

111
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,119
United States save the world and all
that stuff and just looking at a local

112
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,389
EC problem like enhancing creating
better tools for local law enforcement

113
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,199
and then of course only answered that
question you can go into a really

114
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:34,949
complex discussions about ok that the
wider moral implications of that one

115
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,609
another comment

116
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,569
question is the idea of ETA you start
talking about organized crime and the

117
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:48,160
question is if you look back at the
history of people doing these things in

118
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,290
terms of digging into people's privacy

119
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,120
most of it goes into a lot of government
policies that were questionable in the

120
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,899
first place

121
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:03,199
foreign policy right here on C
international policy international

122
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:10,709
morality drug policy is so we didn't
have to make the FBI the war on drugs we

123
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,839
certainly can justify any whatever we
need to do because it's the war on drugs

124
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:26,699
so how is everything right as the war
going by the way we give up in Sweden I

125
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:31,329
think in the UK as well we introduced
surveillance to

126
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,870
stop

127
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,620
organized crime and foreign military
threats then it turns out that we

128
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,830
actually provide some of it to the tax
department and I don't think anyone here

129
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:51,270
ever sat down and agreed to these rules
we developed for serious serious cases

130
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:59,140
we're now doing it to help get gas or
possibly might be cheating on the tax

131
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,230
let's give our new Xbox to the IRS and
get all the help that you know what I'm

132
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:20,250
hearing from you guys is that ok exploit
development is never okay for someone

133
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,930
who's actually intending to use for for
example law enforcement or for something

134
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,310
else but why would you buy an exploit
that we're going to use but why do you

135
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:39,369
build it because they were planning on
using the minute they went looking this

136
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:45,769
shoot-down go okay I'm not going to let
this go is that ok too

137
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:54,819
exploit development I can see where
where it's a valid point to to at least

138
00:12:54,819 --> 00:13:00,709
create a proof of concept code because
you might have to convince company X

139
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:05,748
that has a vulnerable Pradhan products
and you have to show them that if you do

140
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,970
this this particular way things go bad

141
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:17,869
park or gtfo re so I mean it's it's it's
the one scenario where where I

142
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:25,720
personally would create an exploit or an
attack tool I did you download will get

143
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,130
the feisty plugin

144
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,220
Facebook doing nothing to secure their
communications their website until the

145
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,730
feisty plugin went live and it was very
visual it was very easy for everyone to

146
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,860
understand that this is bad I was that
was developed by Jan so kudos to offend

147
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,960
remembers easy for us to talk about
software you can attach our own personal

148
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:59,150
feelings too is this good software is
this bad so you nothing and maps so

149
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:05,079
weapon defense going to kill people
people we had we had that analogy in

150
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,430
like the arms industry weapon per se is
not neither good or bad

151
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:19,729
shoot it is built to shoot someone you
know my rifles at home they're made for

152
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:36,500
hunting moose but an m16 is another good
example of actually is what is required

153
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,040
is crisp LSX hack this summer because we
actually as a community we new cars were

154
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,740
able to take the dog really is the paper
like three or four years ago with the

155
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,360
exact same results and nothing really
happened

156
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,960
automotive industry straw to looking
into this issues but they didn't really

157
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,570
do it there's a lot of movement in the
automotive industry's right now after

158
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,580
revelations are essentially and that's
really the point there you need to

159
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,450
create something that's that's really
spectacular in order for

160
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,430
the companies with multiple products to
to really do something about it

161
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,390
an entire industry I think of another
question their questions jumps in right

162
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,189
now we have to remember with full
disclosure in these particular cases is

163
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,510
the automobile industry had problems
before hand and they had reasonable

164
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,710
disclosure and rather than reaching for
the developer they reached for the

165
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,010
lawyer and I think a lot of us can argue
that responsible disclosure in in on

166
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:44,430
paper seems a beautiful thing right I'm
going to help you help yourself that the

167
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,339
fact that is being used so that you've
been left with that you're only true

168
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,970
choice now is if you recently disclosed
something you're likely to get your ass

169
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,300
handed to you by a legal team where is a
few full disclosure but you would I

170
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,689
write is over you can't sign as we now
it's our and good luck with your lawyer

171
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,320
and it's a shame because it shows you
how a process that we came up with

172
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,750
business as a community to make things
better

173
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,620
was abused by a legal structure and now
literally we asked to say you know what

174
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,650
that's what we're gonna do this or it's
a shame process raise morale moral

175
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,900
shaming people with the bad guys right
now as well but now I mean I can I can

176
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,250
really relate to that because it is

177
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:38,670
fairly reason as not not so reason
really situation I discovered a

178
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,990
vulnerability in a product and talk to
the company about this and show them

179
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,780
that this is this is this is really bad
you need to do something about it and i

180
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,079
was i was served with a very long letter
from their lawyers telling me you know

181
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:01,960
what they were due to if this came out
so I'm gonna get medieval on this is

182
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:09,550
sort of I'll start out by saying three
Kevin bad it is but the figure bad it is

183
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,899
that's part of moving to Sweden about
five years ago and part of my decision

184
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,000
about it is about never gonna do
security again one of you in the United

185
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,939
States because of the possibility of
getting pregnant jail or getting sued

186
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:27,600
didn't get into nothingness and it's
interesting because I had

187
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,340
discussion group there have to remain a
Muslim lady there was a bunch of people

188
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,668
talking about internet and make the
devices and I was tossing in the bag but

189
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,910
we really needed to worry about the
security and building a security

190
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,559
standard for iit devices yeah and it was
funny because I brought up one of the

191
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,440
things that brought up was the Malaysian
plate and the person immediately with

192
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,950
jumped on me and said you're absolutely
fucking crazy there's no way but I

193
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:02,350
deplane and this is crap and this is
about seven or eight months ago and so

194
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,990
few weeks ago we had a person arrested
in the United States for hacking the

195
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,570
plane had that I've really had to send
your article to him and say okay so they

196
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,189
just arrested somebody very best to be
fair he wasn't arrested he was

197
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,980
questioned detained at the airport when
you talk about Chris Roberts right

198
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:31,950
basis of great info Zach drama where the
InfoSec community spins things something

199
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,640
chronic chris Roberts did write
allegedly

200
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,240
allegedly right now but this is
manhattan plane and fly sideways because

201
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,890
itself full spectrum Simon tackler that
the dude was actually on the plane

202
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,960
how much do you love your research and
not to kill yourself on a plane but the

203
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,150
way that people are talking recklessly
endangered lives

204
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:05,610
yes his jump to conclusions about this
is interesting to you look at the

205
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:14,240
Malaysian Airlines thing that I've been
saying hi if there's a possibility

206
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,250
yeah I mean what's interesting is a
self-fulfilling prophecies on right to

207
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,690
you know one thing we can guarantee is
the planes will be hot now because we

208
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,520
talked about playing now and this will
carry on and perpetually perpetually

209
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,730
until we definitely take a part of the
reason why I went nuts with this case

210
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:43,080
because he said never Boeing 787

211
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,470
basically had the head count about in
there in this software on the plains and

212
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,160
the the fix was you had to reboot 7870
ship like you had to power the thing

213
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,460
down back up again to reset account of
these people are building planes to fly

214
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,850
on overflow but they've had a pretty old
right

215
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:19,219
to listen to that I T support call you
tried turning it on and actually that

216
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,690
question was a really good bridge over
to our next question for today because

217
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,040
we had a question from increased various
order Twitter anyone about the future of

218
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,290
ideas security what software hardware
threats do we see in the next five years

219
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,250
of perhaps ten years and how do we
prepare for them

220
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,260
internet or flying things and that's why
I go down to the question it's like in a

221
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:50,100
lot of things is coming and stuff like
that so what we see in the future with a

222
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,199
private pilot and

223
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:14,649
transmissions and they will lose their
display and so i think there's a lot

224
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:23,000
more scary than reported because since a
result it didn't need to do an emergency

225
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,289
landing the managed to reboot something
in the cockpit and they got there they

226
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,230
could continue like nothing happened and
I'm pretty sure they didn't tell the

227
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,630
passengers back pilots instrumentation
and didn't see a ship because the

228
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,740
screens are black they don't have 0
instruments because it's all

229
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:50,340
computerized cold to the idea support
department so who in there are flying

230
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:59,830
home on Sunday or make sure so what we
see in the future

231
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:09,840
apart from claims with Windows XP
screensavers on them I see your point is

232
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,158
to be in the pivot point from their own
in which I mean to be fair the

233
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,769
internationals is because I P P six
portal is not working I mean this is

234
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:25,019
what it boils down to this is i mean
this is probably why will colonize Mars

235
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:27,870
have a planet as ipv6

236
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:35,850
I mean this is the concept that nothing
has a border so it doesn't make a

237
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,379
difference if it's a total

238
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,250
you to rate them and that's the whole
idea of so many so many IP addresses

239
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,450
that will be able to connect so you know
those that got their head around there

240
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,270
is no borders there is no perimeter and
external so on and so forth and

241
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,790
networking will have a better time than
people who are still building walls as a

242
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,680
defense mechanism now this is good in
the medieval times and roms on it so

243
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,920
full it shitty the tech world which is
gonna build a wall and everything on the

244
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,370
outside this will have bad guy and
everything on the inside of this is a

245
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:13,050
good guys are middle of security so they
get their head around this time those

246
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:20,389
the dorm probably died at eighty support
market will be exploding soon and I'll

247
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,360
have to do firmware updates from a
fridge in the near future and I just see

248
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,189
how many ways that can go wrong I i do i
do firmware updates with my furnace

249
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:39,030
today i'm looking for the patch Tuesday
for your home but if you look at that so

250
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:46,490
throw away the borders ipv6 provide one
possibility to connect to all the things

251
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,630
we do with what we see today

252
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,380
embedded

253
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,680
software development perspective I would
say there's going to be a lot worse when

254
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,020
it comes to exploitable software and
hardware because they aren't ready

255
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:06,160
software I've seen is really really had
nothing changed right i mean we've been

256
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,830
talking about sanitation input for god
knows how long I mean it some point we

257
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:18,100
have to look as an industry say because
we've talked about this and we still

258
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,830
have like a skewer lie right we still
have this going on at some point guard

259
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,970
to look in the mirror and say maybe snow
the developers maybes as the conch

260
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,860
convey the message they're definitely
there is a problem here so you know just

261
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,010
moving the attack says is that gonna be
the same types I mean look look at what

262
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,100
we're about see what I see in all the
like a g6 ICMP with full weekend off

263
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,490
attacks and pink tones and so on and so
forth we didn't mitigate the problem we

264
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,300
turned it off

265
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:59,320
guess what defense mode processes in
ipv6 so guess what we just did so

266
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,929
everything old is new again let's sort
of process we've seen before where is it

267
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,360
so that's

268
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,990
go back to the good old days when we put
computers on the internet for the first

269
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,460
time and then we saw there was a problem
or less and then we put phones on the

270
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,890
internet and we got the same problems
and now we're trying to solve them and

271
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:25,309
now we're putting small tiny embedded
devices with Linux bad configured Linux

272
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:31,280
and where that September from all over
again and in cars and airplanes worried

273
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:42,970
about I'm slightly worried about to go
there is a time with an Internet

274
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,220
connection right there's a good with an
Internet connection

275
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:57,650
yeah right ok so wishes on a project at
any point in that brought me connect

276
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,010
this thing right it will be fucking
awesome if we can just buy issue

277
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,690
remotely at what point do you all agree
as a point where I like this assault

278
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:18,520
rifle but is it by financial status

279
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:32,450
security issues and MCC group published
attacks where they attack the debt

280
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:43,980
DAB radio and a technically cost
containment system so we're actually an

281
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,350
exception to attack surfaces we
intentionally putting their

282
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:59,340
unintentional except factors that's
that's pretty awesome we we we actually

283
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,720
have an episode on attack vectors really
old programs are you should we should

284
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,520
probably do you think there's there's
been a few more services since we've

285
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,350
reported that one actually i just i just
felt that parking cars is sort of

286
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:25,310
getting old tanks of retro hockey their
cars pretty cool right so like six

287
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:34,030
months so like August submarines right
that's that's good I'm going for tanks

288
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:41,250
next and I think it's a fun when we saw
terminator free 14 and you saw

289
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,380
Terminator 3

290
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:59,540
yeah no it doesn't feel so just look at
Star Trek that right

291
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,930
movie with the trucks

292
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:12,310
humans is a Transformers maximum drivers
and i think is delinking movies and yeah

293
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:19,750
yeah and I'm seeing that future I think
that was written during simpson's

294
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:26,860
cocaine years so anything else it would
be looking like 10 years to have a quick

295
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:34,490
question when we look at the the general
trends three recent years there has been

296
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:40,190
a shift towards from general computing
towards locking devices iPods and stuff

297
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,190
like that this investigation level of
how these devices are locked this

298
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,320
increasing all the time it gets more
difficult to bring their ages shapes and

299
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,980
everything so what do you think about
the future and that will be it will be

300
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:04,250
an I can be jailbroken and what are the
consequences of this from well

301
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,330
everything can get hacked but is he
saying it's been more and more difficult

302
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:14,129
to actually a break in an iDevice and
there are fewer and fewer expert

303
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:19,020
developers that have the competencies to
to be able to take some photos I don't

304
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,950
think we are busy and unhappy couple
device but perhaps it will be that hard

305
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:31,770
that there won't be any public waste to
jailbreak your device cost benefit right

306
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:40,150
yeah yeah nobody is interesting in let's
say nobody no civilian is

307
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,460
will be interested in paying that much
money to develop and exploit for this

308
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,510
race is used to have this kind of mantra
that the only safe computer was a

309
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:56,210
disconnect the computer Germany had this
is the minds of all the things and then

310
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,070
the fuck is that too

311
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,580
even now an unplugged device is not
necessarily take the soundcard oh right

312
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,480
that's that's where written actually
happened from there on in so I'm with

313
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,210
you on the pool

314
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:21,550
the only thing this on capitol is on how
you can fix anything in like 10 years

315
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:27,370
ago a gathering not only would be dead
but it would be readily available to

316
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:36,239
most people that can use Google
malicious firmware hard drives and the

317
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,250
malicious of a fee

318
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:44,760
bias it scares me it's likely you can't
you can't trust hardware to build you

319
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:54,800
can shoot yourself from transistors and
I think the most trust so implementation

320
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:05,330
yes the QSC qsee operating system for
trusts and

321
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:13,280
presentations on people actually
succeeding in making those and my

322
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:20,450
understanding is actually get through on
a Linux system and can't stop talking to

323
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:26,790
a trust issue commands to that the trust
rating system actually has less modern

324
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:32,970
security features than the Linux systems
have succeeded in attacking to getting

325
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:40,660
to the point that you can start
attacking the trust and to get back to

326
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,600
the question I think that the
development will see is that more

327
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,969
devices will get more efficient

328
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,720
tools to to sort of to make exploits
harder we will see the same development

329
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,620
with that we have seen me I devices we
will see those in Android as well and we

330
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,260
will see those in the embedded feel as
well so things will get better and

331
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,820
better but then we are so creative in
this world that we always create new

332
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,519
types of tools and those will not have
this fancy

333
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:17,299
features so they will in turn be
exploitable is dead so even if we did

334
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,969
the old stuff will be hard to hack there
was always be new gadget so we can

335
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:29,969
actually toasters bridges planes and and
on that note the tanks I think in

336
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:38,809
counter to that I think since the
consumer market is pushing for more and

337
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:43,349
more connected devices and more and more
gadgets and we're talking about wearable

338
00:32:43,349 --> 00:32:49,729
some things like that they the marketing
departments and the tech departments

339
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:55,409
will have a huge drive to to come out
with new features and those will be

340
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:02,190
those will be customer oriented features
not security features so I think you

341
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,919
know they're still gonna be so much so
much new technology coming in with the

342
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,929
same vulnerabilities we looked at ten
years ago that will be introduced and

343
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:17,079
and they will become the pivot point
that you and like you see that point is

344
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,379
the toaster that you can use to get a
foothold and then the security systems

345
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:27,059
because they will be connected via
Bluetooth or WiFi or whatever so we need

346
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:37,359
support yeah it's easy question I think
about is how do you see a reskin

347
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:47,089
possibilities in creating botnets in
Internet other things i've seen your

348
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,270
viewpoint

349
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,310
couple of papers already like two to
three years ago regarding Andrea

350
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:02,610
successful business creation from from
meshed III devices say I would say

351
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,000
they're great possibilities

352
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:16,889
things you have said Hi too likely right
yeah I would say very likely claimed at

353
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,520
dayton was produced from

354
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:30,929
rotors which is computed by computer
devices are being hacked at the BRIT

355
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:37,500
Awards game and they also said that they
find other malwares and some of the

356
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:46,080
router so I mean it's already happening
it's a short really scary too beautiful

357
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:54,549
to have questions from the people in the
audience don't be shy

358
00:34:54,550 --> 00:35:06,260
re still hungover from last night some
of us on the stage or so I've got a

359
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,470
question for us all

360
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:15,020
yesterday just a hero or villain
connected to the other discuss the

361
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,460
gesture hero or villain

362
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:24,510
let's go from left to right I'm not sure
but he's entertaining

363
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,550
he's entertaining at least I don't know
it's really tough to answer actually

364
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,910
because he's doing some good stuff and
some really weird stuff as well so it's

365
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:51,210
not like and why I'd say I'm gonna go
for villain and then go for like super

366
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,760
villain but is actually quite a
supervillain like Bond villain no more

367
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:08,400
like talk to you later I would say
prankster because my understanding yes

368
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:18,440
but very efficient looking out for when
sites will go down for explaining the

369
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,740
NSE's etcetera and has published handed
down a minute ago stone so it's very

370
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:35,359
clever guy creating PR stuff didn't do
quite a lot of things actually some of

371
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,848
this year's pranks where he took credit
for natural ornaments are sort of agree

372
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:48,020
with you peter i think is an internet
troll is an amusing interest role and

373
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,809
especially when he attacks the Westboro
Baptist Church the only really love him

374
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:59,849
yeah I can't can't agree more I would
say international so for me it's it's

375
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:05,349
interesting because how we determine if
he's a hero or a villain is the victims

376
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:10,640
of crime rates are deserving and those
that are not and you know so we're all

377
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,690
cool with the Baptist Church getting
because a bunch of assholes and then

378
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,539
we've got no sympathy but you know if we
if we look at other targets we can you

379
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,490
know if you change the target face we
certainly have different attachments to

380
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:33,578
meet you know judge jury and executioner
themselves and we're really back to

381
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:36,420
where we started with a morality

382
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:49,810
it depends as a bunch of people would be
far more black and white and also great

383
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:56,930
but it is to me it's always like an
example that chris Roberts so you know

384
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,980
chris Roberts possibly in Stuart Levey
explaining this way possibly intercepts

385
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,930
packets on a network someone who
arbitrarily execute code on someone

386
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:12,720
else's property which would we decide is
the worst in that that being framed that

387
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,029
way said the person execute code
arbitrarily definite on someone else's

388
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,550
property without their permission now
tell you that the people doubt having

389
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:27,730
that code executed on their property or
wifi pineapple pineapple users in this

390
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:33,870
kiddies and then all of a sudden people
like that so funny its lead is low so

391
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,170
the minute that we changed the face of
the victims who minute change the crime

392
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,460
it's really interesting to kind of look
at it in that context and and and you

393
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,940
know it kind of like that the hacking
back I mean is it ok to hop back that's

394
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:56,060
that's again they know who's who's on
the other side of that system if you're

395
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,140
throwing packets and we'd like to think
very good right

396
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:09,629
blaming you know but yeah I'd agree and
thank you could actually attacking the

397
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,710
police yes

398
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:20,800
and with that I think it's time for Iraq
yeah well it's been really great

399
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,140
standing here talking in front of you
all even though I am terribly hungover

400
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:31,920
hope you guys enjoyed it as much as we
did on stage I'm sure and just to let

401
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,380
you know we do have some t-shirts
appearance state so if you want them I

402
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,060
mean there's not too many less but run
up and grab one in a first come first

403
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:49,529
serve and anything else you guys who
said this yesterday but you guys have

404
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,980
been cool but a big round of applause
the sexy volunteers for doing such a

405
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,520
great job as well however long
