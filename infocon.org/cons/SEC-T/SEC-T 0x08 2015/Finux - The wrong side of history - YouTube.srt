1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
before four starters like two things
firstly it's it's kind of awesome to be

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,190
back it's fantastic conference and
secondly I think we should probably give

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,588
a big grounds for the volunteers and
sexy they do a fantastic job for one of

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:24,939
the best organized conferences so give a
round of applause and sexy people well

5
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:32,630
this is gonna be fun talk which is a bit
unusual for me but I've been now it's

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,570
kind of like a gnat politics ethics sort
of talk time talking about the

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,840
similarities between the Manhattan
Project

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,230
the global surveillance revelations that
are good friends noting gave to his

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,339
right so how many of you have heard of
the Manhattan Project hands up you have

10
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,010
no idea how many people I asked this
question too and they don't put their

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,260
hands up which is either they shy will
they have no idea about history kind of

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,369
worrying right so it's a shame talking
about the global surveillance that's as

13
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,670
the media likes to reported a good
friend

14
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,210
things are going to change he was right
so let's start off with a striking

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,339
similarity between the two projects
right surprise surprise there were both

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,100
top secret right here to see that coming

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,710
both became very public so if you don't
know who this guy is in this column the

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:41,970
dolls that way you looked only at the
wrong place and this guy klaus fruits so

19
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,619
to start off with the Manhattan Project
the global surveillance project both

20
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:52,420
suffered from whistleblowers right mouse
roots is a person in my country Britain

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:02:00,030
considers a traitor he gave the nuclear
secrets to the Soviet Union he was a

22
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:08,590
communist he served 14 years in a
British jail for treason and moved to

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,790
the GDR after I became a teacher
interesting enough much like snowden

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,579
didn't do it for the money but I kinda
want to talk about the how did the

25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,200
Manhattan Project start what kind of
made a kickoff and like all great

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,060
stories it starts with fear

27
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:35,260
ok so just before the beginning of World
War Two in berlin they managed to split

28
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,739
the awesome and anyone with a kind of
like a high school grade education in

29
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,760
physics realized very very quickly

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,579
oh my god they can build a bomb so what
happened at the beginning of World War

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,680
two is there a number of scientists from
Germany jewish scientists from journey

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,769
of a sea left and the two main places to
go

33
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:06,370
the UK and America and Einstein amongst
the few other people in america

34
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,700
and they write a letter to Roosevelt
basically making the case of why

35
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,060
American means to pursue a nuclear
option why they need to build a nuclear

36
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,310
weapon and basically is the good old
they've got a bomb they've got a bomb

37
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,359
they've got weapons of mass destruction
of weapons of mass destruction they

38
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,700
gonna drop on euro my god it's coming
back a bomb-maker bomb-maker bomb I've

39
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,738
got weapons of mass destruction we've
kind of heard this before wrote recently

40
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:40,920
you know to put it into context when I'm
sinuses big man is he was now row I mean

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,429
is it wasn't a small man by any stretch
of the imagination so we can imagine

42
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,650
what the Americans did straightaway
Roosevelt signed off on the Manhattan

43
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,950
Project

44
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,518
and probably one of the biggest
incidents one of the biggest projects in

45
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,709
history to shape mankind comes out of
this so this is an interesting story

46
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:11,709
this is a react to this is actually the
first reactor this is the interesting

47
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:20,769
bit these lunatics built it in Chicago
ok I do not advise you building a

48
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,100
nuclear reactor in your back garden ok
you're probably going to go to jail

49
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,020
unless you chicago university but they
built this nuclear reactor under a

50
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,180
sports field in chicago this reason we
don't build reactors in Maine

51
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,250
metropolitan areas they kind of didn't
know this was to say this is the first

52
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:45,320
nuclear at two so they have no actually
idea what they're really doing this is

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,500
kind of scene by their health and safety
laws were their health and safety

54
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,919
policies in place

55
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,799
buckets of water in case it goes
critical yeah good luck with that very

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,100
very cool and this was actually all
about funding Chicago kind of worried

57
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,539
that once the Manhattan Project start
there was five ways to enrich uranium

58
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,919
that they knew about they didn't know
which one would work so I decided to

59
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,000
give it a go with all of them

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Chicago was worried that it was going to
get out of the mix so it built the first

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,850
react to very very quickly this is just
great flight control rods you know you

62
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,360
could make the cell phone but as I say
don't know if you do tell me and I'll

63
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,980
send you a postcard were in prison so

64
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:40,770
the manhattan project resource intensive
projects said very least in wartime

65
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,270
America the bill was two billion dollars
that works out to be about twenty six

66
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,190
billion dollars in 2014

67
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,420
it's still pretty cheap actually if you
think about it and just enough the

68
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:03,130
manhattan project during the height of
War 2 10 percent of Americans

69
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,210
electricity output that's more than
Chicago and Boston put together

70
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,719
surprisingly no one noticed right it's
one of the huge building exercise so

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,110
they bring in a general general general
growth Leslie groves to start working on

72
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,320
the Manhattan projects in military
project with civilian civilian

73
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,170
consultants as they like to call them
prima donnas a kind of science for me to

74
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:39,070
write a building number sites it's
interesting to know if growth is famous

75
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:45,090
for building the pentagon that's his
claim to fame right you can kind of tell

76
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,340
historical something is when the
Pentagon building the pentagon is a

77
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:56,039
footnote in your bio it doesn't even
make the highlight reel right so he was

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,070
a little bit disappointed because like
old general's they want to go to war and

79
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,500
they've got a war and he gets to stay
home and build stuff prima donna

80
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,130
theoretical physicists who is a little
bit to say the very least a very famous

81
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:22,840
story about when he is trying to build
the physicists right what do you need

82
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,000
the physicist like we haven't thought
about it that's the problem with

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,020
theoretical physics you have to theorize
so

84
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,750
they started giving him rough estimates
of what they needed to build their off

85
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,599
by a factor of 10 which isn't very
scientific the best but it's certainly

86
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:47,229
not very military and drove goes to his
military oversized you know look at

87
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,530
whether these people I asked them to
something to give me something is off by

88
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,359
a factor of town as a bit like being
told that I have to prepare a wedding

89
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,229
4,000 people but maybe hundreds turn up
maybe ten thousand internal completely

90
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,789
impossible I can't do this and they
basically told him to go forth and

91
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:11,210
multiply you are doing it and so the
story begins

92
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,960
huge huge huge infrastructure huge
infrastructure five main sites 5

93
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,818
enrichment facilities in a
research-based this is just some of them

94
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:28,979
this building here is so if I'm jumping
a bit smaller damaged my career on these

95
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,849
buildings quite interest in the middle
of this is a gaseous diffusion plant

96
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:39,559
top-secret around 1983 no one can deny
which doesn't sound impressive and less

97
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,790
I'm sorry I may have the West European
history by the way I still do things in

98
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:54,990
miles rather meters but these legs these
legs are half a mile long oK so it's one

99
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,370
of the biggest military building at the
time

100
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:06,259
wouldn't suggest visiting it it slightly
radioactive

101
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,069
Los Alamos has an interesting story as
well los alamos so you look at the

102
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:15,849
military doctrine and dogma secrets is
we try and departmental lights

103
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:23,709
intelligence sources so they're a few if
you you know if you get an agent no one

104
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,029
knows the whole picture that's the whole
idea between like departmental ization

105
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,910
which is sort of the polar opposite of
what theoretical Sixers kinda need to

106
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:39,029
talk about so there was a big to anthro
between oppenheimer and drove about what

107
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:44,329
they were going to do and eventually
they settled on buying a an old-school

108
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,789
knocking it down and building a research
facility and what we're going to do is

109
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:53,309
that going to ship all the researchers
to this area I'm going to work in that

110
00:09:53,309 --> 00:10:00,549
big fence around it god's you know
that's cool interesting story doesn't

111
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:04,728
always benefit you and you notice
something a little bit strange to make

112
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:11,039
it to raise the alert example nearest
train station to Los Alamos Chicago

113
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:17,459
metropolitan train station and Los
Alamos is a very very small train

114
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,709
station the backwoods of nowhere that no
one ever goes to and what they would do

115
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,029
is they would go to Chicago cut you
trying to this place get picked up by

116
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,929
military jeep and off to Los Alamos and
you can imagine this train station close

117
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:36,039
manager of a train station in his
thirty-odd years of being there

118
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:42,299
soda ticket to this train station and
then all of a sudden day Pandey a number

119
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,519
of foreigners in wartime America not
only are buying tickets to train station

120
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,439
he's never soldier in his life but
they're buying one way tickets and like

121
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:55,180
a

122
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,329
like a good samaritan sticks his hand
arm says hey this is all a little bit

123
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,710
weird he was no longer the manager of
that particular train station problem

124
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:15,730
solved so yeah mannheim projects
interesting people really realized very

125
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,920
rarely realize that its hind the
manhattan project employed a hundred and

126
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,530
ten thousand people that's not a small
number about a thousand actually knew

127
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:34,220
what they were doing the plants involved
this is not all of them if you've got

128
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,080
this is just a few of them there

129
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:44,020
these are the mug shots they all got
them every single one of them

130
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,829
infrastructure in place is huge exam
these infusion plants you know they

131
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,560
would have two or three football fields
and teams in baseball teams and shops as

132
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,089
very strange for water production
because normally wore prime time

133
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:07,340
production goes wheel raw materials in
our product right when you're rich in

134
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:15,080
uranium you material and then you will
in raw material and then you will enroll

135
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,139
material and you see nothing so

136
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,559
when the project came this an
interesting story about people in jobs

137
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,238
and departmental ization right when the
bombs became public knowledge and they

138
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,429
ended up on

139
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:38,790
oppenheim and it offers time's man of
the year of this year by everybody had a

140
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,309
story about the Manhattan Project this
was a particularly interesting one of

141
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:48,079
the woman that worked in the laundry
military job during the war and her job

142
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,988
was to save this very weird looking
stick close that they were washing and

143
00:12:55,989 --> 00:13:03,720
if the stick went to get the general and
it turned out that she was first line

144
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,790
decontamination duty and it was a Geiger
counter and what she was doing so traces

145
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,919
of radiation and had no idea whatsoever
what she was doing right I mean how

146
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,249
would you have no context this raised
you know well just a bigger back that's

147
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:28,209
all it was so if we remember that I
started off saying the building a bomb

148
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,459
because of the Nazis were building a
bomb the custom fitted with building a

149
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:36,018
bomb the cost of building a bomb because
of his quick quick quick we're doing

150
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,169
this to save the world

151
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:49,759
1945 happens happens in 1945 well as
random and of course the Manhattan

152
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,379
Project hopped on the first available
plane and let's see what the Germans

153
00:13:54,379 --> 00:14:02,839
were up to and this is what the Germans
were up to this is a reactor that hasn't

154
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,189
been built this is just a hole in the
ground remember they have weapons of

155
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,760
mass destruction

156
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,800
this is a said vaguely familiar right
they've got weapons and we've got proof

157
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,079
that should prove talk a little bit
about the German project in a little

158
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,150
while it's kind of interesting but yet
nothing there at this point when you're

159
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,270
building a weapon for a particular enemy
is sort of preclusion to think well we

160
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,699
don't need the enemy we don't need a
weapon anymore and a bunch of

161
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,370
theoretical physicists never had the
idea they just went back to work and

162
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:48,090
kept on building where you know it's got
caught up in the science right you know

163
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,820
trying to find the solutions the
interesting thing in the end of the war

164
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:01,170
is that the USS all things are peaceful
in Europe air quotes but Japan and

165
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:12,050
America are still enemies let's talk
about the phenomenal story U-boat 234 if

166
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,920
this is probably the best evidence that
history has him means sense of irony of

167
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,719
ironies this is not an off by one hour
of anyone that knows the physics this is

168
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,440
not you know it really was called you to
34 rich uranium 235 to make uranium u

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,830
238 as well thats weapons grade this
boat is UT 34 and this is the last

170
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:45,450
biggest boat that the Germans have it is
not a very experienced crew on board

171
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:51,430
because everyone with experience is dead
they think so they're about to go and

172
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,620
make the last on the boat gets called
back to Germany they retrofitted and

173
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,860
they turn into a cargo boat

174
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,500
this is a very interesting story because
what happens is during the wall germany

175
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,450
and japan obviously hours right and
toward the end of the world that kind of

176
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,630
worked how the the enigma is not over
the top to be right they've worked out

177
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,360
that maybe the communications channels
slightly broken to Japan and Germany are

178
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,680
swapping communications via U-boat
literally giving someone a message and

179
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,689
sending it across Japan sent to add
minutes to ambassadors diplomats

180
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,480
whatever military personnel as well to
germany and their main goal is to

181
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,320
convince Hitler directly there

182
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:51,240
Germany's war is lost but Japan is the
one to carry the file and whatever

183
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,250
journey can do to help Japan it needs to
do it now because otherwise it's all

184
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,870
over

185
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:04,740
surprisingly agrees and this boat
becomes hitler's evil tragedies Rovers

186
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,660
shit in this boat there's a spy plane
this weapon designs there is also pretty

187
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,270
much all of Germany's you to 35
stockpile and their research into

188
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,760
nuclear physics so it wasn't enough to
make a bomb by any stretch of the

189
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,180
imagination but japan had no no kind of
research in this area and Natural

190
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,370
Resources uranium either so this was
kind of like a good start this is kinda

191
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,399
like a good starting block right so the
German sailors have a great story this

192
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,610
standing on the dock row and then
watching these Japanese guys come up

193
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,000
with these boxes and their writing you
to 35 on the side of the boxes the

194
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,860
German sailors let's look at these
idiots you 234 they had no idea what was

195
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,449
going on so anyway the ball goes off

196
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:07,419
and we the allies known there what's on
the boat but we're pretty sure that it's

197
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:13,529
important that something's going on so
we work out its Lena shipping lane and

198
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:18,789
we bombed the shit out of it right we
day and night day and night this boats

199
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,010
good for about three hundred meters they
have to bring it down to 900 to escape

200
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,029
that charges you know anything would
have brought this boat down at this

201
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,090
point

202
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,510
luckily enough they survive they raised
the they raised back up to get

203
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:40,370
communication after made the seventh off
before they come up a maidservant after

204
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,018
may not have received the transmission
that they've done a great job for their

205
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:48,860
country but their country is surrounded
the Allied Force and that they are to

206
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,719
fly a black flag on the communications
poll and surrendered the first Allied

207
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,500
fleet that they come across the skipper
of this boat with too daunting tasks he

208
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,909
could ignore the message and become a
pirate and a war criminal origins Aranda

209
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:15,679
so for some reason the German sailors
decide that the only people that want to

210
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,070
surrender to the americans have no idea
why but they've decided that the

211
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,379
americans they're the ones they want to
surrender to there's a slight problem

212
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:34,850
with that happens to be two Japanese
ambassadors in their boat who are at war

213
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,678
with America and these two Japanese
people

214
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,570
ambassadors soldiers and so on and so
forth certainly went on a boat full of

215
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:51,850
allies and with one radio transmission
later on a boat full of enemies and they

216
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:58,029
have their sidearms relinquished and
they were put into their rooms ready to

217
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,860
be given to the Americans when they
surrounded

218
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,040
we can all imagine the story which
happens here

219
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,159
Japanese take their life's sleeping
pills and the Americans carry out their

220
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,580
germs carry on as though nothing's
happened there is interesting is a

221
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,909
Canadian Boat slightly closer than the
American boat and its John skipper gives

222
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,920
disinformation to the Canadiens in the
right information see americans so he's

223
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,880
he's fucking with one of them right gets
the other one in and they surrendered to

224
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,740
the surrendered to the americans and
basically oppenheimer's right-hand man

225
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:42,720
turns up when this boat pulls into the
you s Harbor they they find the Iranian

226
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,140
234 235 they throw that into their
stockpiles they enrich it and it makes

227
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,480
part of the weapon they dropped on
Hiroshima so when I say to her she's got

228
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,419
a cool sense of irony it's quite shrewd
right the Japanese gather uranium it was

229
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:06,650
just enriched in delivered by the
Americans its

230
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,350
it's not enough to make a bomb right but
it's it's a good day in the office of

231
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,000
society will contribution a lot more
americans have to do and it's not that

232
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,530
the american specifically say this is
what we're going to do they literally

233
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,889
just throw in the pile the rest of
uranium is literally all they do they

234
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,400
don't give it any credence its knowledge
no important story about it but it's a

235
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,660
fascinating story you some documentaries
that you can find on this huge something

236
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,660
like this it's remarkable rate very very
undocumented kind of party so some of

237
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:50,850
the weapons this is little boy but this
is this is a trigger mechanisms two ways

238
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,419
that you can blow nuclear materials of
you can use kinda like a barrel and

239
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,970
piston approach which is literally like
gone so you ought to fission materials

240
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:06,800
ago critical didn't even bother testing
this design the new it would work

241
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,850
ok now I know this is fat man and this
is an employee-owned devices is very

242
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,730
very hard for them to work out how to do
enough it's brits that helped the

243
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,830
Americans work out how to do implosion
and this comes from normandy

244
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,879
surprisingly shaped charges so what you
want to do is you want to have an

245
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,590
implosion device you want to bring down
the material uniformly small as you can

246
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,169
for critical however making things
explode is very easy making things

247
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,870
implode is not so easy

248
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,979
sends out shaped charges which were
predominantly used in by the ritz and

249
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,520
its British personnel to help Americans
do this

250
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,610
this is the gadget so you know when you
see videos

251
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:04,240
Manhattan Project to see that famous
scene that's this this magic sweets

252
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,240
signs that leaves seemed interesting
story about scientist overthinking

253
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,470
problems so that will the gadget out
into the desert Alamogordo Trinity

254
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:23,100
Trinity site Alamogordo New Mexico means
this is the Death Valley if you get

255
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,600
caught on this valley without any water
you're dead man walking basic

256
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,250
they they they use this is a test site
and the gadget the implosion device they

257
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,240
put it up on top of a rig baseband it's
been ages constructing and testing them

258
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,950
together and of course they don't have
the call with them because that stupid

259
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,310
eventually decides that they're going to
set the weapon off they put the

260
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:57,310
plutonium into a military vehicle drive
really really fast scary physicist

261
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,800
half-centuries cause the military driver
had no fucking idea whatsoever they get

262
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,680
to the gadget to get the plutonium claw
and dunk it doesn't fit six years of

263
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:16,360
engineering groups we've kind of fucked
up oppenheimer apparently loses his shit

264
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,879
he's been a very very cool calm
collective character throughout this and

265
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,040
apparently you can probably just dropped
him on Japan at this point

266
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,490
unfortunately some people remembered
their high school science and when we've

267
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,830
had this out in the deaths of four days
and its contracted and expanded with the

268
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,550
heat believe the plutonium cause
condensation ambient temperature it will

269
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,280
fit in right now for six hours later
studies about problems

270
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,440
ok but yeah you can imagine just just
for a little while

271
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:02,990
mother nature had a good little trolling
exercise on these scientists so this

272
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,690
this moment happened very famous moment
history

273
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:15,550
watch the video of the explosion is one
person that is totally on their game

274
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:20,430
that day so this is like the most
nerve-wracking moment for these

275
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:26,110
physicist this is six years of work with
the american military breathing down

276
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:35,100
then that this is this is their moment
so they video recorded right not live

277
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,540
stream like us but you know the video
recorded and the weapon goes the

278
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,030
director of the video sees it and
straightaway doesn't give a shit about

279
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,960
science right straight Lagos that's
going to be out shocked and quickly

280
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,740
pounced the camera up if you watch the
video it was never supposed to jump up

281
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,000
jump up and this is the director he had
done that we wouldn't see the mushroom

282
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,909
cloud that's a long long story short
this

283
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:12,599
they had no idea how powerful this is
going to be an example is when you have

284
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:17,269
a colleague pregnant in an office and
people take like a sweepstake back on

285
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:24,139
how big the baby's going to be this is
exactly what these guys gonna be 18

286
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:29,320
megatons I'm gonna take forty megatons
I'm gonna take 400 megatons right no

287
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,249
idea whatsoever at all is an interesting
story because there's a researcher at

288
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:43,919
metallic later on he totally is the
harbinger of death so he manages to

289
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,869
scare the whole entire project because
what he says is hey we're going to

290
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:52,970
ignite the atmosphere you don't need to
be a scientist to realize that that just

291
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:01,879
doesn't sound very good right so general
grows gets this information from Gaza

292
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:08,049
that the trip that the gadget is gonna
burn the world and he's somewhat like

293
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:14,109
hey this is not remember was talking
about this point any storms and

294
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:20,330
oppenheimer's office like hey what's the
story and Oppenheimer said so look at

295
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,449
the numbers wrong we've recounts them
and it's a one in three million chance

296
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:32,669
rank and of course the military guy
here's one in one in 10 of what you mean

297
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:40,700
there is a possibility it's one in three
million so there is a possibility right

298
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,570
foot during the day so they bring in the
researchers to see their magic right and

299
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:50,960
this is very good and they have no idea
how big this thing is going to be a two

300
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,440
hundred miles away they they give
welders masks and they tell them what

301
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,509
you want to do is put your feet towards
the explosion lie on your belly and put

302
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:05,549
the welder's mask in front of you

303
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,519
bearing in mind that even though it's
gonna be four hundred megatons which two

304
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,130
hundred miles away on your belly wasn't
gonna help you right

305
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:19,780
this happens is handing people sunscreen
from 200 miles away

306
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:27,840
just a great so that's what I call
trolling so happens and then probably

307
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,010
one of the most famous quotes gonna read
it

308
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:39,600
sure you guys can read but he's right
this moment happens we have nothing in

309
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,080
his shoes comparable road I mean how do
you how do you explain things in

310
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,110
explosions I mean it's just a bigger
bang great that's all you're here this

311
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:56,060
point this is like you know 18 tons of
TNT but there's no real contacts until

312
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:07,770
this moment so the moment that the
nuclear arms race begins as I said japan

313
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:14,240
is still at war with America and we can
certainly see where these weapons are

314
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,260
going to go so the Air Force guys right
there really good the drop people off of

315
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:29,760
walls and stuff like this and this guy
here one of the most famous planes in

316
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,200
history they spend a long time
practicing dry runs a drop in big

317
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,910
weapons and gang the hell out of town
because surprisingly just like we have

318
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,690
no experience of building nukes we have
no experience of delivering them you

319
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,970
certainly can't end up with a horse and
carriage you need to kind of get some

320
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,290
experience and he knows that this is
going to be a very very famous plane and

321
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,230
he calls after his mother again he knows
that is not gonna be another plane now

322
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,290
let's just for a moment that history
record the

323
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:08,399
it was gauged the drop the bomb so
people when they talk about the the the

324
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,980
government likes to talk about why
didn't he use official channels this is

325
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,490
an official channel I know it's very
small you can look this up later on this

326
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:27,690
is a petition that basically says you
cannot dropped on Japan without at least

327
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,370
letting them give them a warning right
like germany was fair game

328
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:39,090
ok but japan doesn't have an idea this
is Chicago remember those crazy

329
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,120
motherfuckers that built a react to it
Chicago little bit concerned about their

330
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,780
sights at this point this is the one
that lasts all at los alamos gets

331
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,440
halfway through until oppenheimer
himself stops oppenheim stops the stops

332
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:05,120
this subsys petition and it debate
happens with the they take drugs sort of

333
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,570
says okay look how about we offer you a
scientist's a panel to sit down with the

334
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,950
us- government with their with the
bombing at the bombing Commission and

335
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,910
you can make your case and he was
thinking that you know like most

336
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,380
scientist if you give him a job will get
bored with it eventually will ignore but

337
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,150
that didn't happen and Oppenheimer makes
an argument for pro bombing japan

338
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:33,100
without warning and what he says is look
the signs are still sketchy and if we

339
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,189
tell them hey we're going to drop a bomb
on you unless you surrender and we drop

340
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,930
a bomb and it doesn't go off that's
probably going to extend the world

341
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,860
because they're gonna think we're a
bunch of idiots and yes we have a live

342
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:51,330
demonstration they're going to think
that we're we we've trick them somehow

343
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,570
right given them a demonstration isn't
going to help we need to drop them

344
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:07,000
and they make not often higher but dies
takes over during war and then truman

345
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,570
makes somewhat of an argument that it
would be a war crime not to drop the

346
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:18,908
nuclear weapon that he would be he would
be a criminal to the american people by

347
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:26,029
not this is where this contacts the
dropping the nukes took two years of the

348
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:29,230
war and saved a hundred thousand
american lives there's actually nothing

349
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:35,100
to back that up this is just rhetoric
they've they've cooked the books along

350
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:41,980
the way the bombing commission for the
weapons were as they never gave truman

351
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,740
the whole story right up until Roosevelt
Roosevelt was alive

352
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,019
knew nothing about the project is that
secret the vice president of America at

353
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,000
the time and they had to brief him in
later

354
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,730
advisors to truman ahead of the game
roosevelt's advises so they knew what

355
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,610
they were doing was 12 sites target if
you ever hear that this was used to

356
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:15,529
target military targets ok that's a
pirate ship stinking pilot une to see

357
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,309
where the weapons were dropped

358
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,480
none of the weapons were dropped on a
military target all of them were dropped

359
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,350
in the middle of civilian targets so the
Japanese every city was getting

360
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,879
bombarded pretty much apart from 12
cities

361
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:36,990
the reason being is that the Americans
needed a city so that they could gauge

362
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,529
the impact of the weapon so you can
imagine thanking the Lord has blessed

363
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:47,789
you because we're not being firebombed
by napalm every day just to find out

364
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:50,629
that you probably gonna get dropped

365
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,670
and if you look at the sites of whether
drop these weapons there is military

366
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:01,700
infrastructure but it's all the weapons
drop specifically on city centers so

367
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,409
that they can gauge the impact quite
horrific these are obviously some famous

368
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:14,399
pictures like say hey why don't we kinda
build a plane out the black box material

369
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,310
if it's that good indestructible which
total building houses out these arches

370
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:26,940
unhealthy amount I'm looking at nuclear
devastation those things seem to stand

371
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,070
up a lot right so this happens the
harrowing moment the world really does

372
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:38,990
change only one nation has ever dropped
a nuclear weapon on another only one no

373
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,819
one else is new

374
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,190
anyone else this whole time and this has
stood the test of time

375
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:54,500
this is sweet science of playwright they
were trying to win a war but these

376
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:01,520
people paid the price for so startling

377
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,300
let's talk about russian intelligence
the Americans presumed that they had 10

378
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:13,620
use on the nuclear weapons is it took
that sticks with all of america's

379
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:20,430
resources and Russia / 22 million people
during world war two and was damn near

380
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:26,890
bankrupt so that resumption world's hey
it's gonna take from 10 years to get

381
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:33,210
anywhere close because they don't have
the weapons for years later big job they

382
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,680
drop a weapon a test this is not
anything other than a Russian

383
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,850
intelligence win this is not russian
scientists this is russian intelligence

384
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:53,259
win their KGB control their the pre
glucose the KGB had completely and

385
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,720
utterly penetrate the Manhattan Project

386
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:04,109
earlier on he was he was a communist
German Jew that moved to the UK 6 island

387
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:10,720
became part of our weapons our the
British nuclear weapon project Churchill

388
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,470
and Roosevelt made deal Americans
absorbed our project for the russians

389
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:23,259
have a nasa inside the British nuclear
and they lost contact with him and it

390
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,840
was slightly worried that he'd been
captured and then there were also kind

391
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,130
of worried because they have no kind of
visibility inside the manhattan project

392
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:40,770
and then surprise surprise the British
intelligence casa popped up inside the

393
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,800
manhattan project we flew Russia's
intelligence agents right into the

394
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,790
center of the plan

395
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:53,880
so you know it's pretty difficult
building bombs pretty difficult little

396
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,080
bit easier when you've got the ponds the
other issue that you might discover is

397
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,750
that russia is not particularly famous
for bombers also famous for bombings of

398
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,630
the time which is a bit of a worry
because as I said you can't turn up with

399
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,360
your with your nuclear weapon on a
donkey and a carriage rate you you need

400
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:20,060
to drop off and get the hell out of town
so they didn't have any bombers capable

401
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,870
of doing this but communism versus
capitalism styling has a great idea he

402
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:31,109
realizes the boeing is building its
flying fortress in mexico using

403
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,150
third-party contractors

404
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:39,380
cheap labor what he does is he sends an
agent with basically is full of cash

405
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:46,110
suitcase full of cash to the factory
manager and buys the puns and comes back

406
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:53,260
to Russia and the triple off is a exact
copy of the Flying Fortress you know

407
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,690
some people in history they got to say
weird and wonderful shit and get away

408
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,010
with it this is a story of this to
reverse engineer gets the plans for the

409
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,550
Flying Fortress 2 starring about it and
he says look the same design flaws

410
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:13,190
inherent design flaws within this plan
if we do this this in this we can make

411
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:21,290
it more efficient and says I want an
exact copy of that plane and the

412
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,259
engineer without thinking about it says
well join us to pick the stars on it too

413
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:31,670
and Starling obviously doesn't hear it
and walks off and the maggots talk about

414
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,600
this story for the rest of his natural
life which would have been a lot lot lot

415
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:42,020
shorter stalin that she heard that so
this is the American one this is the

416
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,860
Russian one failed at looking at two
pitches you wouldn't be able to tell the

417
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,240
difference

418
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,580
apart from

419
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:56,090
so as I said a whistleblower ideological
hour or an ideological traitor on

420
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:06,430
ideological you know it isn't about
money as i stage my government sees as a

421
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:16,240
traitor this Soviet Union saw him as a
hero and he gave his main goal with

422
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:25,040
giving the Soviet Union the plan was
that if America had not only the world

423
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:33,930
would not be you know communism needed
it so he's one of the little non told

424
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:39,359
stories about Thurs after American new
Japan it was like hey we've kind of the

425
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,020
big kids on the block and we're gonna
kick every allied out of this this is

426
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,360
our discovery no one is involved in this
now this is ours so we got kicked out

427
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,820
the relationship right so we helped
reduce some of the science and then all

428
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,210
of a sudden we got thrown back and we
have to deal with the russians and we're

429
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,790
on a wrong and the Americans got the
news they don't care about us anymore so

430
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:09,950
start stealing intelligence as a set for
the russians but his cover story was

431
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:17,210
stealing intelligence files so the same
time he basically gave two countries as

432
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:24,010
they rushed to the soviet union and he
goes to jail forty years later on legacy

433
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:29,950
when he gets released these refrig is
Patriots GDR becomes a teacher

434
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:38,069
you know he gives you get some plans
weighs literally like a couple of plans

435
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,570
interesting story the plutonium so he
finds a handler at he finds his Russian

436
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,020
handler in London

437
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:52,320
handsome plans for what was the the fat
man basically any hands of material

438
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,900
Russian Honda has no fucking idea what's
going on but he takes her straps

439
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,800
material in the test tubes the side of
his chest wrapped in a bandage hopped on

440
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,900
a plane in files into russia wants
material off and for the rest of his

441
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,119
life has radiation burns on the side of
his chest and it wasn't until much much

442
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,550
much much later they understood why that
happened if we look in comparison to

443
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:28,630
some propaganda from my government but
what they believe are much more in day

444
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:33,690
two terms but I think probably in
historical terms far less consequential

445
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:41,589
because the nuclear plans gave us the
beginning of the Cold War spy long time

446
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:45,759
trying to understand that if I was given
a decision about dropping weapons what

447
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,950
would I do and remember the hindsight
you can think about all of this stuff

448
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,279
until the cows come home but you don't
understand the context of what dropping

449
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:02,619
weapon another country would be very
very legitimate arguments this is that F

450
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:08,240
Japan had not been the guinea pig for
the next war that we would have had

451
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,649
would have been hot rather than cold but
this instant those methods

452
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:19,700
produced the cold war which shapes a
life for a long time to come

453
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,740
not a good day at the office

454
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,868
this is where how does the ideas hack
ago talking about the Manhattan projects

455
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:30,700
and intelligence and so on and so forth

456
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:37,919
I read a blog post about a year and a
half ago about how shocking news new

457
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,500
communism in in in mccarthyism right you
want to silence someone accused him of

458
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:51,930
being a haka they are a national
security threat get more scoring right

459
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:58,910
you know don't forget your judicial
process you know mccarthyism is defined

460
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:05,460
by using the judicial process as a as a
as a as a as a punishment and been

461
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:12,720
accused of Oaxaca in a lot of ways your
criminal judicial process is a

462
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,250
punishment in its own right

463
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:21,789
just us kevin Mitnick so I got just what
I was talking about the layouts wards

464
00:43:21,789 --> 00:43:29,160
and sorry to the great powers world's
biggest crime was checking out too many

465
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,730
books from the library right accused of
being accused of being a hat having his

466
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:39,670
lifetime around this is oppenheimer
time's man of the year it's amazing

467
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,690
right should give him a Nobel Peace
Prize pretty much what you do to people

468
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,369
that killed people right

469
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:51,390
I mean we left it was a runner-up in
1936 Nobel Peace Prize so you know the

470
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:59,960
kind of the writing was on the wall
right he really is the harbinger of that

471
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,630
because if you think atomic weapons
about let's talk about thermonuclear

472
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:11,420
weapons and that's his baby so
oppenheimer was dead against nuclear

473
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,170
weapons because really a new is enough

474
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:24,960
atomic weapon is it's not a small thing
right i mean it's not a paper cut

475
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,619
nuclear weapon uses an atomic weapon to
get it going

476
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:36,509
that's where it gets its energy to do
the next be so kind of gives you a rough

477
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:44,319
idea but thousand times bigger and the
US military want to pursue the

478
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,739
thermonuclear weapon right and Oppenheim
saying okay look it may be sweet science

479
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:54,269
but this is stupid because the russians
have a new because we have a new and if

480
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:58,339
you build a thermonuclear weapon they
will have a thermonuclear weapon and a

481
00:44:58,339 --> 00:45:03,710
problem with these weapons are is there
no strategic value whatsoever at all the

482
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:08,269
only thing that you can hit with a
thermonuclear weapon is us all moscow

483
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:12,450
you can't do anything else with the
thermonuclear weapon because there won't

484
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:17,009
be anything else they vaporized an
island with a thermonuclear weapon just

485
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:22,930
give you a rough idea vaporized where
they test the first thermonuclear weapon

486
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,509
doesn't exist anymore that's how
powerful they are so oppenheimer's

487
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:32,769
against him and of course oppenheimer is
the most famous nuclear man in the world

488
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:39,769
so if he says no is kind of hard to say
no oppenheimer we say yes so they

489
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,810
destroy his character basically

490
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:50,340
and pretty much on his testimony they
destroy his character and they basically

491
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:56,380
say he's really a communist and he's not
fit to hold all of the US secrets of a

492
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,630
problem because he was caught up all the
secrets so I'm not sure we've taken your

493
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:08,870
clearance away but we can't live you
memory right so 34 bucks are about this

494
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:14,740
is a thermonuclear weapon they're a
little bit smaller more efficient and

495
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:23,040
they are game changes they are horrible
and the arms race begins a new cycle of

496
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,230
war begins and everything they said they
were doing everything they said they

497
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:35,510
weren't gonna do they totally are doing
another kind of narrative keeps on

498
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:40,030
getting played out throughout history
and the next situation inside the wall

499
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:47,000
we all hear these soldiers in front of
computers thats what cyber war Israel if

500
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,650
you've got drinks you need to drink them
now believe that's the rule an

501
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:58,520
interesting side note have you noticed
the drone pilots wear flight suits

502
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,420
the one thing they're not doing is
flying it's a drone flights who's

503
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:11,650
apparently military has wear uniforms so
the arms race the russians Avenue

504
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,520
because the americans have a new
russians have a thermonuclear weapon to

505
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:22,310
see americans have a firm on the
americans have ICM bees to see america

506
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,740
because the only because the russians of
ICM booze and so on and so forth

507
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:32,950
let me get to the digital age that our
round we're there to defend this is just

508
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:40,939
one example of the sidebar arms raised
right after the revelations come out

509
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:48,050
about the 20 days from the government's
zero days from the US government the BND

510
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:52,790
not saying they were founded by Nazi
Party's but just know your history BND

511
00:47:52,790 --> 00:48:01,330
go back to the 12 stark and ask for 300
million extra funding to compete with

512
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:07,090
america's purchasing program probably
need another 0 on the end to be fair I'm

513
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,750
sure there is more government more
intelligence agencies requesting extra

514
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:15,720
funding from governments but this is
just the one that made the paper and I

515
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:22,859
live in Germany so it's a nice narrative
but yet we already started to see that

516
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:33,590
tit-for-tat process of what's happening
so Snowden's asked about this this what

517
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:39,140
what is this this is and I agree with
him stick my hands up to and say I agree

518
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:47,210
with him that a scientist's computer
sciences security scientist's we are

519
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,540
following the footsteps of arms that we
are the theoretical physicists of the

520
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:01,640
modern age our research is being used
right people will use your research

521
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:09,080
research is the stuff that you do

522
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:14,529
application and it doesn't necessarily
mean the you get to choose what happens

523
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:21,540
with do not forget that matter data
kills looking looking at history

524
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,830
metadata is not save you know this is
just another example if you don't think

525
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,790
today's DEALS then there's two Apache
helicopters that flew to Pakistan for no

526
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,190
reason right now just imagine if the
russians free to attack helicopters in

527
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:43,410
Berlin on metadata that's exactly what
happened in Pakistan so it's important

528
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,140
for us to remember that there is a
consequence for the research that we do

529
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:51,379
and I'm not saying don't do security
research but it's not just about

530
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,670
partying in the desert anymore not just
about drinking and going to after

531
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,790
parties and so on and so forth

532
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:05,550
real world applications going on now
we've already had our Trinity moments

533
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:13,619
when we pwned the entire cell network
world just because we still some say no

534
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:18,290
we took integrity away from you if you
looking for the narrative you will find

535
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:24,279
it you will find examples of security
research not being not being the good

536
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:30,140
guys on the block and let's talk about
an American agency protecting American

537
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,440
interests right not quite you know
commercial war going on right they

538
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,040
ponder on companies

539
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,910
example I'm sorry that this is so small
but this is the best I can do so in

540
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:50,310
nineteen thought in 2014 the Americans
spend fifty two point six billion

541
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:58,410
dollars on intelligence eighty percent
of that works its way through

542
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:03,720
third-party contractors guess what
people that that means security

543
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,819
companies right

544
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:08,000
HP also do some research

545
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,680
2014 the global spending on defense on
security computer defense was around

546
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:25,060
forty billion the americans out spent
more on offense and defense we've got

547
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:31,520
our priorities wrong at some point you
could put money that I was gonna talk

548
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,920
about the military-industrial complex
way of saying look a bit like a liberal

549
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:44,339
burmeister right but this is the problem
these people are not going to find peace

550
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:49,680
there is a number of weapons
manufacturers advising the government's

551
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,038
about the safety of the world what point
are they going to turn around and say

552
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:02,440
see that fifty billion dollars it's all
safe you can go and spend on food and

553
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,599
hospitals and education don't worry we
bombed everyone that was dangerous and

554
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,180
the world's a good place like polar
bears voting for higher carbon emissions

555
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:28,089
how many of you have read 1984 read it
again today because this +1 right words

556
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:34,910
peace this is exactly where do you think
we're ever going to see an end in a look

557
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,950
at the old propaganda swap communism for
terrorism and everything that sold will

558
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:46,319
be shining again this is where the worst
piece some of the main oxygen on stories

559
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,499
today general alexander this is lying to
his bosses and this is him lying to

560
00:52:53,499 --> 00:53:04,808
hawkers manned up on stage and light to
congressional oversight and light if you

561
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:10,619
guys if you guys lied under oath to your
government what would you expect to

562
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:15,200
happen to you would you expect to be
paid eight million dollars a year right

563
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,058
so they go this is general Grove I would
like to have some like evil general

564
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:28,079
story about him but he's he's basically
a cowboy road if it wasn't for him

565
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,140
oppenheimer wouldn't got the job

566
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,480
cosines it that people talk about the
good old days with intelligence

567
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:42,070
oppenheimer experienced state
surveillance from around 1933 onwards

568
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:49,140
when they reviewed his refused these
files to pull his security clearance

569
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:56,100
they will in a big trolley and the
investigation team goes she's crisis

570
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,330
gonna take his age hers another floor
outside

571
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:05,630
5 charlie's of intelligence on this guy
when they did his when they did his

572
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,230
security clearance the general when they
reviewed his security clearance and to

573
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,120
get away from him

574
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:16,779
general Grove actually stuck up from he
was in the defense to and said if you

575
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,810
ask me again we're given the security
intelligence got a little bit of an ego

576
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:26,190
but he's a great man for helping us to
find our country we should listen to but

577
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,770
they ignored him right

578
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:34,990
oppenheimer known grover in the case of
Aaron Swartz in Hocking other people use

579
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:40,470
our research I keep on saying this but
when it boils down to it you know it's

580
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:45,509
going to be a part where 2+2 is illegal

581
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:50,860
knowing something is a crime when I had
the benefit

582
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:56,860
like many years you with the internet
that I could go and go and learn

583
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:02,000
anything that I wanted I wanted to know
about something I could go onto the

584
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,420
internet ask inland and find out how
many of you have changed the way that

585
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:13,600
you use search engines today because
you're being watched because of the

586
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,490
change in that

587
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:21,549
behavior changes because of monitoring
people's behavior changes are children

588
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:27,080
growing up in a world where they want to
learn about al-qaida they could if they

589
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,950
wanted to know what it was all about the
only rupert murdoch you tell them

590
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:37,069
because if not the terrorist threats
were some of the advanced search

591
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:43,340
requirements for ending up on lists was
Linux and PDP right that's all of you if

592
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,080
you're not on the list you totally doing
something wrong as well rate so don't

593
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,860
feel too bad for yourself I feel like a
lot of what we see is if you've ever

594
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,290
watched brave new world summary we often
net neutrality but take away all the

595
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:04,660
media outlets like Netflix but you can't
have independent media on the second

596
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,270
hand internet that you can't reach any
motorists to slow you know just how the

597
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,530
PlayStation Network off if you want some
problems I'm back on if you want people

598
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:21,330
to be quiet and I we share some history
with a physicist cousins maybe we should

599
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:26,160
concentrate on that as well I'm not
saying don't do scientific research but

600
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,399
you know something in 20 years time you
gonna be the guy that wrote but it will

601
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,280
have the person who wrote better
intercept software or better encryption

602
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,580
software that's the choice that you've
got today are you going to help make

603
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,740
weapons are you going to help make
defense and I'll leave you with this I

604
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,350
will read this one does it make you
believe in absurdities can make you

605
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,569
commit atrocities I think this is a
model of a modern day

606
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:59,370
now is all from me I hope you enjoyed it
and I hope you enjoy the rest of your

607
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:10,788
conference thank you

608
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:21,269
morning talk now go on break stuff

609
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:34,508
judge you probably have maybe someone
has a question we have microphones that

610
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:38,469
will walk around in the audience the
only thing that I you know that I think

611
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:44,769
about is is a history always repeats
itself then there's nothing we really

612
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:50,288
could do about it so the russians have a
say that is if you keep one eye on the

613
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:54,489
past and one eye on the future blind in
one eye if you keep both eyes on the

614
00:57:54,489 --> 00:57:56,029
past your blind

615
00:57:56,029 --> 00:58:00,929
thousand future you blind in both and I
think this is the case that if you are

616
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:04,829
if you don't learn from history are
destined to repeat it right

617
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:11,249
these things happen time and time again
we obviously don't learn from it I think

618
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:15,328
when it comes to government you're
absolutely right you know we have to say

619
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:23,459
me to those revolutionaries become
government soon enough my great so many

620
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:28,740
questions from the audience for Phoenix

621
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:35,509
passing but how do you view the idea
that the bomb hadn't been dropped in 45

622
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,880
that it's a more sophisticated and
bigger bomb would have been dropped in

623
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:47,640
subsequent conflicts so it's just the
race for a bigger bang right thing is if

624
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,920
you've got something you're going to use
it I can only imagine this because I

625
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:59,119
mean look at the fact that they dropped
a nuke on Japan country with no they

626
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:06,040
they confiscated the beginning project
in the ocean and they dropped so if they

627
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,160
hadn't done in Japan imagine what they
would have done if the Soviet Union had

628
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,830
a new i mean just look at cuba right you
know the whole issue in cuba is a

629
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:23,110
beautiful example the russians move the
soviet union moves weapons to cuba right

630
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:28,080
but yet when the Americans have weapons
and Turkey and this is a stock that

631
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:33,730
narrative that is in talks about cuba is
exactly the same thing that's all so I

632
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:43,100
kinda feel ya you know if this example
this proxy example 2.2 like this is what

633
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:54,130
you could win I think we would have lost
either america or russia certainly got

634
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:54,590
smaller
