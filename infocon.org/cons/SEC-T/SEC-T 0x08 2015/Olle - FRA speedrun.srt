1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
I guess you guys want to see it so what
I try what I'd like to attempt to do is

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,099
a speedrun of a challenge so I picked
this challenge that you can look at on

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,839
the internet if you like there's a lot
of them like older ones that part of a

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,170
recruitment campaign but I picked this
one so i'm going to try now to to solve

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,380
this challenge and hopefully try to tell
you what I'm doing as well so let's go

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,250
so first we make this a bit shorter

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,809
there we go so we've got to read me

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,110
let's read me say read me basically says
I read this before

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,070
it says dr. evil has a password

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,100
archive inside a load of zip files and
he's got all the passwords it's your job

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,180
to find them first password is in clear
text and then there's a mysterious share

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,500
so well since they say the first one is
in clear text let's just try that looks

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
like an md5 hash

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
let's just try the readme file as the
word list

15
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,130
Oh Shh did I do something wrong yes I
didn't specify actually the hash so

16
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,130
sorry

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,530
only five sorry I'm a bit rusty here is
nervous as well there we go so that

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,760
should be the password for the first one
so

19
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,360
i'm going to type stage a lot of times
when I'm provoked supposed to be typing

20
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,350
stag so you'll have to excuse me for
that so that looks like a really big

21
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,539
file that's being unpacked let's just
have a look at what's in there

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
still unpacking

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,740
maybe

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,280
try this first okay so it looks like an
NTFS file system and

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,810
it's probably worth finding out what's
in there so I'm going to prepare man

26
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,810
come on

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,620
and also a while I'm waiting for this
turn back the readme said that along the

28
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,510
way we're not only looking for the
password to the next zip file we're also

29
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,720
looking for pieces of the pass phrase
that's used to unlock the password vault

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,240
at the end of the challenge

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,240
this is taking some time

32
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:07,260
yeah so we can deduce that this is going
to be mostly repetitive data because the

33
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,429
zip file i downloaded it was about 70 or
80 magazine now it's up to

34
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,640
yeah with eight gigs of image here so
there's not gonna be much in here have a

35
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,238
look

36
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,239
copy all the files over so now we have a
PDF and we have the next stage stage

37
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,140
three

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,640
there we go so let's have a look at that

39
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,269
I'll go away let's have a look at PDF

40
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,108
yep looks like PDF alright nothing weird
before the Heather so let's have a look

41
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:47,819
at the end there's something weird and
this looks like a hex encoded string so

42
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,819
I'm just gonna

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,580
so string is there we go

44
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,799
the fire this is going really slow I'm
sorry

45
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:24,070
let's see we've got our oh that's a
base64 blob take that because that

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,690
oh interesting so

47
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:41,409
this looks very much like rotated cipher
we could probably guess that this is

48
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:53,830
like an i or an a you can see the word
separators so let's try hate this thing

49
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,370
now let's roam around

50
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:13,460
oh there we go yep so that should be the
password for the first the third step so

51
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,739
let's see i have that

52
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,680
alright always do that before because
they've been sneaky so it's actually

53
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:38,710
just a 78 file again so in the password
we should get the next stage hope this

54
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,419
isn't that big

55
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,960
you directory for that ok so we've got a
raw file we have something else in there

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,979
also we got a pcap nice our shark

57
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,510
let's go the first thing you want to do
my shark is statistics vertical

58
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,230
hierarchy which will show you the
breakdown of what kind of protocols in

59
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,830
the dump

60
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,830
so we've got some interesting stuff here

61
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:15,280
hypertext Transfer Protocol lots of that
some SMB traffic oft p data interesting

62
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,849
look at that final password or text who

63
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:32,440
okay so there we go have some data there
i'm gonna ah can I do that our copy

64
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,240
value we are so let's start a new file
here

65
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,639
oops

66
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,629
saving the bits of the passphrase in
there do like that so I don't forget to

67
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:50,710
the last time

68
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,430
okay so have to be data they should be
in a control session for that as well

69
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:02,080
let's see what's in there are dr. evil
logged in

70
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,590
cool password required for dr. will pass
mini-me

71
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:16,508
ok that's interesting ok so we could
probably have a look at what else sorry

72
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:22,960
I put probably look at what else is in
there except ftp data so

73
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:33,039
this is going far too slow we had some
HTTP traffic let's look at that go

74
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,869
ok so we've got some surf traffic

75
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:43,959
Oh dr. evil is apparently looking and
feeling credentials

76
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:53,529
that's interesting so let's find a way
to extract those from are so MTL mssb

77
00:07:53,529 --> 00:08:03,339
pcap there we go that looks like it
would my work just copy some stuff off

78
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,339
of github running on my machine what
it's worth the ground

79
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,670
so

80
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,670
that actually now Rick

81
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,830
yeah

82
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,270
maybe

83
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:28,859
there you have it i was talking much
from faster when i tried this earlier so

84
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:40,020
yeah Casey python okay thank you

85
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,950
so he probably wants the pcap

86
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,870
yeah

87
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,529
too perfect it's dumping credentials so
let's say

88
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,870
so there was also a hint in the readme
file i forgot to tell you about earlier

89
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:12,150
that said that he likes to reuse
passwords this guy so hopes gonna

90
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,980
just make a quick word list

91
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,089
okay so it's not empty lmp2 right

92
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,550
and we have our creds and we have a word
list which is called be let's run some

93
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:45,099
rules on that I don't do have a let's
just run the standard standard rules

94
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,430
didn't work

95
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:58,230
okay so some more complex rules paps
ecologic ones are good

96
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
there we go perfect

97
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:07,230
ok so we had step 3

98
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,889
let's assume that's also

99
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:26,029
narara but as 77 yes it is sneaky
fuckers we go and now we have our

100
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,769
oops

101
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,540
next stage ok so BMP file

102
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:45,959
how's that oh that looks like a crash
dump interesting to look at

103
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,709
genuine intel who got so much of
libraries huh

104
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,899
ok so if this is an a crash dump of the
LCS process they should probably be some

105
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:07,600
nice stuff hidden in there so let's use
our old friend he gets let's copy this

106
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,610
over so we can run into the windows
machine jump over to windows machine

107
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:29,500
let's have a look in here hopes so when
32-minute gets okay so say many dumb

108
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
yeah

109
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,480
what's it again is it logon passwords

110
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,230
yeah there we go ok so I'm going to have
a look at what is in here lots of fun

111
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,760
stuff from else s okay so we've got
another work piece of the final pass

112
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,020
phrase there are some more stuff i'm
just gonna take a copy of that quickly

113
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:12,710
run over here put it in our file perhaps
there we go so and the ftp stuff that we

114
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,210
saw its part 3 so we've actually missed
part one and two so let's go back to

115
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:23,330
that later on we see that this is
probably part 4 and we need the password

116
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,280
for the next stage

117
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,490
let's have a look we have some more
passwords that's an old password

118
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:36,050
dr. evil yeah we know that one already
that was for the last one stage five

119
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:44,300
from your fucking bailed EU ligo who may
be okay so

120
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,860
let's hope that 75 yep it seems to be a
substance fast oh ok

121
00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:00,209
I don't know I'm doing for time so
you're gonna have to kick me off one had

122
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:07,830
too much 50 mm interesting

123
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:19,130
look what's in there yeah looks like
memory from a virtual machine all right

124
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:28,280
interesting so let's use our favorite to
volatility let's see if I can remember

125
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:37,250
what to type as well so right i think so
yeah yeah there we go

126
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:44,600
so that's memory dump wrong sorry
physical memory done for the machine

127
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,850
that we can look at the volatility

128
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,440
so what's in here we've got lots of CMD
. XE that's interesting also got a

129
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,050
notepad so yeah I know there's a notepad
buffer search in volatility let's look

130
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,609
at that

131
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,610
yeah there we go

132
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,379
let's save that for later

133
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:13,379
let's have a look at those cds as well

134
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,730
now i can't remember what it's called
there's a series gambia

135
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,329
let's have a look at with what they've
been typing into those seemed on texts

136
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,329
might be interesting

137
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:43,560
ok we're almost there because it says
last and I don't think last is a an

138
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,920
archiver I think this is probably a
7-zip again

139
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:56,130
yeah looks like it ok so we've got a lot
of commands here little been there we go

140
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,210
freaking long password that can never be
cracked about that

141
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:14,040
let's try that yeah okay so stage 6 i'm
actually not taking stage all that often

142
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,980
that's cool so reverse me . sexy and
keys and secrets to the underground lair

143
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,970
ok so here's our final destination and
i'm going to guess that's the last part

144
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,150
of part of the passphrase for this so we
probably need to get the seventh and

145
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:40,140
password for this archive from reverse
me okay let's have a look so let's run

146
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:52,140
the idea demo projects with me that look
at their okay now remember what I forgot

147
00:15:52,140 --> 00:16:00,930
to do what you always do is look what
kind of house they are so

148
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:13,219
because I know that this is going to be
opes fact file that's ok just do this

149
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,170
area now let's go back to Ida

150
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,390
come on

151
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,560
reverse me again there we go ok so now
we have something

152
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,270
ok so we're reading something from input
we've got a loop here that's nice

153
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:44,260
let's make this a bit bigger so you guys
can see it and oh we're exploring the

154
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:57,580
input see 20 times loop goes around
around exploring something with this

155
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,230
okay

156
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,230
what's that

157
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
we're comparing

158
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,430
to get to the right password we follow
this branch so

159
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,720
we're going to fall out if we're going
to follow the loop if we've got the

160
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
wrong things so let's look there so yeah
there we go

161
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,380
you could probably can't see this
because I can't make it any bigger

162
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:36,940
that's too bad but here we have some hex
data

163
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,730
okay i'm going to copy that over to
somewhere where you guys can see it so

164
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,730
we had a nice

165
00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:01,479
my speed of text data there that we're
exploring the input string with sorry

166
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:04,479
we're exploring the interesting with
something and comparing it to this value

167
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:08,619
so if we explore this value with the
stuff that we're actually the input

168
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:12,580
string with them we should get what the
input string should be right with the

169
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,178
commutative properties of X or so let's
go back have a look what we actually

170
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:23,919
exploring this stuff with ok we're
actually exploring the input string with

171
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:31,509
the loop counter and the loop counter is
initialized to be 20 and it's

172
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:39,549
incremented each time we go down now
it's not incremented that's where my

173
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,899
being blind here one

174
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:52,090
no it's not incremented it's actually
updated to be the value that's in here

175
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:59,080
so i can probably do that in Python
let's look quickly

176
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:17,070
from ski for all X laughs I and it
doesn't like the spaces so this is crap

177
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,070
but i have to go for manual take up
spaces

178
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,430
I'm probably way over time already but
we're almost there almost there

179
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:36,990
ok so let's have our loop counter which
isn't it

180
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:44,550
initialize 224 character in X do

181
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:55,139
ok so let's say we had the character was
supposed to be placed with the character

182
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:02,640
explored i can find the keyboard that we
are with a I was right wasn't and then

183
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:14,340
we update a way the new value think that
was right and of course we also want to

184
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,139
friends are shit done something really
stupid

185
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
we need to do this as well so

186
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,179
yeah let's just go back and

187
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:37,120
wait that should be in in the buffer
already right so actually i might fuck

188
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
this up for you

189
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,870
Sorry Sorry

190
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:53,050
our shit yeah that's right that's right
that's right and also we want to print

191
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,760
now my phones ringing in the middle of
Easter really sucks and why did I

192
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:09,400
print.printer ago and then a should be
set to a sorry to the board of C which

193
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,510
is already ordered

194
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:19,030
there we go is that correct you know
sorry i fucked up to look at this again

195
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:22,030
so

196
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,178
are there we go so we're actually
loading the value of each time and it's

197
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:36,100
going to be the offset + 20 so that was
my mistake sorry about that should

198
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,629
rehearse this better actually

199
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:44,350
so let's do it again we go

200
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:51,850
and for each and see and then I've
already fucked up because a has to be 20

201
00:21:51,850 --> 00:22:05,949
already so a equals 20 and for cnx we do
print the character which is the order

202
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:17,289
of or the ordinal see and we saw that
with a and then we update a to be a plus

203
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:18,039
one

204
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,059
sorry that was the other in and that
should do it

205
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:31,240
there we go boo freaking hoo ok 70
extract stage6 final password

206
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:38,330
free kitty who we go

207
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:47,299
ok so now we only have the last part of
the piece of the puzzle which is the

208
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:53,750
first two so let's have a look at that
big freakin image again or actually

209
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:02,480
let's do a strings of that again a big
freaking image that I didn't really have

210
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,309
time to look at before what we're doing
that will do this stop ringing stupid

211
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:12,020
phone

212
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:23,480
ok so we've got number three we've got
number four and

213
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,140
and we're missing

214
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:43,639
really should rehearse this 5 and music
so we're missing number one and number

215
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,139
two

216
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:50,240
ok let's go back have a look at the big
ntfs image if there was anything

217
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,039
interesting hiding out in there

218
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:59,240
oh there we go that looks like number
one and number two

219
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:09,799
yes it is so again let's reconstruct
this lovely passphrase and it's going to

220
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,869
look something like this

221
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:20,840
yeah else got are going to freaking evil
you want evil

222
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,700
doctor

223
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
4 30 freaking years

224
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,410
yeah we know

225
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,410
ok cut me some friggin slack

226
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,010
you forget Scott we're in a volcano

227
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:54,300
we're surrounded but liquid hot magma
off

228
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:06,090
yeah and that was the last one was met
some sex so that's just taking

229
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:13,679
everything else away and for the last
piece of the puzzle

230
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,980
this isn't actually going to work i know
this since I tried this before if you

231
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,190
google this past friday at passphrase on
the internet you'll find lots of code

232
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,440
databases and the quote won't work
unless you correct the punctuation so

233
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,070
they're supposed to be a comma in there
as well easily found by google but i'm

234
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:38,669
not going to google it now because we
don't have time to let see was to keep

235
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,900
us database and

236
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,140
we go

237
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,870
we need to

238
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,980
come on

239
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,600
best

240
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,178
there we go we're done huh
